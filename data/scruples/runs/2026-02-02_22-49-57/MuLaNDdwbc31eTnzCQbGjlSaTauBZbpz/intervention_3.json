Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. So first, I need to consider both sides of the argument.\n\nThe author's perspective is that cat-calling is a problem and they're trying to discourage it by making the offenders uncomfortable. Their approach is to loudly boo them, like in a silent movie. They mention that this has led to some negative reactions from others, with different opinions from guys and girls. The author's rationale is to create an atmosphere where men stop such behavior, and they also find it funny. \n\nOn one hand, cat-calling is a form of harassment and can make people feel unsafe. The author is taking a stand against it, which could be seen as positive. Publicly calling out the cat-caller might deter others from doing the same, promoting a culture of accountability. If the author's actions are effective in reducing harassment, that's a good outcome. Also, the author is willing to face some backlash but hasn't faced physical harm so far.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author's method could escalate the situation. The cat-callers might become more aggressive or retaliate, which could put others at risk. The author admits that others think they're an asshole, with some people believing they're making the situation worse by drawing attention. There's a risk that instead of discouraging harassment, the author's actions might provoke the cat-callers, leading to confrontations that could be dangerous. Additionally, the author's size might make them less likely to be targeted, but not everyone has that advantage, so their approach might not be universally applicable or safe.\n\nAnother angle is the effectiveness of the method. If booing is met with cursing or threats, is it actually changing behavior, or just causing conflict? The author's main goal is to discourage the behavior by making the offenders uncomfortable. However, if the offenders are already antagonistic, the author's reaction might not have the intended effect. There's also the question of whether public confrontation is the best approach, as it could lead to more tension without resolving the underlying issue of harassment.\n\nThe author also mentions that some women think they're making things worse. This is an important point because the goal is to support those being harassed. If the author's actions are causing more discomfort to the victims or bystanders, that could be counterproductive. The key is whether the method is genuinely helping the people affected (the women being cat-called) or if it's just the author's way of dealing with their own frustration.\n\nIn terms of personal responsibility, the author is trying to be proactive, which is commendable. However, the method might not be the most effective or safest. There are other ways to address harassment, like reporting to authorities, supporting victims, or promoting education and awareness. The author's approach is direct and confrontational, which can be effective in some contexts but might not be the best strategy in a public space where tensions can quickly escalate.\n\nSo, considering all these points: the intention is good, but the method may have unintended consequences. The author might not be in the wrong because they're trying to address a harmful behavior, but their approach could be problematic. However, the question is whether they are morally in the wrong. If the action is meant to stop harassment and the author is willing to face personal risk, it's a gray area. But if their actions are causing more harm or not effective, then perhaps they are in the wrong. Since the author has not caused physical harm and is trying to create a positive change, even if it's not universally accepted, it's possible they are not in the wrong. However, the fact that some people (especially those being harassed) think it's making things worse suggests that there's a valid concern. So maybe the answer is that they are in the wrong because their method could be more harmful than helpful, even with good intentions.\n"
