Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand it correctly. The author moved to a big city two months ago and started loudly \"booo!\"-ing at cat-caller guys, like in a silent movie. They get cursed at sometimes and threats, but haven't been physically attacked yet. People around them don't think they're doing the right thing\u2014guys call them a \"white knight\" and think they're asking for a punch, while girls think they're making the situation worse. The author's reasoning is to make the cat-callers uncomfortable and create an environment where others tell them to stop. They also admit they find it funny. Now they're wondering if they're an asshole and should stop.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if their actions are justified. Cat-calling is a form of harassment, which is generally bad. The author is trying to address this by publicly shaming the perpetrators. On one hand, they're standing up against harassment, which is a positive intent. But the method they're using is loud heckling, which could escalate the situation. The key points here are the effectiveness of their approach and whether it's appropriate.\n\nThe author argues that making the cat-caller uncomfortable might discourage their behavior. However, if the heckling leads to more conflict or makes the victim feel more self-conscious, it might not be helpful. The girl's perspective is that it draws attention and worsens the situation. That's a valid concern because if a woman is being harassed and someone starts booing, it might make her feel like she's now a target for the heckler as well, or it might not actually stop the harassment but just add another problem.\n\nAlso, the author is taking the role of a \"white knight,\" which can sometimes be seen as overstepping. It's possible that the person being harassed wants to handle it themselves and might not appreciate a stranger getting involved. The threats the author receives suggest that their approach is confrontational, which could lead to physical altercations, even if it hasn't happened yet.\n\nThe question is whether their action is in the wrong. The author's intention is good, but the method might be problematic. Effective ways to address harassment often involve supporting the victim and reporting to authorities if possible. Public heckling can be seen as aggressive and might not align with what the victim needs. It's possible that the author's actions are being perceived as disruptive rather than supportive. However, some might argue that bystander intervention is important, even if it's in the form of public shaming. But the negative reactions from others (both men and women thinking it's making things worse) indicate that there's a social cost.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the method is appropriate despite the good intention. Since the author is causing discomfort to both the harasser and potentially the victims, and it's leading to hostility, it's likely that their approach is not the best way to address the issue. Therefore, they are in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
