Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The author explains that they started doing this two months after moving to a big city. Their motivation is standing up against catcalling by making a loud \"booo!\" sound, similar to booing a villain. They've faced some backlash with cussing and threats, but no one has actually confronted them physically. The author's friends and others think they're being an asshole, either as a \"white knight\" or making things worse by drawing attention. The author's rationale is that making the cat-caller uncomfortable might discourage the behavior and create a better atmosphere where others tell the cat-caller off. They also admit they find it funny but are questioning if they're wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's actions are justified. Catcalling is widely considered unacceptable behavior, so supporting or opposing it could depend on the method used. The author's method is public heckling. The question is whether this response is appropriate.\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to combat a form of harassment. By booing the cat-caller, they're supporting the person being harassed and potentially deterring the cat-caller. This could be seen as a positive action. Also, the author isn't engaging in physical confrontation or verbal abuse; they're using a non-violent, public shaming approach. Some people might view this as a reasonable and effective way to address the problem in the moment, especially in a public space where others might witness the interaction.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author is escalating the situation. By drawing attention, they could make the victim feel more uncomfortable, even if that's not their intention. There's also the aspect of the author taking on a self-appointed role as a defender. The term \"white knight\" is used here, suggesting that the author might be overstepping, assuming the role of protector without the consent of the person being catcalled. Additionally, the author mentions that others, including both men and women, think they're causing more harm. Women might feel that the author's intervention adds another layer of discomfort for the victim, who might now have to deal with both the catcaller and the heckler. However, the author argues that creating an environment where people feel empowered to stop such behavior is beneficial.\n\nConsidering the author's intent versus the consequences. The intent is to stop harassment, which is a noble goal. The consequences include threats but no actual harm. The author is aware of the potential for escalation but seems to believe their approach is effective. The key here is whether the method is appropriate. Public shaming can be a contentious tactic; while it might deter the cat-caller in the moment, it could also lead to more aggression. However, since the author has not faced physical confrontation yet, maybe their method is working in some capacity.\n\nAnother angle is the social norms. In some cultures, direct confrontation in public might be frowned upon, whereas in others, it's seen as standing up against injustice. The author is in a big city, which might have a more diverse attitude towards such actions. The fact that the author is a \"fairly big fucker\" might also contribute to others not physically confronting them, thus reducing the risk of violence.\n\nThere's also the question of whether the author is overstepping by inserting themselves into a situation that doesn't directly involve them. However, advocating against harassment is generally considered a positive action, and many would support such behavior, even if it's done in a confrontational manner.\n\nIn summary, the author's actions are aimed at stopping a harmful behavior, using a non-violent method. While there are valid concerns about potential escalation and unintended consequences, the intent and the general societal stance against catcalling support the author's position. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
