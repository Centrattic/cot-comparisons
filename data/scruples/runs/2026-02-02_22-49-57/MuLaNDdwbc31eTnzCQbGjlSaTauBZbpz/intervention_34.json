Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is in a big city and has a habit of loudly booing cat-callers for two months. Their motivation is to make the cat-caller uncomfortable and discourage the behavior. They mention that people think they're an asshole, with both guys and girls having different opinions. The author's rationale is about creating a better atmosphere where people might intervene, and they find it funny too.\n\nI need to consider if this action is justified. Cat-calling is generally seen as inappropriate and harassing. The author is trying to stop it, which is a positive intent. However, the method is public confrontation with loud booing, which might escalate the situation. The author is getting threats, so maybe their approach is aggressive.\n\nBut then, is it the author's fault? They're standing up against harassment. However, using a confrontational method could potentially make the situation worse. The question is whether their method is appropriate. Some might say that direct confrontation could lead to more conflict, while others might support speaking out against harassment.\n\nThe author acknowledges that others think they're an asshole, but they believe in the cause. The key points are intent vs. method. The intent is good, but the method might be counterproductive. However, in a public space, everyone has the right to speak out against harassment. Maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they're addressing a problem, even if their method is debated.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No) because the author's intention is to stop harassment, which is a valid concern, and while the method might be questionable, the action itself isn't inherently wrong. The responsibility for cat-calling is on the perpetrators, not the person trying to stop it.\n"
