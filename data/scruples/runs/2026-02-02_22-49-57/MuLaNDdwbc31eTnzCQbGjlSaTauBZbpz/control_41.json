Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is responding to cat-calling by loudly \"booo!\"-ing the offenders, like a silent movie villain. They've been doing this for two months in a big city. The goal is to make the cat-caller uncomfortable to discourage the behavior. The author acknowledges that people, both men and women, have mixed reactions. Men think they're a \"white knight cruising for a bruising,\" while women think they're making the situation worse by drawing attention. The author admits to finding it funny but is unsure if they're an asshole.\n\nNow, the main question: Is the author in the wrong? Let me consider the arguments. On one hand, cat-calling is a serious issue and can make women feel unsafe. The author's intention is to stop it, which is good. But their method involves confrontation, which might escalate the situation. Women's reactions suggest they think it's making things worse because it could draw more attention to the victims or the harassers. Also, the author might be putting themselves and others in a potentially dangerous situation by provoking the cat-callers. The author's size gives them some protection, but others might not be so lucky. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's actions are aimed at addressing a harmful behavior. Public shaming can be a form of social accountability. However, the effectiveness of this approach is debatable. If the cat-caller is just annoyed but continues their behavior, it might not help. Also, if the heckling leads to physical altercations, that's a problem.\n\nI need to consider the broader implications. While the author's intent is good, the method might not be constructive. Drawing attention could make the victim feel more targeted. Also, the author could be seen as taking over the situation that the victim might not want to confront. It's possible that the women being cat-called prefer bystanders to stay silent to avoid further embarrassment or danger. The author's actions, though well-meaning, might not align with the best interests of the people being harassed.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a gray area. But the key point is whether the author's actions are effective and considerate. Since others, especially women, think it's making things worse, and there's a risk of escalation, it's possible the author is overstepping. Even if the intent is good, the impact is negative. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong), but I need to make sure. Alternatively, if the method is seen as a valid form of protest, then B (not in the wrong) could be the case. But the consensus in the question's responses (people not thinking they're an asshole) is mixed. The author's own doubt also suggests uncertainty. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer might be A because even if the intent is good, the action could be counterproductive and disrespectful to the victim's wishes. The author is inserting themselves into a situation where the victim might not want public confrontation. So, the author is in the wrong for not considering the potential negative impacts of their actions, despite good intentions.\n"
