Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. The person started doing this after moving to a big city, and their approach is to make a loud \"booo!\" sound at the cat-callers to make them uncomfortable. They get some negative reactions but so far no physical altercations. The community's reaction is mixed: guys think they're a \"white knight\" risking a beating, and girls think they're making it worse by drawing attention. The author's rationale is to discourage the behavior by making it uncomfortable for the cat-callers and maybe encourage others to stop it. They also admit they find it funny.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let's break it down.\n\nOn one hand, cat-calling is generally considered harassment, and intervening can be seen as supporting a safer environment. The author is trying to stop a negative behavior. However, the method they're using\u2014publicly heckling\u2014might have unintended consequences. The author's own friends and others think they might be an asshole. The girls' perspective is that they're making the situation worse by drawing attention. But the author's intention is to create an atmosphere where people feel empowered to stop cat-calling.\n\nBut is the method appropriate? Publicly shaming someone could escalate the situation. For example, if the cat-caller becomes more aggressive in response. Also, the author is a \"fairly big fucker\" and no one has attacked them yet, but that could change. The question is whether the author's actions are justified despite the mixed reactions.\n\nIn some contexts, public shaming can be seen as a form of intervention, but it's not always effective. The author might be overstepping by making a spectacle, which could potentially put others at risk if the situation escalates. However, the author isn't engaging in physical confrontation or threats; just verbal heckling. The line between standing up for others and causing unnecessary conflict is thin.\n\nAnother angle: the author's own admission of hypocrisy. They mention they're a hypocrite, which might imply they have their own issues. But that doesn't necessarily make their intervention wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to address a problem (harassment) and is willing to take personal risks to do so. If their actions are non-violent and their intent is positive, even if the method is controversial, they might not be in the wrong. The response to cat-calling is a societal issue, and individual actions can contribute to cultural change.\n\nBut the \"AITA\" question is about whether they're an asshole. The girls' perspective is that it's making the situation worse by drawing attention. If the author's actions lead to more attention being drawn to the victim or escalate the harasser's behavior, that could be problematic. However, without evidence that their actions have actually caused harm, it's hard to say they're wrong.\n\nSo, the author's actions are a form of activism, albeit a confrontational one. Depending on cultural norms and the specific context, this could be seen as acceptable or not. In some places, public shaming is a common tactic. In others, it's seen as overstepping. The key points are: non-violent, intent to discourage harassment, and the mixed reactions from others.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's method is acceptable. If the method is non-violent and the intent is good, even if others disagree, they might not be in the wrong. The fact that no one has physically retaliated yet and the author is aware of potential risks suggests they're being cautious. However, the potential for escalation is a valid concern. But since the question is about being in the wrong, and the author isn't breaking laws or causing direct harm, the answer might be B (No).\n"
