Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for heckling cat-callers. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is loud when they see cat-calling, using a \"booo!\" like in a silent movie. Their goal is to make the cat-caller uncomfortable to discourage the behavior. They\u2019ve had some pushback, like curses and threats, but no actual confrontation. The people around think they're an asshole, with some seeing it as a good deed but others thinking it makes things worse.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLet me consider the ethical aspects. Cat-calling is generally seen as harassment, so trying to stop it is a positive intent. However, the method here is public shaming. The author is making a scene, which could escalate the situation. On one hand, they're trying to address a harmful act. On the other, their approach might be counterproductive by drawing attention, potentially making the victim more uncomfortable, or even provoking the harasser. \n\nThe author mentions that some people think they're helping, others think they're making it worse. But the key here is the effectiveness and the approach. Public shaming isn't a universally accepted method. It's possible that by loudly reacting, the author is not just targeting the harasser but also possibly embarrassing them in a way that's not constructive. Also, the author is a big person, so there's a physical intimidation factor here. \n\nAnother angle: is the author overstepping by taking matters into their own hands? While cat-calling is wrong, the appropriate response might be to support the victim without adding to the chaos. The author's actions might be seen as vigilantism, which can have unintended consequences. \n\nThe author's rationale is to create a culture where others also call out the behavior. But if their actions are causing more harm, like making the situation uncomfortable for everyone involved, including the victim, that's a problem. The humor the author finds in the situation might also trivialize the issue. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's intent is good, but the method could be questionable. The question isn't just about the action but whether it's the right approach. Since the author is asking if they're the asshole, and many people are saying they are, even if their intent is good, their method might still be wrong. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the approach is causing more harm than good, then maybe A. But if the intent is to stop harassment, maybe B. It's tricky. However, since the author is being confrontational and it's leading to threats, it's possible that their method is not appropriate. Hence, the answer might be A.\n"
