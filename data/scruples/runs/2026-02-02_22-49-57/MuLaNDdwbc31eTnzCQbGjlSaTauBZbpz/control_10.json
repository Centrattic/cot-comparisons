Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this AITA question. So the user is asking if they're the asshole for loudly heckling cat-callers. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is in a big city, where cat-calling is an issue. They've started to publicly shame these cat-callers by booing them like a movie villain. The response from others has been mixed: some see them as a white knight, others as an asshole. The cat-callers themselves get angry but haven't escalated beyond words. The author's reasoning is that making the cat-caller uncomfortable might discourage the behavior and create a culture where others also speak up. However, they acknowledge that their actions might be counterproductive by drawing attention and making things worse for the victims.\n\nNow, the main ethical points here. Cat-calling is a form of harassment, so the author's intent is to stop it, which is good. But the method involves public shaming. Public shaming can have unintended consequences. For example, if the cat-caller is publicly humiliated, they might react aggressively, which could put others in danger. The author mentions that they're a big person, so maybe they feel safe, but others might not. Also, drawing attention to the situation might make the victim more uncomfortable. The author's approach might not address the root issue and could be seen as vigilantism, which is not the role of a bystander. There's also the aspect of consent; the author is intervening without the victim's consent, which could be problematic.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention is to create a safer environment by discouraging harassment. They might be trying to foster a culture where such behavior isn't tolerated. But the methods used could be counterproductive. The question is whether the ends justify the means. While the intent is good, the method might be harmful. Public shaming can sometimes lead to more conflict and might not actually stop the behavior effectively. Also, the author's actions might be seen as overstepping, as they are inserting themselves into a situation that the victim might not want or need. The author should consider if there are better, less confrontational ways to address the issue, like supporting policies or educational efforts.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because their method, while well-intentioned, could make the situation worse for the victims and potentially escalate conflicts. The right approach might be to support systemic changes or educate others rather than direct confrontation. The answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
