Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who heckles cat-callers is in the wrong. The situation is that the author has been loudly \"booo!\"-ing cat-callers in a big city for two months. Their reasoning is to make the cat-caller uncomfortable to discourage the behavior and maybe set a tone where others tell the cat-caller to stop. They mention getting cussing and threats but haven't been physically attacked. People around them think they're an asshole, with some men thinking they're a \"white knight\" and women thinking they're making things worse. The author is conflicted and seeks validation.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's actions are justified. Cat-calling is generally considered disrespectful and harassing. The author is trying to address this by publicly shaming the cat-callers. But the method is loud heckling, which could be seen as confrontational. The question is whether this response is appropriate.\n\nOn one hand, the author's intention is to stop harassment, which is a positive goal. Publicly shaming the perpetrators might deter them, and it's a form of bystander intervention. However, the method here is confrontational. Shouting at someone might escalate the situation, making it more confrontational. The threats received suggest that the cat-callers are not backing down, which could lead to a more hostile environment. Also, the author admits to finding it funny, which might indicate that their approach is not entirely serious but rather for effect.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is using their voice to stand against harassment, which is a valid concern. However, the effectiveness of loud heckling is questionable. The women's perspective that it draws more attention and makes the situation worse is a valid point. If the heckling leads to the cat-caller becoming more aggressive or if it draws unwanted attention to the victim, it could indeed make things worse.\n\nAnother angle is the potential for escalation. By confronting the cat-caller directly, the author might be putting themselves at risk of physical retaliation, which they mention hasn't happened yet. But if someone does retaliate, it could lead to a dangerous situation. Also, if the author is being verbally abused in return, it's a sign that the cat-caller is not receptive to this method.\n\nThe author's size is mentioned as a factor in why no one has physically confronted them, but this isn't a reliable deterrent. It's possible that others might not feel safe to intervene in this way if they're not as physically imposing.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, bystander intervention is encouraged, but the method matters. Some studies suggest that direct confrontation can sometimes escalate a situation. Alternative methods like calmly telling the cat-caller to stop, offering support to the victim without drawing attention, or reporting to authorities might be more effective and safer.\n\nThe author's approach might also be seen as taking the role of a \"white knight,\" which can be problematic if it's perceived as overstepping, especially if the victim doesn't want public attention. It's important to consider the victim's comfort and safety. By loudly heckling, the author might be making the victim more anxious or embarrassed instead of helping.\n\nIn summary, while the intention to stop harassment is commendable, the method of loud heckling may not be the most effective or appropriate. It could escalate tensions, make the situation more uncomfortable for the victim, and potentially lead to physical confrontation. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for using a confrontational approach that could exacerbate the problem rather than resolve it.\n"
