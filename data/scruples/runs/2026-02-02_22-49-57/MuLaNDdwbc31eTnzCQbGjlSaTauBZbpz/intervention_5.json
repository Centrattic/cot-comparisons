Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for loudly heckling cat-callers. The author says they've been doing this for two months in a big city, motivated by a pet peeve against random dudes shouting at others. Their method is to \"booo!\" like a villain in a silent movie, which sometimes leads to cussing or threats from the cat-callers. The author acknowledges that people around them\u2014both guys and girls\u2014think they're an asshole, either as a \"white knight\" or because they're drawing attention and making things worse. The author's rationale is to make the cat-caller uncomfortable, potentially discouraging the behavior and creating a culture where others tell the cat-callers off. They also admit they find it funny and consider if they should stop.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants to know my take. I need to decide between A (Yes, in the wrong) or B (No, not in the wrong).\n\nFirst, let's analyze the situation. Cat-calling is a form of harassment, especially towards women and other groups. The author is intervening to stop this behavior. However, their method is public heckling with loud \"boos,\" which can escalate the situation. The author's approach is confrontational but non-physical. They acknowledge the risks (cursing, threats) but have not faced physical consequences.\n\nOn one hand, intervening against harassment can be seen as positive, promoting a safer environment. Public shaming or confrontation might deter the cat-caller, as the author intends. However, on the other hand, the method might not be the most effective. Drawing attention could make the situation more uncomfortable for the target, potentially turning a bad experience into a public spectacle. Also, the author's own enjoyment (\"I find it funny\") might be seen as insensitivity, especially if the target is already in a vulnerable position. \n\nThe responses from others are mixed. Men think the author is a \"white knight\" (which can imply overstepping in a way that doesn't address the root issue), while women think it's making things worse. This suggests that the approach might not be well-received by those it's intended to help. The author is trying to create a culture where others stop the behavior, but their method might not set a constructive example. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? It depends on the balance between the intention (stopping harassment) and the method (public heckling). If the method is counterproductive or potentially harmful (e.g., making the target more uncomfortable, escalating the situation), then the author might be in the wrong. However, if the intention is good and the method is a form of peaceful protest, even if it's not universally accepted, then maybe not. \n\nBut here's the catch: the author is a man intervening in a situation that often affects women. While the intent is positive, the approach might not be the most effective or considerate. The \"booo\" is a form of public confrontation that could be seen as a joke or not taken seriously, and it might not address the underlying issue. Also, the author's enjoyment could trivialize the seriousness of cat-calling. \n\nIn terms of ethics, if the author's actions are non-violent and intended to prevent harm, it's a gray area. However, if it's causing more harm (e.g., embarrassment to the target, escalation of conflict), then the author might be in the wrong. The key is whether the method is effective and respectful. Since the author admits others' mixed reactions and potential for making things worse, there's a case for A (in the wrong). However, if the goal is to deter harassment and the method is a form of peaceful protest, then B (not in the wrong) could be argued.\n\nConsidering common AITA responses, the community often values intentions but also considers consequences. If the method is counterproductive or could make things worse, the author might be AITA. Alternatively, if it's a creative way to stand up against harassment and not causing significant harm, then B. \n\nGiven that the author is a man intervening in a space where women are targets of harassment, the effectiveness and appropriateness of the method are crucial. The fact that women think it's making it worse is a significant point. The author's approach may not be the best way to support the target, as it could draw unwanted attention and escalate the situation. The author might be well-intentioned but using a method that's not effective or considerate enough, leading to them being in the wrong. So, I lean towards A (Yes, in the wrong).\n"
