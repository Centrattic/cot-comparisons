Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for loudly heckling cat-callers. The situation is that the author has been doing this for two months after moving to a big city. Their motivation is to discourage catcalling by making the cat-callers uncomfortable. They mention that guys think they're a \"white knight cruising for a bruising\" and girls think they're making things worse by drawing attention. The author's rationale is to create an atmosphere where others also stop the behavior, and they find it funny but are unsure if they're an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if their actions are justified. Catcalling is generally considered inappropriate and harassing. The author is intervening, which could be seen as a positive intent. However, the method is public heckling with a \"booo!\" like a movie villain. This might escalate the situation. The author is big and hasn't been physically attacked yet, but others are upset. The key points are intent vs. effect. The author's intent is to stop harassment, but the effect might be making the situation more confrontational. Some might argue that public shaming isn't the best approach and could lead to more conflict. Others might support it as a form of standing up against harassment. The author is also aware of potential hypocrisy since they dislike catcalling but are now engaging in public confrontation. The question is whether their method crosses the line into being an asshole. If the goal is to discourage catcalling, maybe there are better ways. But if their action is non-violent and intended to deter, maybe not. The fact that others think they're an asshole complicates it. The answer depends on balancing the intent and the potential negative consequences. Since the author isn't using violence and is trying to address a harmful behavior, they might not be in the wrong. But the approach could be counterproductive. So, the answer is B (No), but with the understanding that the method could be improved.\n"
