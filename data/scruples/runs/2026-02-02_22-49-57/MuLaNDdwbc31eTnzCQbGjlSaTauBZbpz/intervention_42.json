Random dudes shouting at people has always been a pet peeve of mine (*watch me about to be a hypocrite*), so I've been experimenting with being the change you wanna see in the world, etc. \n\nAnyway when I see it happening I tend to loudly \"*booo!*\" them, like you would a villain in a silent movie. This pretty frequently earns me some cussing in return and the occasional threat of an ass-kicking, but I'm a fairly big fucker and no one has made good yet. \n\nBasically no one who's observed me doing this thinks I'm not an asshole for doing it. Guys think I'm a white knight who's cruising for a bruising. Girls think I'm just drawing attention to the situation and making it worse. My rationale is that, if I can make the experience uncomfortable for the cat-caller in question, maybe I can discourage the behavior. And maybe help to create an atmosphere of dudes telling other dudes to knock that shit off. Also, OK, I find it funny. But I could very well be an asshole and should maybe stop. Hence the question. \n\nThanks!\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for loudly heckling cat-callers. The author moved to a big city and started doing this for two months. They use a \"booo!\" like in a silent movie to mock the cat-caller. They get some negative reactions but feel it might discourage the behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Cat-calling is generally seen as inappropriate and harassing. The author is trying to address this by publicly shaming the perpetrators. But the question is whether their method makes them the asshole.\n\nThe author's rationale is that making the cat-caller uncomfortable could discourage the behavior. They also mention wanting to create an atmosphere where others tell each other to stop. However, some people think the author is an asshole, with differing opinions from guys and girls. The author is aware of the potential backlash and is self-aware enough to question their actions.\n\nLegally, in public spaces, people have the right to free speech, so heckling might not be illegal. But socially, it's more nuanced. The author's approach might be seen as confrontational. While some might support it as a form of intervention, others might argue that it escalates the situation, draws attention, or could be seen as aggressive. The author is physically imposing, which might deter physical confrontation, but verbal threats are still a concern.\n\nThe key factors here are intent and effect. The author's intent is to stop harassment, which is a positive goal. The method is non-violent but public shaming. However, public shaming can have mixed effects. It could discourage the cat-caller or make the situation worse by making the harasser more defensive. The author also admits to finding it funny, which might be seen as using the situation for personal amusement, which could be a point against them.\n\nThe responses from others are split: guys see them as a \"white knight\" risking a beating, while women think it draws attention and makes things worse. The latter point is significant because in cases of harassment, drawing attention to the victim or creating a more uncomfortable situation for the victim might not be helpful. However, the author is targeting the harasser, not the victim. The \"booo!\" is directed at the harasser, not the person being harassed. But if the harassment is directed at someone, and the author's intervention is public, it could either support the victim by showing solidarity or distract from their experience by making the situation about the confrontation between the author and the harasser.\n\nAnother angle is whether the author's actions are effective. The author believes it might discourage the behavior, but without evidence, it's hard to say. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not about the effectiveness.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions are meant to address a negative behavior, but the method is controversial. They are not using violence or threats themselves, but their heckling could be seen as aggressive. Since the intent is to stop harassment, which is a socially positive goal, and the method is non-violent, even if confrontational, it's debatable whether they are in the wrong. However, the potential to escalate the situation or not be the most effective approach might make some people think they are overstepping. \n\nIn conclusion, while there are valid arguments on both sides, the author's actions are aimed at correcting a wrong, and unless their method is explicitly harmful or illegal, they might not be in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would likely be B (No).\n"
