Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not changing their daughter's diaper. The situation is that the author forgot to change the diaper for a 2.5-year-old, who was in a pull-up. The husband got angry when he changed her and found it full, leading to some conflict.\n\nFirst, 2.5 years old is old enough to maybe be using the potty, but pull-ups are still used sometimes. The author says she forgot, which could be due to being busy with dinner and a stressful day. The husband claims she left it for 5 hours, which she disputes. He got angry and maybe even yelled, which the author felt was yelling but he denies. \n\nThe key points here are whether forgetting once is a valid excuse. Since the author mentions that this never happens and it was an exception due to stress and being occupied, it's a one-time slip-up. The husband's reaction seems disproportionate, especially if the child wasn't harmed. The author didn't intentionally neglect the child; it was an oversight. The husband's anger over getting covered in pee seems more about his own discomfort than the child's well-being. \n\nThe author tried to ask for help, which shows she was aware of the situation. The husband's response of anger and cutting off her explanation might be the bigger issue here. The author left the room to avoid arguing, which is a common problem in their relationship. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The mistake was a one-time thing under stress, and the husband's reaction is more about his own frustration than the child's welfare. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
