Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the mother forgetting to change her daughter's diaper, and the husband getting angry about it.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 2.5 years old, using pull-ups. The husband came home, and the mother asked him to change the diaper. He did, and then got upset because the diaper was full and the clothes were wet. The mother says it wasn't 5 hours, but he claims it was. She was stressed and busy with dinner.\n\nSo, is the mother at fault? Well, normally, changing a diaper regularly is expected, but the key points here are that this is not a usual occurrence. The mother forgot due to a stressful day and was in the middle of cooking. She did ask her husband to help, which she might have done. The husband's reaction seems exaggerated. He got angry and kicked something, then accused her of leaving it for 5 hours, which she denies. His anger leading to yelling (as the mother felt) and making it about disrespect because he got pee on him seems like overreacting. The mother left the room to avoid arguing, which shows she's trying to prevent conflict.\n\nThe husband's behavior here is more concerning. He didn't handle the situation calmly. Even if the diaper was not changed timely, his reaction is disproportionate. The mother isn't at fault here for a one-time oversight, especially under stress. The husband should have communicated better or handled the situation without anger. So, the answer is B; the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
