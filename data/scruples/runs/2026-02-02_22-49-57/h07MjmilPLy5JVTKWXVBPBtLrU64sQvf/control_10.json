Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves forgetting to change their daughter's diaper, which is a common responsibility in parenting. The child is 2.5 years old, and she was in a pull-up that doesn't hold as much. The parent was making dinner when they realized the mistake. They asked their husband to change it, but he got angry, threw something, and was upset about the mess. The parent says it wasn't intentional and that it's not a recurring issue. The husband claims it was 5 hours and that it was disrespectful because he got covered in pee. \n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the parent did something wrong. Forgetting once, especially when it's not a usual occurrence, might not be a big deal. However, leaving a diaper unattended long enough to cause a mess could be seen as neglectful. But the parent did ask their partner to help once they realized the mistake. The husband's reaction seems extreme, but maybe he's stressed too. \n\nThe key points: The parent forgot due to a stressful day and was in the middle of cooking. They didn't mean to neglect the child. The husband's anger and the claim of 5 hours might be an overreaction. The parent left the situation to avoid conflict, which isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both partners might share in childcare duties. The parent did reach out for help once they noticed. So, the parent isn't entirely at fault. The husband's reaction might be the bigger issue here. \n\nBut maybe the parent should have changed the diaper earlier. However, since it's a one-time incident and not a pattern, it's hard to say they're in the wrong. So the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
