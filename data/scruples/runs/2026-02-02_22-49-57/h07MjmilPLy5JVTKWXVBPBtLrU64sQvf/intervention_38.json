Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not changing their daughter's diaper. Let me read through the details again.\n\nThe user's daughter is 2.5 years old and was in a pull-up. The husband came home while the user was making dinner. The user forgot to change the diaper, and when she realized, she asked the husband to help. He changed her diaper but got angry, saying the diaper was full and her clothes were wet. He was upset and even kicked something. The user says it was a stressful day and she lost track of time. The husband claims she left it for 5 hours (which she says isn't true) and that she was disrespectful because his clothes got wet. The user left to avoid the argument.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the user is at fault. The daughter is 2.5, so using pull-ups might be normal for occasional use, but diapers are usually for younger kids. However, the user mentions that this is not something that ever happens. So it's an exception. The user was in the middle of making dinner, and the husband was wrestling with the child before the user asked him to change the diaper. The user forgot due to stress and time constraints.\n\nThe husband's reaction seems disproportionate. Throwing or kicking something indicates anger. He says the diaper was left for 5 hours, but the user disputes this. Also, he's upset about getting his clothes wet, which seems like a minor issue given the context. Changing a child's diaper occasionally getting wet is part of parenting, and expecting one parent not to have a slip-up every once in a while is normal, but the reaction here might be over the top.\n\nThe user tried to explain herself but was cut off. The husband's anger might stem from stress or other underlying issues. The user left to avoid the argument, which isn't healthy in the long run, but in this specific situation, the mistake was minor. The fact that this is a one-time occurrence and the user is otherwise consistent with diaper changes suggests she's not negligent.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the user isn't in the wrong. The husband's reaction is the issue here. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
