Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not changing their 2.5-year-old daughter's diaper. The husband got angry when he found out and there's some tension in the background.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 2.5 years old. At that age, many kids are using pull-ups and moving towards potty training. So maybe she's not in diapers anymore, but using pull-ups. The author forgot to change her, which led to some mess. The husband took over, got angry, and there's a conflict here.\n\nThe author mentions they don't usually forget, but yesterday was a stressful day. They were in the middle of making dinner when they realized they had forgotten. The husband estimated 5 hours, but the author says that's not true. The husband was upset about the mess affecting him, but the author left the room to avoid an argument.\n\nNow, considering the child's well-being. The main issue is that the diaper was full and she was in a pull-up that doesn't hold as much. But since she's 2.5, maybe she can communicate when she needs to go. However, if she's in a pull-up, maybe she hasn't fully transitioned to potty training yet. So forgetting once in a while might be understandable, especially on a stressful day.\n\nThe author was busy with dinner, which is a common parental task. They asked the husband to help, which shows they tried to delegate. The husband's reaction seems harsh. Getting angry over a diaper mishap, especially since it's a one-time occurrence, might indicate he's overreacting. Also, the author left because they didn't want to argue, which isn't the right approach, but it's not uncommon in strained relationships.\n\nThe husband's claim that it was disrespectful because he got covered in pee is questionable. Parents do handle messes, and expecting the other parent to do it without getting upset might be part of normal co-parenting. However, yelling and being confrontational is not healthy.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author forgot once due to stress, not a recurring issue. They asked for help. The husband overreacted, maybe projecting other issues. The author's response was to avoid conflict, which isn't ideal but not necessarily their fault here.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The husband's reaction is more concerning. So the answer should be B.\n"
