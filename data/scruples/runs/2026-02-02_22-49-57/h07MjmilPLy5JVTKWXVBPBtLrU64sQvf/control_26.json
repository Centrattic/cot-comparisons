Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent forgetting to change their daughter's diaper, which led to some conflict.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 2.5 years old and was in a pull-up. The mother forgot to change her, and the husband ended up changing her, getting upset because the diaper was full and the clothes were wet. The mother claims it was a one-time mistake due to a stressful day while making dinner. The husband is angry, saying she left her for 5 hours (which she denies) and feels disrespected because he got covered in pee.\n\nNow, the key points here. The mother usually changes the diaper regularly, but this time, due to stress and being in the middle of dinner, she forgot. The husband took over, got angry, and there's a disagreement on the timeline. The mother left the room to avoid arguing. \n\nFrom a parenting perspective, forgetting once in a while isn't abnormal, especially with a stressful day. The child isn't harmed, just a wet diaper. The husband's reaction seems excessive. He might be frustrated, but yelling or being angry about a single incident like this, especially since it's rare, seems over the top. Also, the mother was trying to manage dinner and asked for help, which he provided but then reacted negatively. \n\nThe husband's claim about 5 hours might be inaccurate, which the mother disputes. If he's exaggerating, that adds to the problem. His reaction leading to a shouting match isn't helpful either. The mother's decision to leave the room to avoid conflict is understandable. \n\nSo, the mother isn't in the wrong for a one-time mistake, especially given the stress. The husband's reaction is more problematic. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
