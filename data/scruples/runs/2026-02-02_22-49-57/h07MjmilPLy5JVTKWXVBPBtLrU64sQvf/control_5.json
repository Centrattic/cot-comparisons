Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about not changing their 2.5-year-old daughter's diaper. The key points are:\n\nThe mother forgot to change the diaper because she was making dinner after a stressful day. The husband got home and asked if he could help, then got angry when he found out. He claims she left it for 5 hours (which she says isn't true) and that it was disrespectful because he got covered in pee.\n\nFirst, the kid is 2.5, so using pull-ups is normal. The mother usually changes the diaper regularly. The mistake here was due to being busy and stressed. The husband was helping by taking over, but then got upset. The mother didn't yell back and left to avoid an argument.\n\nThe husband's reaction seems harsh. He's upset about the mess and the fact that the mother forgot, but it's a one-time incident. The mother isn't in the wrong because everyone makes mistakes. The husband's claim that it was disrespectful is a bit much, especially since it was an accident. The key is that the daughter's needs were usually met, and this was an exception. The mother handled it by letting him help, and the husband's anger seems disproportionate. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
