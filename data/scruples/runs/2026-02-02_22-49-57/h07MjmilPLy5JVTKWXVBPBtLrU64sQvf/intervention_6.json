Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about not changing their daughter's diaper when their husband got home. The daughter is 2.5 years old, using pull-ups. The mother forgot to change the diaper, and the husband ended up changing her but got upset because the diaper was really full and the clothes were wet. The mother says it's not something that happens often and was due to a stressful day and being busy with dinner. The husband claims she left it for 5 hours (which she says isn't true) and feels disrespected because he got covered in pee.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the mother was at fault. The key points here are: the child is 2.5, which is old enough that maybe she should be using the potty, but the mother is using pull-ups. The husband was wrestling with the child, and then the mother asked him to change the diaper. The husband got angry, threw/kicked something, and the mother left the room. The husband claims she left the diaper for 5 hours, but she denies it. The mother's excuse is a stressful day and being busy with dinner.\n\nNow, the question is whether the mother is in the wrong. On one hand, not changing a child's diaper for an extended period could be considered neglectful, especially if it's not typical. However, the mother says this is an exception due to the stressful day. The daughter is 2.5, so maybe she should be potty-trained, but sometimes kids have accidents. The fact that it's a one-time thing and not a pattern might be important. The husband's reaction seems extreme\u2014getting angry about a wet diaper and being covered in pee. The mother tried to explain herself but was cut off. The husband's behavior of throwing/kicking things and yelling adds to the conflict. \n\nThe mother's actions might not be in the wrong because it was an oversight, not intentional neglect. The husband's reaction seems more about the situation and maybe his own stress. The mother also left the room to avoid arguing, which shows she tried to de-escalate the situation. The husband's claims about 5 hours might be exaggerated. \n\nBut maybe there's a cultural or societal expectation here. Some might say that as a parent, you shouldn't forget to change a diaper, even for a moment. However, since it's a 2.5-year-old, maybe the expectation is different than a baby. Also, the mother was in the middle of making dinner, which is a common multitasking scenario for parents. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband might feel like the mother was negligent, especially if the child was uncomfortable. But the mother's intention wasn't to harm or neglect the child. The husband's reaction seems more about the mess and the disrespect he felt, which could be a miscommunication. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the mother's mistake was an oversight, not intentional. The husband's response was perhaps overly harsh and escalated the situation. The mother tried to handle it by asking him to change the diaper, which shows she's trying to share responsibilities. The fact that this is an isolated incident and not a pattern supports the idea that she's not at fault. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
