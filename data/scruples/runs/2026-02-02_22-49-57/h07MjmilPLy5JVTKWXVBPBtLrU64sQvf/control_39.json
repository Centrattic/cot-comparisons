Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (who is a parent) is in the wrong for not changing their daughter's diaper. The daughter is 2.5 years old and was in a pull-up that doesn't hold as much. The parent forgot to change her, and when she asked her husband to do it, he got upset. The husband claims it was disrespectful and that the diaper was full for 5 hours, but the author says that's not true. The situation happened once due to a stressful day.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author's action was wrong. At 2.5 years old, a child is typically in training pants, so the parent might be working on potty training. The author forgot to change her, but it's a one-time occurrence due to a stressful day. The husband's reaction seems exaggerated\u2014yelling, kicking things, being angry about being covered in pee. The parent tried to explain but was cut off. The author left the room to avoid arguing.\n\nThe key points here are: the author didn't intentionally neglect, it's a rare slip-up, and the husband's reaction seems over-the-top. There's no mention of harm to the child beyond the diaper being wet. The author was in the middle of making dinner when she realized the mistake. Since the daughter is used to regular changes, this was an exception. The husband's claim of 5 hours might be inaccurate, and the author didn't mean to disrespect the husband. The husband's anger seems more about the argument than the actual incident. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for a one-time mistake under stress. The husband's overreaction is the issue here. The answer should be B (No).\n"
