Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not changing their 2.5-year-old daughter's diaper. The situation is that the mother forgot, asked the husband to do it, and he got angry, even throwing or kicking something. The daughter was in a pull-up that doesn't hold much. The husband claims it was left for 5 hours, but the mother says that's not true. She was making dinner and had a stressful day.\n\nFirst, the child is 2.5 years old. At that age, it's common for them to be in training pants (pull-ups) as they're transitioning to using the potty. Forgetting to change a diaper is understandable, especially if the mother was busy with dinner. She did realize it and asked her husband for help. The husband's reaction seems exaggerated. He got angry, kicked something, and made a big deal about being covered in pee. The mother felt he was yelling, but he says he wasn't. \n\nThe key points here: Did the mother do something wrong? She forgot once in a non-recurring situation. She was handling dinner, which is a valid reason given the context. The husband's reaction seems out of proportion. The mother didn't intentionally neglect the child; it was an oversight. The husband's claim about 5 hours is disputed, and the mother's explanation is that it was a stressful day. \n\nAlso, the husband was wrestling with the child before, which might have made the situation more chaotic. The mother tried to explain herself but was cut off. The husband's anger over a minor incident and the physical reaction (kicking something) suggests he might be overreacting. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parents share in child-rearing. The mother did ask for help, so she wasn't avoiding responsibility. The husband's response was harsh and possibly disrespectful towards her. The mother left to avoid arguing, which shows she's trying to de-escalate the conflict. \n\nSo, considering all that, the mother isn't in the wrong. The husband's reaction is the issue here. The answer should be B, No.\n"
