Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about not changing a daughter's diaper when her husband ended up having to do it later and got upset. \n\nFirst, the daughter is 2.5 years old, so still using pull-ups. The author was in the middle of making dinner when the husband got home. The author forgot to change the diaper, and the husband ended up doing it. He got angry, saying she didn't have an excuse, and there was some yelling. The author says it's not a normal occurrence and that the day was stressful.\n\nI need to consider the context. The author didn't neglect the child on purpose. She was preoccupied with dinner and had a stressful day. The husband was asked to change the diaper, but he reacted angrily. The author left the room to avoid arguing. The husband claims it was disrespectful, but the author didn't mean to be. \n\nThe key points here are intent and frequency. The author didn't make a habit of this. It was a one-time mistake due to being busy. The husband's reaction seems harsh, especially since he was wrestling with the child before. Maybe he felt it was his responsibility now, but the author had been handling it regularly. \n\nAlso, the husband's claim that she left it for 5 hours might be an exaggeration. The author didn't have the time to change it when she realized, so she asked her husband. The fact that the clothes were a little wet might not be a big issue, but the husband's reaction seems overblown. \n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author isn't in the wrong, which I can agree with. It's a mistake made under stress, not neglect. The husband's anger and the accusation of disrespect might be unwarranted. So the answer should be B.\n"
