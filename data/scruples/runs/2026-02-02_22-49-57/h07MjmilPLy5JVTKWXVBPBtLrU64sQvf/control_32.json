Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a mother forgetting to change her daughter's diaper, which led to some conflict with her husband.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 2.5 years old, and she's in a pull-up that doesn't hold as much urine. The mother was making dinner when her husband got home. She forgot to change the diaper, and when she realized, she asked her husband to do it. He did, but after that, he got angry and kicked something. The mother felt he was yelling, but he says he wasn't. The husband claims she left the diaper for 5 hours, which she says isn't true. The mother left the room to avoid an argument. The background is that this is a rare occurrence due to a stressful day, and the diaper is usually changed regularly.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the mother forgot once, it's not a regular issue, the diaper was in a pull-up which might not be as effective, and the husband's reaction seems disproportionate. The mother did ask her husband to help when she realized the mistake, which shows she took responsibility. The husband, on the other hand, got angry and escalated the situation. His claims about the time being 5 hours might not be accurate, and his reaction of yelling and kicking things could be the real issue here.\n\nConsidering all that, the mother made a mistake but it's a one-time thing under stress. She took responsibility by asking her partner to help. The husband's response seems harsh, especially if the time frame he mentioned isn't accurate. The mother left to avoid conflict, which is understandable. So, the main problem seems to be the husband's overreaction rather than the mother's single lapse. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong here.\n"
