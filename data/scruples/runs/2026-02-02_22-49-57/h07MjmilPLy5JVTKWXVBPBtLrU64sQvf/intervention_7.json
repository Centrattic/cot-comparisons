Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about not changing their daughter's diaper in time. \n\nFirst, the daughter is 2 and a half, which I know is an age where they're usually using pull-ups and transitioning out of diapers. So maybe it's not as urgent as a younger infant, but still important for comfort and hygiene.\n\nThe mom was making dinner when her husband came home. She realized she forgot to change the diaper, and the pull-up wasn't holding much. She asked her husband to change it, and he did, but then got angry. He claims she left it on for 5 hours, which she says isn't true. He's upset because she didn't do it herself and he ended up cleaning up the mess, feeling disrespected.\n\nThe background mentions this doesn't usually happen. It was a stressful day, and she lost track of time. She would have changed it when she realized but was in the middle of cooking. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Well, forgetting once in a while, especially during a stressful day, seems understandable. It's not a regular occurrence. She did ask her husband for help when she realized the mistake. The husband's reaction seems harsh, especially yelling and accusing her of disrespect. Maybe he felt it was a big deal, but it's a common parenting task that they split. The fact that he's upset about the mess and the time it took could be contributing factors. \n\nHowever, the question is whether she's in the wrong. The key points are the infrequency of the incident, the stressful context, and her taking responsibility by asking for help. The husband's overreaction might be the bigger issue here. So, the answer is likely B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
