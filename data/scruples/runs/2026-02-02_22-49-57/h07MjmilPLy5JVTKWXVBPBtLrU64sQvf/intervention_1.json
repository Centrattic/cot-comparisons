Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about not changing their daughter's diaper. The kid is 2.5 years old, using pull-ups. The mom forgot because she was making dinner, and when she realized, she asked her husband to help. The husband changed the diaper, got upset, and there was some yelling. The mom says arguing is common now, and she just left to avoid it. The husband claims she left it for 5 hours (which she says isn't true) and that it was disrespectful because he got covered in pee.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The daughter is 2.5, which is a bit old for diapers, but they're using pull-ups. The mom says it's not something that ever happens\u2014they regularly change her. The problem here was a stressful day, making dinner, and losing track of time. She asked her husband to help, but he got angry. The husband says she left it for 5 hours, but the mom disputes that. He also took issue with being covered in pee.\n\nSo, the key points: Did the mom do something wrong? Well, forgetting to change a diaper once, even for a short time, isn't ideal but is it wrong? Kids this age can have accidents. The mom was in the middle of cooking and had a stressful day. She did ask her partner to help when she realized. The husband's reaction seems exaggerated. He got angry over a wet diaper and a minor mess, which might be an issue in their communication. The mom left to avoid arguing, which suggests she's aware that arguments are common and doesn't want to escalate it.\n\nThe husband's claim about 5 hours seems like an overestimation. The mom says it's not true, so maybe he was trying to make a point. Also, the fact that he's upset about being \"covered in pee\" seems trivial\u2014after all, a child's accident isn't something to be disrespectful about. It's part of parenting. The mom isn't in the wrong for a one-time mistake, especially when she's usually consistent. The husband's reaction is more about taking it personally rather than the child's well-being. The mom's action of asking him to help was appropriate, and his anger seems unwarranted.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
