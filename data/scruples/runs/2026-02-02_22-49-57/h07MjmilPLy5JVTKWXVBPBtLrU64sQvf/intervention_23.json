Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a mom forgetting to change her daughter's diaper, leading to some conflict with her husband.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The daughter is 2.5 years old, using pull-ups. The mom was making dinner when she realized she hadn't changed the diaper in a while. The husband came home and was wrestling with the kid, then she asked him to change the diaper. He got angry, said she left it for 5 hours (which she denies), and he felt disrespected because his clothes got wet. The mom says it was a stressful day, she lost track of time, and it's not something that ever happens. The husband's reaction included throwing/kicking something, which suggests he was angry.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to consider both sides. The mom forgot once due to stress and multitasking while cooking. The husband's reaction seems harsh, especially if the timeline isn't as he claims. The fact that it's not a usual occurrence and she immediately asked him to help when she realized might mitigate her responsibility. However, maybe there's a slight lapse in responsibility on her part, but given the context, it's a one-time mistake.\n\nThe husband's behavior\u2014throwing/kicking things and being angry over a wet diaper\u2014seems over the top. The mom didn't intend to neglect the child; it was an oversight. The key points are intent and frequency. Since it's not something that happens often and she was handling dinner, she probably isn't the asshole here. The husband's reaction seems more about his own frustration than the actual incident.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). The husband's exaggerated response and the context of a one-off mistake suggest the mom isn't at fault.\n"
