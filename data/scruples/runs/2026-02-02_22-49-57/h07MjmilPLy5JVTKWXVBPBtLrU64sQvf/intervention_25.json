Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent forgetting to change their 2.5-year-old daughter's diaper, which led to some conflict with her husband.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The daughter is using pull-ups, which aren't as absorbent as regular diapers. The mother realized she hadn't changed the diaper in a while, maybe because she was busy making dinner. She asked her husband to change it after he got home from work. He helped, but then got angry, saying she left it too long. The husband claims it was for 5 hours and that he was covered in pee. The mother says it wasn't that long and that she was stressed. She left the room because arguing is common and she didn't want to be yelled at.\n\nNow, the question is whether the mother is at fault. The user thinks she's not wrong. Let me break it down. The key points are: Did she neglect the child? Was the husband's reaction disproportionate? Is it reasonable to forget a diaper change once in a stressful day?\n\nThe child is 2.5 years old, which is old enough that leaving a soiled diaper on for a while could be uncomfortable, but the mother says it's not something that ever happens. The husband's anger seems intense. He claims she left it for 5 hours, but the mother disputes that. The husband got covered in pee because the clothes were wet, which he found disrespectful. That part is a bit odd because the mother didn't know the clothes were wet when she asked him to change the diaper. Maybe she didn't realize the pull-up was that full. \n\nThe mother was in the middle of making dinner when she realized the mistake. She asked her husband to handle it, which is a reasonable request. The husband helped but then became angry. His reaction might be more about being upset with her for the oversight rather than the child's well-being. The mother left because she didn't want to argue, which suggests she's trying to avoid conflict. \n\nIn general, parents can have stressful days and slip-ups happen. Forgetting a diaper change once, even if it leads to some mess, doesn't necessarily make someone a bad parent. The husband's response seems harsh, especially since it's not a recurring issue. The mother isn't showing neglect; she's asking for help. The husband's claim about being disrespectful because he got covered in pee might be taking it personally, which is more about his own feelings than the child's needs. \n\nSo, considering all that, the mother isn't in the wrong. The husband's reaction is disproportionate, and the situation is a one-time error due to stress. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
