Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong for not changing their daughter's diaper.\n\nFirst, the situation: The daughter is 2.5 years old and was in a pull-up. The parent forgot to change her diaper while making dinner. The husband came home, and the parent asked him to change it. He did, got angry because the diaper was full and the kid's clothes were wet. The parent says it wasn't a regular thing and that the husband exaggerated the time (5 hours vs reality). The parent left because they don't want to argue anymore.\n\nSo, the key points here. The parent forgot once, it's not a recurring issue. The child uses pull-ups, which don't hold as much as regular diapers. The parent was busy making dinner. The husband got angry, but the parent didn't have any prior issues with this. The husband's reaction seems harsh, especially since it's a one-time mistake. Also, the parent tried to explain, but he cut them off and accused them of having no excuse. The parent left to avoid an argument.\n\nNow, considering the question: Is the author in the wrong? Well, forgetting once in a while is understandable, especially when stressed. The husband's reaction seems disproportionate. The parent was doing a task (making dinner) and realized the mistake. The husband's anger over a wet diaper and being covered in pee seems a bit much. Also, the parent is taking responsibility by asking him to help, but he reacted negatively. \n\nSo, the parent isn't at fault here. The husband's overreaction is more concerning. The author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
