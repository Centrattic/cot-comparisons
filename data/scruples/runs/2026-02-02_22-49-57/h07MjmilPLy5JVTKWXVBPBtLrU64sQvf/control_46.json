Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe user is a parent who forgot to change their 2.5-year-old daughter's diaper. The husband came home while the user was making dinner. The user mentioned that the daughter was in a pull-up that doesn't hold as much pee. After the husband wrestled with her, the user asked him to change the diaper. The husband did, but later got angry, saying she left the diaper for 5 hours and that her clothes were wet, which he thought was disrespectful because he ended up covered in pee. The user says arguing is common now and that they left because they didn't want to be yelled at. The background is that this is not a usual occurrence; the diaper is usually changed regularly. The user was stressed and lost track of time but would have changed it when they realized.\n\nSo the question is, is the author in the wrong? AITA (Am I the Asshole) usually depends on whether the person's actions were unreasonable or if they're being too harsh about the situation.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 2.5 years old. At that age, kids are typically transitioning out of diapers, so maybe the parent is still using pull-ups. The user forgot to change the diaper, which is understandable if they were preoccupied with dinner and a stressful day. They asked the husband to change it, which shows they were aware of the mistake and tried to delegate. The husband took over, but later reacted strongly by yelling and being angry. The user claims it wasn't 5 hours and that the husband was being unfair.\n\nThe husband's main points: 1) The diaper was left for too long (5 hours, but the user says it's not true). 2) The clothes were wet, so he felt it was disrespectful to him because he got covered in pee. Also, the husband was angry and cut off the user's explanation.\n\nThe user's defense: It was a one-time mistake due to stress. They realized the oversight and asked their husband to handle it. They left to avoid an argument.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, the key factors are intention and usual behavior. Since it's not a regular occurrence, a single lapse might be understandable. The user tried to correct the situation by asking the husband. However, leaving a young child in a dirty diaper for a long time can be uncomfortable for the child and may lead to hygiene issues. The user might be at fault for not changing it in a timely manner, but given the context of stress and that it's not usual, maybe it's a forgivable mistake.\n\nThe husband's reaction seems harsh. Yelling and being disrespectful is not okay, especially if the user was asking for help. The husband's claim of being \"covered in pee\" might be a stretch if the clothes were just a little wet. The user left to avoid the argument, which isn't healthy, but the husband's behavior also contributed to the conflict. \n\nSo, is the user in the wrong? They had a lapse in care, but under stress. The husband's overreaction might be the bigger issue here. The AITA usually looks at both sides, but the question is specifically about the author. If the user forgot once and immediately asked the husband to help, maybe they're not the asshole. The husband's accusation of 5 hours and disrespect might be exaggerated. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
