Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not changing their daughter's diaper. The daughter is 2.5 years old, using pull-ups, and the mother forgot to change her. The husband was home and she asked him to change it, but he got angry and threw something. She left the room because she didn't want to argue.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the mother is at fault. She says it was a stressful day and she lost track of time. The diaper wasn't changed for a while, but she didn't do it intentionally. The husband claims it was 5 hours, but she says that's not true. The daughter's clothes were wet, but the mother was making dinner. \n\nFrom a childcare perspective, 2.5-year-olds often transition out of diapers, but sometimes accidents happen. The mother didn't neglect the child intentionally. The husband's reaction seems harsh\u2014yelling, throwing things. The mother tried to explain but was cut off. Arguing is common in their relationship, so maybe the husband's response is part of a pattern.\n\nThe key points are intent and proportionality. The mother didn't intentionally leave the diaper on; she had a stressful day. The husband's reaction was over the top. The user is asking if the mother is wrong, but based on the info, she's not. The husband's anger seems unwarranted. So the answer is B (No).\n"
