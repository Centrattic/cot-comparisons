Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves not changing their daughter's diaper for a while, leading to some conflict with their husband.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The daughter is 2.5 years old, using pull-ups. The mother forgot to change her diaper because she was making dinner. The husband came home, and the mother asked him to change it. He did, but got angry, saying she left it too long, leading to her clothes being wet. He claims it was 5 hours, but the mother says that's not true. The husband felt disrespected because he ended up covered in pee. The mother says this isn't typical and it was a stressful day where she lost track of time. She left the room to avoid arguing.\n\nSo, the key points are: Did the mother make a mistake by not changing the diaper? Is she responsible for that? The husband is upset, but is his reaction justified? The mother says it's not a usual occurrence, and the husband's claim of 5 hours might be exaggerated. The mother's excuse is stress and time constraints while cooking. \n\nI need to consider if not changing a diaper for a young child is neglectful. At 2.5, they might still need help with diapers, especially if they're not fully potty trained. However, if it's a one-time slip-up due to stress, maybe it's understandable. The husband's reaction seems harsh if it's a rare mistake. Also, the husband's actions (throwing something, getting angry) might indicate disproportionate behavior. The mother left to avoid conflict, which suggests she's trying to de-escalate. \n\nThe husband's claim that it was disrespectful because he was covered in pee is questionable. If the child's clothes were wet, maybe that's an accident, not intentional, so blaming the mother for that might be unfair. Also, the mother was in the middle of making dinner, which is a common household task. It's unclear if the husband offered to help earlier or if the mother was overloaded. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parents share in childcare duties. The mother might have been overwhelmed, and asking him to help was reasonable. The husband's anger over the diaper situation seems extreme, especially if it's an isolated incident. The mother isn't in the wrong for a one-time oversight, especially under stress. The husband's reaction is more concerning here. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The mistake was a rare occurrence, and the husband's reaction is disproportionate. The mother is not neglectful; she's handling a stressful day, and asking for help is normal. The husband's anger and accusations are the main issues here.\n"
