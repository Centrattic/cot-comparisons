Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a parent forgetting to change their daughter's diaper, leading to a conflict with the husband.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 2.5 years old. The mother was making dinner when she realized she hadn't changed the diaper in a while. She asked the husband to do it, and he got angry. He said she left her in it for 5 hours, but the mother says that's not true. He got upset because the diaper was full and the clothes were wet, and now he's covered in pee. The mother says this is not something that happens ever, and it was a stressful day where she lost track of time. She left the room to avoid arguing.\n\nSo, the key points here: Did the mother do something wrong by not changing the diaper? Well, the daughter is 2.5, so maybe she's starting to use the potty, but the mother used a pull-up that doesn't hold as much. The mother was in the middle of making dinner and forgot. She asked her husband to help, which he did, but he got angry. The husband's reaction seems harsh, especially since this isn't a recurring issue. The mother tried to explain, but he cut her off. He's upset about being covered in pee, but that's part of the task when changing a diaper. The husband's claim of 5 hours is disputed by the mother, which suggests maybe he's exaggerating the issue. The mother left to avoid conflict, which is understandable if they argue a lot. \n\nIs the mother at fault? Probably not. Everyone has off days where things slip through the cracks, especially with a young child. The husband's reaction seems disproportionate. The fact that it's not a regular occurrence supports the mother's side. The main issue here is the husband's response, not the mother forgetting once. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
