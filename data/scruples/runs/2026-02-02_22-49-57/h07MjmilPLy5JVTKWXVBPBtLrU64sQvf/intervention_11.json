Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not changing their daughter's diaper. The situation involves a 2.5-year-old in a pull-up, which isn't holding as much as a regular diaper. The husband was wrestling with the daughter before the author asked him to change the diaper. He got angry, threw something, and the author left the room to avoid arguing. The author claims it wasn't a regular occurrence and that the husband exaggerated the time the diaper was left on.\n\nFirst, the key points here are about responsibility and communication. The author forgot to change the diaper, which is understandable given the stress of the day and being busy with dinner. However, the child is 2.5 and using pull-ups, which suggests she might be potty training. At that age, it's possible she could go longer between changes, but it's still the parent's responsibility to ensure comfort and hygiene. The author did realize the mistake and asked the husband to help, which shows they tried to address it immediately. \n\nThen there's the husband's reaction. He got angry, threw something, and accused the author of leaving the diaper unchanged for 5 hours. The author denies this and mentions that the husband misinterpreted the situation, maybe being disrespectful by blaming the author. The fact that the husband reacted so strongly, even if the situation wasn't the worst, might indicate that he's handling the stress or frustration differently. The author left to avoid arguing, which is a common reaction in tense situations.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for forgetting once, especially since it's not a recurring issue. The stress of the day and being in the middle of cooking could contribute to losing track of time. The husband's response seems excessive, given that the child's clothes were slightly wet but not a major mess. The real issue here might be communication and handling stress rather than the act of forgetting itself. So, the author's mistake was a one-time oversight, and the husband's reaction is more about how he handled it. Therefore, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
