Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not changing their daughter's diaper. The situation involves a husband and wife, with the husband getting upset because the wife forgot to change their 2.5-year-old's diaper, leading to some mess and a confrontation.\n\nFirst, the key points: The daughter is 2.5 years old, using pull-ups which don't hold as much. The wife forgot to change the diaper, possibly because of a stressful day while making dinner. The husband came home, wrestled with the kid, and she ended up wet. The wife asked him to change the diaper, he did but got angry, claiming she left it for 5 hours (which she denies). He was upset about the mess and felt disrespected. She left the room to avoid arguing.\n\nNow, evaluating who's in the wrong. The wife forgot once, which isn't a recurring issue. She was busy with dinner and a stressful day. The husband's reaction seems excessive. Throwing or kicking something suggests anger. He cut her off when she tried to explain, which is poor communication. The husband's claim of 5 hours might be an exaggeration. The wife didn't intentionally neglect the child, and it's a one-time slip-up. The husband's reaction of yelling and being disrespectful points to his possible fault in overreacting. The fact that arguments are common between them adds context to the tension.\n\nSo, the wife isn't in the wrong for a single oversight, especially under stress. The husband's reaction seems more problematic. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
