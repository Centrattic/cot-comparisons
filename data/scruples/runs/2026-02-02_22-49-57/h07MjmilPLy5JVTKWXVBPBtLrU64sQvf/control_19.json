Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not changing their daughter's diaper, leading to an argument with their husband.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 2.5 years old and using pull-ups. The mother forgot to change her diaper because she was making dinner. The husband came home and changed her, but then got angry. He claims she left her in it for 5 hours, which she says isn't true. The husband was upset because her clothes were wet and he felt disrespected. The mother says it was a stressful day and she lost track of time.\n\nSo, is the mother at fault? Well, 2.5-year-olds usually don't need diapers all day. They should be potty trained or at least using pull-ups with regular checks. Forgetting once might happen, especially if it's a stressful day. The husband's reaction seems a bit over the top. Throwing or kicking something in anger isn't great, and yelling vs. not yelling is a point of contention. The mother didn't neglect the child intentionally; it was a slip-up. The husband's accusation of 5 hours might be an exaggeration. Also, she was in the middle of making dinner, which could be a valid reason for not noticing. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband helped by changing the diaper, so maybe he was just frustrated. But his reaction (anger, accusing her of disrespect) might be disproportionate. The mother didn't mean to cause a mess or make him uncomfortable. So, considering all that, the answer is probably B (not in the wrong). The husband's reaction is more of an issue here.\n"
