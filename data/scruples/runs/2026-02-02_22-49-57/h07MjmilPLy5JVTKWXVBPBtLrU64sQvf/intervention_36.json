Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent who forgot to change their 2.5-year-old daughter's diaper is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband came home while the parent was making dinner, and they asked him to change the diaper. The husband was angry, claiming she left it for 5 hours and that it was disrespectful because he was covered in pee when her clothes were wet. The user feels the parent isn't at fault because it's not something that happens often and was due to a stressful day.\n\nFirst, considering the child's age, 2.5 years is a time when many kids are already in pull-ups and working on potty training. The parent mentions that this is not the norm and it was a stressful day leading to a lapse in memory. The husband's reaction seems disproportionate\u2014yelling (or perceiving it as such) over a diaper that was missed once. The parent was in the middle of cooking, which is a common task that can be stressful, especially if they're tired or dealing with other responsibilities. \n\nThe husband's claim of 5 hours might be an exaggeration. If the parent realized the oversight and asked him to help right after he got home, the actual time the diaper was on could be much less. Also, the husband wrestling with the child just before could have been a time when the parent was occupied, but the parent did ask him to change the diaper as soon as possible. The fact that the husband took the child to the shower instead of just changing the diaper might have made the situation worse, and the parent left because they didn't want to argue. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parents should be sharing the duties, especially with a young child. The parent asking for help isn't wrong. The husband's anger over a single missed diaper change, especially if it's rare, might stem from stress or other issues in their relationship. The parent not being in the wrong here (option B) makes sense because occasional oversights happen, and the reaction seems excessive. The husband's claim of disrespect due to being covered in pee is a bit odd since the parent's mistake isn't about the husband's cleanliness but the child's care.\n"
