Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about not changing their daughter's diaper. The daughter is 2.5 years old, and she was in a pull-up, which isn't as good at holding pee as a regular diaper. The husband came home while the author was making dinner. The author forgot to change the diaper and asked the husband to do it. He did, but got angry, saying the diaper was full and her clothes were wet. The author says it didn't happen often and it was a stressful day. The husband claims she left it for 5 hours and that it was disrespectful because he got covered in pee.\n\nFirst, the author didn't intentionally neglect the child. It was a forgetful moment during a busy, stressful day. The daughter is 2.5, so maybe she's transitioning out of diapers, but still needs attention. The husband's reaction seems a bit extreme, especially if the author usually handles it well. The husband's anger might be overblown, especially if the author was in the middle of cooking and only asked for help when she realized. The fact that the husband got angry and threw something (or kicked something) is a red flag. The author left the room to avoid an argument, which shows she's not trying to escalate things. The husband's accusation of disrespect because of the wet clothes seems harsh. Also, the author says he wasn't yelling, which contradicts her perception, but the husband's actions (throwing things) indicate he was angry regardless. So, the author isn't at fault here. The problem is more about the husband's reaction and communication style. So, answer B.\n"
