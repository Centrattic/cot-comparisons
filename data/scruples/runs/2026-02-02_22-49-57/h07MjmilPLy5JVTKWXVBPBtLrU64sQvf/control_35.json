Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent forgetting to change their 2.5-year-old daughter's diaper, and the husband getting angry about it. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. The daughter is 2.5, which is old for a diaper, but she's in a pull-up. The parent was making dinner when she realized she forgot to change it. The husband had been wrestling with her before and was asked to change the diaper. He did, then got angry, saying she left it on for 5 hours and that it was disrespectful because he was covered in pee.\n\nThe key points here: the parent usually changes the diaper regularly, but this was a stressful day and she lost track of time. The husband's actions might be overreacting. The parent didn't intend to leave it on for long; she was just busy. The husband's claim of 5 hours seems exaggerated if she only forgot while making dinner. Also, the parent left because they didn't want to argue, which suggests they're not trying to be a jerk but are dealing with stress.\n\nSo, the question is whether the parent is at fault. Since it's a one-time mistake due to stress and not a regular occurrence, the parent isn't negligent. The husband's reaction is harsh, especially if the time was less than 5 hours. The parent asked him to help, which is a reasonable request. The husband's anger and the accusation of disrespect might be unwarranted. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. The husband's overreaction and misrepresenting the time frame seem to be the main issues here. The parent made a mistake under stress, but it's not something they usually do, and the husband's response is unreasonable.\n"
