Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is at fault here. The situation is about not changing their daughter's diaper. The daughter is 2.5 years old, so maybe she's supposed to be using training pants? The parent says they forgot to change her diaper because they were making dinner. The husband got home, the kid was in a pull-up that doesn't hold much pee. The parent asked the husband to change the diaper, but he was upset about it later.\n\nFirst, the parent admits they forgot, but says it's because of a stressful day and they were cooking. They clarify it's not a regular thing. The husband says she left the diaper for 5 hours (which she denies), and he was angry because he got covered in pee. He says it was disrespectful. The parent left to avoid an argument.\n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? Well, changing a child's diaper is a shared responsibility. The parent asked the husband to do it, which is normal. The husband was angry about the situation, but maybe his reaction was over the top. The parent didn't intentionally neglect the child; it was a mistake. The husband's claim of 5 hours might be exaggerated. The parent is taking responsibility for forgetting, but the husband's response seems harsh. \n\nThe key points are that this is an isolated incident, not a pattern. The parent was busy with dinner, and the child was in a less absorbent pull-up. The husband's anger led to conflict. Since the parent is apologizing and explaining, and the husband's reaction is more about his own feelings than the child's well-being (since she was eventually cleaned), the parent isn't necessarily at fault. The husband's overreaction might be the bigger issue here. So, probably answer B, the author isn't the asshole.\n"
