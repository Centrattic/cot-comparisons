Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not changing their 2.5-year-old daughter's diaper, leading to a conflict with her husband.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 2.5 years old. At that age, kids are usually in pull-ups and transitioning to potty training. So, maybe the need for frequent diaper changes is less critical than with infants. The author forgot to change the diaper because she was busy making dinner. The husband was home and asked if he could help, but he ended up upset because the diaper was full and the clothes were wet. He claims she left it for 5 hours, which she denies.\n\nThe key points here: Did the author neglect the child's needs? Well, the child was in a pull-up, which doesn't hold as much as a regular diaper, but the author might have known she needed a change. However, it's mentioned that this is an unusual occurrence and not a regular habit. The stress of the day caused her to lose track of time. Also, the husband's reaction seems a bit over the top\u2014yelling, throwing things, and feeling disrespected because he got covered in pee. The author left because they argue a lot now and she didn't want to escalate it.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was wrong. Neglecting a child's hygiene is a concern, but if it's a one-time mistake and the child's regular routine is good, maybe it's not the author's fault. The husband's reaction might be the issue here, being overly critical and aggressive. The author's intention wasn't to be disrespectful, just an oversight due to stress. Also, the husband was wrestling with the child beforehand, which might have contributed to her needing a change sooner. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parents should help with childcare. The author asked the husband to help, but he might have been busy. The real problem seems to be the husband's reaction rather than the author forgetting once. Since it's not a recurring issue, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. So, the answer would be B, No.\n"
