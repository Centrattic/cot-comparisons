Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not changing their daughter's diaper. The situation is that the husband got home, they were making dinner, and the daughter was in a pull-up. The mother forgot to change her diaper, which led to the daughter peeing and getting wet. The husband took over, got angry, and they had an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the mother was wrong. The daughter is 2.5 years old, so she's using pull-ups, which are more for potty training. The mother says she forgot, and it's not a usual occurrence. She was making dinner and had been busy. The husband claims she left it for 5 hours, but she says that's not true. He was upset because he ended up getting pee on him when changing her.\n\nFrom the information given, the mother's forgetfulness seems to be a one-time mistake, not a pattern. She realized the mistake and asked her husband to help, which shows she tried to correct it. The husband's reaction seems excessive, especially since the mother wasn't intentionally neglecting the child. He's angry about the mess and being upset, but the mother's priority was cooking dinner, which is a common household task.\n\nThe husband's claim that it's disrespectful is questionable. The mother was managing multiple tasks and made an honest mistake. The fact that this is not a recurring issue supports her point. Also, the husband's reaction of getting angry and yelling, versus the mother's quiet exit to avoid conflict, indicates that the problem might be more about the husband's reaction than the mother's actions.\n\nSo, the mother isn't in the wrong here. She made a mistake, but it wasn't intentional or habitual. The husband's response is more concerning. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
