Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not changing their daughter's diaper. The situation is that the mom forgot to change her 2.5-year-old's diaper, and the dad got angry when he found out and changed it. The mom is asking if she's the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The daughter is using pull-ups, which don't hold as much as regular diapers. The mom says she realized she forgot to change the diaper after her husband came home and they were wrestling. She asked him to change it, and he did, but got angry because the diaper was full and the clothes were wet. The mom mentions it's not something that usually happens; it was a stressful day, and she was making dinner when she lost track of time. The husband claims it was 5 hours, but the mom says that's not true, and he's upset because he felt covered in pee.\n\nNow, evaluating if the mom is in the wrong. The key points are: Did she intentionally neglect the diaper? The story says she forgot due to a stressful day and was busy cooking. That's a common situation\u2014stress and multitasking can lead to oversights. The daughter is 2.5, so she might be in the process of potty training, but still needing occasional diaper changes. The mom didn't ignore it on purpose; she realized the mistake and asked her husband to help. The husband's reaction seems harsh, especially if the duration was less than 5 hours. Also, the husband wrestling with the child shortly before might have made the situation more urgent, but the mom did ask him to change it once she realized.\n\nThe husband's anger could be excessive, especially if the mom didn't do it on purpose. The fact that this is an isolated incident and not something that happens regularly supports the mom not being at fault. The husband's claim that it's disrespectful because he was covered in pee might not be a valid reason for anger if the mom was unaware. The mom left the situation to avoid arguing, which might indicate she felt defensive but didn't want to escalate things.\n\nOn the other hand, as a parent, ensuring a child's hygiene is important. However, the context of a busy, stressful day with an oversight that's not habitual suggests it's a mistake, not negligence. The husband's overreaction might be the bigger issue here. The mom's responsibility is shared with the husband, especially since he was home and wrestling with the child. He could have checked the diaper earlier too.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the mom isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
