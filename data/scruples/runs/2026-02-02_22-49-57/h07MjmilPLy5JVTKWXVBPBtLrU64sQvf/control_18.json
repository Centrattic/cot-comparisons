Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe mom forgot to change her 2.5-year-old daughter's diaper. She was making dinner when her husband got home. He had been wrestling with the kid before, and when she asked him to change the diaper, he did. But then he got angry, saying she left it for 5 hours and that the diaper was full, leading to some mess. The mom says it was a stressful day and she lost track of time while cooking. She didn't argue because she didn't want to fight, but the husband claims she was disrespectful.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the mom did something wrong. Forgetting to change a diaper once, especially if it's not a regular occurrence, might be a minor oversight. Stressful days can lead to such lapses. However, the daughter is 2.5 years old. At that age, many kids are potty training or using pull-ups. The mom might have been in the middle of cooking, which is a common task that requires attention. She asked the husband to help, which shows she's trying to delegate. \n\nThe husband's reaction seems harsh. He got angry, threw something, and later claims she left it for 5 hours, which she disputes. His anger over a wet diaper and being \"covered in pee\" seems excessive. Maybe he felt the mess was his responsibility, but that's not entirely fair. Parents often help each other out, and this seems like a normal part of parenting where mistakes can happen. \n\nThe key points here are: the mom forgot once in an otherwise routine, the husband's overreaction, and the context of a stressful day. The mom didn't ignore the child's needs regularly, just once. The husband's behavior (throwing things, yelling) is more problematic than the mom's oversight. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. The mistake was a one-time thing due to stress, and the husband's reaction is the bigger issue here.\n"
