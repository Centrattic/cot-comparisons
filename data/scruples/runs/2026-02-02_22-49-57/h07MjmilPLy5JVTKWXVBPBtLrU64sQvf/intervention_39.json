Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a parent forgetting to change their daughter's diaper, leading to some conflict with their husband.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 2.5 years old and in a pull-up. The parent was making dinner when they realized they forgot to change the diaper. They asked the husband to change it, but he got angry later when he found out. The husband claims she left it for 5 hours, but the parent says that's not true. The parent also mentions that this is a rare occurrence and that the day was particularly stressful.\n\nSo, I need to determine if the parent is at fault here. The key points are: Did the parent intentionally neglect the child? The parent admits to forgetting, which is a mistake, but not intentional neglect. The husband might be overreacting by accusing her of leaving it for 5 hours and being disrespectful by making him \"covered in pee.\" The parent also points out that they usually take good care of the child's needs and that this was an exception. \n\nThe husband's reaction seems harsh. Throwing or kicking something indicates anger, and cutting off the parent during an explanation isn't helpful. The parent left the room to avoid conflict, which might be a coping mechanism. \n\nConsidering all this, the parent made a mistake but it's not malicious. The husband's response might be disproportionate. Therefore, the answer is B, the parent is not in the wrong.\n"
