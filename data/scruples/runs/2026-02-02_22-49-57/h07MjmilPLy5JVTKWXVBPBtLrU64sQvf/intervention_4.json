Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves not changing their daughter's diaper for a while, leading to an argument with their husband.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 2.5 years old and was in a pull-up. The author forgot to change her diaper, possibly because they were busy making dinner. The husband offered to help after wrestling with the kid. He changed the diaper, got angry because it was full and her clothes were wet, and the author felt yelled at. The husband claims it was five hours, but the author disputes that. The background says this isn't usual, just a stressful day.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. Did they neglect the child? Probably not on purpose. They forgot due to a stressful day and being occupied with dinner. The husband was willing to help, so maybe the author could have done it themselves but asked him instead. However, the husband's reaction seems harsh, especially with the anger and yelling. The author left because they didn't want an argument. The key points are the stress, forgetfulness, and the husband's overreaction. The fact that this isn't a recurring issue suggests it was a one-time mistake. The husband's claim about five hours might be an exaggeration. The author wasn't neglectful; they just missed one time. So, the answer is B (No, not in the wrong).\n"
