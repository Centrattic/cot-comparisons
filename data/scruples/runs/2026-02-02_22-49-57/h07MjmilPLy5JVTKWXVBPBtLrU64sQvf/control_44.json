Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not changing their daughter's diaper. The situation is that the daughter is 2.5 years old and was in a pull-up. The author was making dinner when they realized they had forgotten to change the diaper. They asked their husband to do it, but he got angry, saying the diaper was really full and her clothes were wet. The husband claims it was disrespectful to him because he ended up covered in pee. The author argues that this isn't something that happens often and that it was a stressful day where they lost track of time. The husband says the diaper wasn't changed for 5 hours, but the author says that's not true. The author left the room to avoid arguing.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author made a mistake. Forgetting to change a diaper for a toddler in a pull-up might be a bit more forgiving since pull-ups are designed to handle some accidents. However, the key here is that the diaper was \"really full\" and the child's clothes were wet. That could be uncomfortable for the child and might lead to hygiene issues. The author was in the middle of making dinner, which is a valid task, but the child's needs should take priority. However, the author did ask their husband to help, so maybe they didn't intend to leave it unattended for long. \n\nThe husband's reaction seems a bit over the top. He got angry, threw or kicked something, and was yelling. He also accused the author of disrespect, which seems harsh. The fact that this is not a regular occurrence is important. Maybe the husband is stressed or has other issues causing him to overreact. The author tried to explain but was cut off. The husband's claim that it was disrespectful because he got covered in pee is a bit odd. The main concern should be the child's comfort and health, not the husband's mess.\n\nSo, looking at both sides: the author made a mistake but in an isolated incident due to a stressful day. The husband's reaction is disproportionate and aggressive. The author asking for help is reasonable. The husband's anger seems more about the situation than the actual issue. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. The main problem is the husband's handling of the situation. The answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
