Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a mom who forgot to change her 2.5-year-old daughter's diaper, leading to a conflict with her husband. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The daughter is using pull-ups, which don't hold as much pee. The mom mentions she forgot to change the diaper, but it's not a common occurrence. The husband asked to change the diaper, then later got angry, claiming she left it for 5 hours and that he was covered in pee. The mom left the room to avoid an argument, and the background context is a stressful day where she lost track of time.\n\nThe key points here are: the mom usually changes the diaper regularly, this was an exception due to stress and being occupied with dinner, and the husband's reaction seems exaggerated. The husband says he was angry and she had no excuse, but she says he was yelling, even if he claims he wasn't.\n\nNow, considering the question: Is the mom in the wrong? From a typical perspective, forgetting once, especially under stress, isn't necessarily wrong. However, the husband's reaction might be a bigger issue. The mom took responsibility by asking him to help, but he reacted angrily, which could indicate communication problems. The husband's claim about 5 hours seems off, as the mom says it's not true. \n\nIn such situations, the line between being forgetful and being neglectful is thin. Since the child is 2.5, they might be starting potty training, so maybe the mom was trying to manage that. The husband's anger over a minor incident (a little wetness) and getting covered in pee seems disproportionate. The mom left to avoid conflict, which is a valid choice if arguments are common.\n\nSo, the mom's mistake was forgetting, but it's a one-time slip. The husband's reaction seems more about the stress or maybe an underlying issue. Since the question is whether the author (the mom) is in the wrong, the answer is probably B (No), because the mistake was minor and she took responsibility, while the husband's reaction is the bigger problem.\n"
