Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about not changing their daughter's diaper, and their husband got upset about it. \n\nFirst, the daughter is 2.5 years old and was wearing a pull-up. The author forgot to change her diaper, and the husband ended up changing her, getting angry. The author says it's not something that usually happens, and they were stressed. The husband claims she left her in it for 5 hours, which the author denies. He's upset that his clothes got wet and feels disrespected.\n\nSo, is the author at fault? Well, the daughter is old enough that maybe she could go longer without a diaper change, but even with pull-ups, it's important to maintain hygiene. Forgetting to change a diaper might be a mistake, but the key points are that this isn't a recurring issue and the author was busy with dinner. However, the husband had to step in, which caused conflict. The husband's reaction seems harsh, especially if the author didn't intentionally neglect the child. The author might have been stressed and made an honest mistake. On the other hand, ensuring a child's needs are met is a parental responsibility, so maybe there's some accountability there. But since it's a one-time slip-up and not a pattern, the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong. The husband's overreaction and the specific claim about 5 hours being false also suggest the author isn't entirely at fault. So, the answer is B.\n"
