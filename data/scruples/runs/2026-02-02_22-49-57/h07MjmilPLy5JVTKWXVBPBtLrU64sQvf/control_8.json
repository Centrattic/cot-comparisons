Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not changing their daughter's diaper. The daughter is 2.5 years old, using pull-ups. The parent forgot to change the diaper, and the husband got angry when he had to deal with it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The parent was making dinner when the husband came home. The parent realized they forgot to change the diaper, so they asked the husband to do it. After that, the husband got angry, saying the diaper was really full and the clothes were wet. The parent says the husband was yelling, but he denies it. The parent also mentions that this is not a regular occurrence and that yesterday was a stressful day where they lost track of time. The husband claims it was 5 hours, which the parent disputes. The parent left the room to avoid an argument.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is at fault. The daughter is 2.5, so she's past the typical diaper-changing age but might still need occasional changes, especially with pull-ups. The parent forgot once, in a stressful time while cooking. They asked the spouse to help, which shows they recognized the mistake and tried to fix it. The husband's reaction seems harsh, especially if the parent didn't intentionally neglect the child. The parent is not in the wrong for a single oversight, especially when they corrected it by asking for help. The husband's anger and the escalation suggest he overreacted. The fact that this isn't a regular issue supports the parent's position. So, the answer is B (No).\n"
