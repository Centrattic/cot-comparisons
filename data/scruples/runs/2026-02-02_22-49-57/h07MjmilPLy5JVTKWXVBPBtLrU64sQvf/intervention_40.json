Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe scenario involves a couple and their 2.5-year-old daughter. The mother forgot to change her daughter's diaper while making dinner. The husband came home, and the mother asked him to change it. He did, but then he got angry, saying she left it for 5 hours and that she was disrespectful because he ended up covered in pee. The mother argues it wasn't that long and that it's not her usual behavior, attributing it to a stressful day.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the mother was wrong. Forgetting to change a child's diaper is common, especially with a busy schedule. The fact that it's not usual for her and she's usually consistent is a point in her favor. The husband's reaction seems harsh, particularly since he was the one who changed the diaper and then got angry. The mother was in the middle of making dinner, which is a valid reason for being distracted. The husband's claim of 5 hours might be exaggerated. Also, the mother left because she didn't want to argue, showing she's trying to avoid conflict, which isn't wrong.\n\nThe husband's anger over a wet diaper seems a bit over the top. Parents often help each other with tasks, and while it's reasonable to expect the diaper to be changed, the mother was handling dinner. The husband's reaction might stem from stress or other issues, not just the diaper incident. There's no indication the mother was neglectful; it was a one-time oversight. Therefore, the mother isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
