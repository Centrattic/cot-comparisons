Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not changing their daughter's diaper. The daughter is 2.5 years old, using pull-ups. The husband changed her after she asked, but he got angry. The woman says she forgot because it was a stressful day and was making dinner. The husband claims she left it for 5 hours, which she denies.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The key points are whether she was negligent, and if the husband's reaction was justified. She mentions this isn't usual, and it was a one-time mistake due to being busy. The husband's anger included yelling and throwing things, which is concerning. He also accused her of disrespect, but she didn't intentionally leave the diaper on. The daughter was in a pull-up, which might not be as effective as a regular diaper.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong. I should evaluate if forgetting once is a valid excuse. Since it's a rare occurrence and not part of her usual routine, it's understandable. The husband's reaction seems excessive, especially the physical outburst. The main issue is the husband's response, not the initial mistake. The woman did ask him to help, so she was trying to address it once she realized the mistake. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong here. The husband's behavior is the bigger problem. The mistake was minor and situational, and she took responsibility by asking for help.\n"
