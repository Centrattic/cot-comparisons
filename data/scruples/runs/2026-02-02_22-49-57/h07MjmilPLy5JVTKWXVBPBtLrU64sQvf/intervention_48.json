Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about a mom forgetting to change her daughter's diaper when she's 2.5 years old and using a pull-up. The husband gets home, she asks him to change the diaper, and he gets angry, saying she left it on for 5 hours and that she's disrespectful because he ended up getting wet. The mom says it's a stressful day, she was making dinner, and it's not something that usually happens.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the mom made a mistake. Forgetting to change a diaper for a toddler is a common oversight, especially when someone is busy with other tasks like cooking. The mom realized the mistake and asked her husband to help, which shows she's taking responsibility. The husband's reaction seems a bit over the top. He's upset about the diaper being full and her clothes being wet, but the mom claims it wasn't 5 hours and that it was a one-time stress-related slip. \n\nThe husband might feel that the mom didn't prioritize her daughter's needs, but the mom was handling dinner, which is a household responsibility. The fact that the husband was playing with the child before and then got upset might also be a point. Also, the mother didn't yell back and left to avoid argument, which suggests she's trying to maintain peace. The husband's claim about being disrespectful because he got covered in pee seems a bit harsh; the main issue is the child's comfort and hygiene, not him getting wet. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the mom isn't in the wrong for a one-time forgetfulness. The husband's anger seems disproportionate. The key factors are the frequency (this isn't usual), the mother's attempt to fix the situation, and the husband's overreaction. So the answer is B, the mom is not the asshole here.\n"
