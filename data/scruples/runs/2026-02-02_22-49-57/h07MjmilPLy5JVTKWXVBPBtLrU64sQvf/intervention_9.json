Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not changing their daughter's diaper. The situation is that the author forgot to change the diaper for their 2.5-year-old, who was in a pull-up. The husband helped change the diaper, got upset because the diaper was full and the child's clothes were wet, and then became angry. The author mentions it was a stressful day and they were making dinner, so they forgot. The husband claims it was 5 hours, which the author says isn't true, and he felt disrespected because he got pee on him.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is at fault. The key points are that this isn't a regular occurrence. The author usually changes the diaper regularly. The forgetfulness happened during a stressful day while cooking. The husband was angry, but the author didn't intentionally neglect the child. The child was in a pull-up, which might not be as effective as a regular diaper, so maybe the husband's reaction is a bit harsh. Also, the husband helped change the diaper, so he could have handled it without getting angry. The author tried to explain but was cut off. The husband's claim of 5 hours might be an exaggeration. The author left the situation to avoid an argument, which is understandable given their current dynamic where arguing is common.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband's reaction might be valid if he felt disrespected, but the situation seems to be a mistake rather than negligence. The author didn't mean to cause harm. Since the child is 2.5, they might be potty training, so using a pull-up is appropriate. The main issue is the husband's response versus the actual mistake. The author's forgetfulness was due to being busy and stressed, not neglect. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
