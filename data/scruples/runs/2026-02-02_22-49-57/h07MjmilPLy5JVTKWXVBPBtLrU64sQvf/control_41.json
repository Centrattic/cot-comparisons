Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about forgetting to change a 2.5-year-old's diaper. The daughter was in a pull-up, which doesn't hold as much as a regular diaper. The parent (the author) was busy making dinner when her husband came home. She asked him to change the diaper, but he got angry because it was full and the child's clothes were wet. The husband claimed she left it for 5 hours, which she says isn't true. The author mentions that this doesn't usually happen, and it was a stressful day where she lost track of time.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author was negligent. The child is 2.5, so ideally, she should be using the potty, but maybe she's still in pull-ups. The parent didn't change the diaper, leading to some mess. However, the parent did ask the husband to handle it, so maybe she wasn't avoiding responsibility but just distracted. The husband's reaction seems extreme\u2014kicking something, getting angry about being covered in pee, which might be his own reaction to the situation.\n\nThe key points are: the author forgot due to stress and time constraints, not neglect. The husband's anger might be about the stress of handling the mess rather than the child's well-being. The author didn't ignore the situation; she asked for help. The husband's claim of 5 hours might be inaccurate, and the author didn't intend to be disrespectful. Since this is an outlier event and not a pattern, the author isn't in the wrong. The husband's reaction seems overblown. So answer B.\n"
