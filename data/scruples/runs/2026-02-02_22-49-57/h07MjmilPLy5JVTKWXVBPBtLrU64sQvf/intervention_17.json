Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent forgetting to change their toddler's diaper, and the husband is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The author is a parent who forgot to change her daughter's diaper. The child is 2.5 years old and in a pull-up. The husband just got home and was wrestling with the daughter. The mom asked him to change the diaper, but when he did, he got angry because the diaper was full and the clothes were wet. The mom says it was a stressful day and she was making dinner, so she lost track of time. The husband claims it was for 5 hours and that it was disrespectful to him because he ended up covered in pee.\n\nThe key points here are whether forgetting once is the mom's fault and if the husband's reaction was disproportionate. The mom says this never happens, and the husband is overreacting. The question is whether the mom is in the wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nFrom my perspective, forgetting once, especially under stress, is understandable. Parents have busy lives and can make mistakes. The husband's reaction seems harsh. Yelling and getting angry over a one-time incident, especially when the mom didn't intend to neglect the child, might be the real issue. The husband's claim about it being 5 hours could be an exaggeration. Also, the mom's explanation about making dinner and stress is a valid reason for losing track of time.\n\nHowever, I should consider if the mom had a responsibility to ensure the diaper was changed. But since it's a one-time mistake and she realized it and asked for help, it's not negligence. The husband's reaction seems more about being upset with her for not handling it himself, maybe projecting his own stress. The mother's priority was making dinner, which is a common household task.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B. The mom isn't in the wrong because it was a one-time mistake, and the husband's reaction is excessive. The husband should be more understanding.\n"
