Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent (the author) is in the wrong for not changing their daughter's diaper. The situation involves a 2.5-year-old in a pull-up that leaked, leading to the husband changing her and becoming upset.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author forgot to change the diaper, but this isn't usual. The husband handled the situation by getting angry and kicking something, which the author heard. The husband claims she left the diaper for 5 hours, which she denies. The author was busy making dinner and had a stressful day. The husband felt disrespected because he was covered in pee after changing her.\n\nNow, considering the facts: The child is 2.5, so she might be in the process of potty training. Pull-ups are used for such cases. The author didn't intend to neglect; it was an oversight due to stress and being occupied. The husband's reaction seems harsh, especially if he's claiming a 5-hour duration, which might be inaccurate. The author leaving to avoid arguing suggests she didn't want to escalate the situation.\n\nPossible angles: Neglect vs. misunderstanding. The author's intention wasn't malicious, just a lapse. The husband's reaction involved anger and physical actions (kicking), which could indicate he's handling the situation poorly. The author's response to leave instead of arguing shows she's trying to de-escalate, which is a mature approach.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? It's a mistake, not intentional neglect. The husband's reaction seems disproportionate. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
