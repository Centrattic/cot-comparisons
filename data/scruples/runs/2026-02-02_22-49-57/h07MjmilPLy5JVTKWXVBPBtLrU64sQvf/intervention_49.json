Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a parent (the author) forgetting to change their 2.5-year-old daughter's diaper, which was in a pull-up that didn't hold well. The husband was home and asked to change her, but then the husband got angry and accused the author of leaving the diaper on for 5 hours, even though the author says that's not true. The author is asking if they're the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze who's at fault here. The key points are that this is not a regular occurrence\u2014usually, the diaper is changed regularly. The day was stressful, leading to a lapse in attention. The author was in the middle of making dinner and forgot. The husband was asked to help, but he reacted angrily, even claiming the diaper was on for 5 hours and that the author was disrespectful by making him deal with the mess.\n\nI think the main issue here is the husband's overreaction. Forgetting once in a stressful day doesn't make the parent an asshole. Parents are human and can have off days. The husband's response seems excessive, especially since the author didn't intentionally neglect the child. The husband's claim of 5 hours might be an exaggeration, which could be part of the problem. The author tried to explain but was cut off, leading to the argument.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The husband's reaction is the problem here. The answer should be B.\n"
