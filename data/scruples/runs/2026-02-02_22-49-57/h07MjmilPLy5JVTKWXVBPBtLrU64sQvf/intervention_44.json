Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about a parent forgetting to change their daughter's diaper. The daughter is 2.5 years old, using pull-ups, which don't hold as much. The husband comes home after wrestling with the daughter, and the mother asks him to change the diaper. He does, gets angry, and the mother feels attacked.\n\nFirst, the mother forgot to change the diaper, but it's noted that this doesn't usually happen. She was stressed and making dinner. The husband insists she left it for 5 hours, but she disputes that. He also claims she was disrespectful because he got covered in pee. The question is whether she's in the wrong.\n\nOn one hand, parents often get busy and make mistakes. Forgetting a diaper change once in a while, especially with a 2.5-year-old who's transitioning to pull-ups, could be understandable. The mother asked the husband to help, so she wasn't neglectful on purpose. The husband's reaction seems harsh\u2014yelling and getting angry over a single incident that doesn't happen regularly. \n\nOn the other hand, the daughter did end up with a full diaper and wet clothes, which could cause discomfort. However, the mother's intention was to take care of it once she realized, and she asked for help. The husband's anger and the exaggeration of the timeline (5 hours vs. her claim) might indicate overreaction.\n\nConsidering all factors, the mother made a mistake but not a malicious one. The husband's response seems disproportionate. So the answer is B.\n"
