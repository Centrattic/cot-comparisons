Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author here is in the wrong. So the situation is about a daughter who's 2.5 years old, using pull-ups. The parent (the author) forgot to change her diaper, and the husband ended up having to do it. The husband got angry, saying she left the diaper for 5 hours and that she was disrespectful by making him covered in pee. The author says the husband was yelling, but he denies it. The author mentions it's a stressful day and that this doesn't usually happen.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether not changing a diaper for a toddler is a serious issue. At 2.5 years old, they're usually going through potty training, so maybe the pull-up is a transitional phase. If the parent usually changes the diaper regularly, but forgot once because of a stressful day and being busy with dinner, that seems like a slip-up. The husband took the blame, but then got upset. \n\nThe key points here are: Did the author intentionally neglect the child? The author didn't mean to leave the diaper on long; it was an oversight. The husband exaggerated the time (5 hours might be an overstatement), which could be fueling the conflict. Also, the husband's reaction seems harsh. The author tried to explain but was cut off. The husband being \"covered in pee\" might be a minor issue compared to the emotional response. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parents sharing tasks is normal. The author asked the husband to help, which is reasonable. The husband's anger over a single incident, especially when it's an accident, might be overreacting. The author's apology and explanation might not have been accepted, leading to conflict. \n\nSo, the author isn't intentionally wrong here. It's a human error, especially under stress. The husband's reaction seems more problematic. The author might be in the right. Answer B.\n"
