Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a daughter who is 2.5 years old, wearing a pull-up that didn't hold much pee. The author forgot to change her diaper for a while, and the husband ended up changing it, getting upset about it. The key points here are the stress of the day, the author being in the middle of making dinner, and the husband's reaction.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that this is not something that happens often. The daughter's diaper is usually changed regularly. The author was having a stressful day and lost track of time. When she realized the mistake, she asked her husband to help, which he did, but then he became angry. The husband claims she left the diaper for 5 hours, which she denies. The argument is over a wet diaper and the husband feeling disrespected because he got covered in pee.\n\nI need to assess if the author is at fault. The main issue is forgetting to change the diaper. However, given that it's a rare occurrence and the author was busy making dinner, it's a common oversight. The husband's reaction seems harsh, especially since the author was trying to delegate the task. The fact that the husband got angry and accused her of disrespect might be more about his reaction than the actual situation. The author left it in her pull-up, which doesn't hold much, but the husband's claim of 5 hours might be exaggerated. Also, the author didn't intend to neglect the child; it was a slip-up due to stress.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parents share in childcare duties. The author didn't ignore the situation; she tried to correct it by asking her husband to help. The husband's anger over a minor incident and the accusation of disrespect seem excessive. The author's decision to leave the argument might be a result of their usual conflict patterns, but that doesn't make her wrong here.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. The mistake was unintentional and due to a stressful day, and the husband's reaction seems overblown. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
