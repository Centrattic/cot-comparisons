Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post (AITA = Am I the Asshole) is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent forgetting to change their daughter's diaper, leading to an argument with their husband.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The daughter is 2.5 years old, using pull-ups. The parent (the author) was making dinner when they realized they had forgotten to change the diaper. The husband had just been wrestling with the child and was asked to change the diaper. The husband got angry, threw something, later said he kicked something, and was upset about the mess. The author mentions it's not a usual occurrence and that the day was stressful, leading to losing track of time. The husband claims the diaper wasn't changed for 5 hours, but the author denies that. The husband felt it was disrespectful because he ended up covered in pee.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. But I need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, forgetting to change a diaper isn't something that happens often, and the author was in the middle of cooking. Stressful days can lead to lapses in memory. On the other hand, the husband felt disrespected and upset, which is valid if he felt that the author didn't take responsibility or consider his feelings. However, the husband's reaction (yelling, throwing/kicking things) seems excessive for the situation. The author tried to explain but was cut off, indicating possible communication issues.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, parents often share duties, but the key here is that the author forgot, not that they neglected it intentionally. The husband's reaction might stem from feeling that the author didn't prioritize the child's needs, but the situation seems to be a one-time mistake under stress. The husband's claim about the 5-hour duration being false might mean he's exaggerating the issue. The author's decision to leave during the argument could be seen as avoiding conflict, but it's also a way to prevent escalation.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for a single lapse in memory, especially given the context of a stressful day. The husband's overreaction and the way he handled the situation (yelling, physical actions) suggest he might be the one at fault. The author's intent wasn't to be disrespectful; it was an accident. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
