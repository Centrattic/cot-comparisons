Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not changing their daughter's diaper. The situation is that the author forgot to change the diaper for a few hours while making dinner, the husband changed it and got angry, saying she left it on for 5 hours. The author thinks she's not wrong, but wants to know others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The child is 2.5 years old, using pull-ups. The mother was in the middle of making dinner when she realized she forgot. She asked the husband to change the diaper, and he got upset because the diaper was full and the child's clothes were wet. The husband claims it was disrespectful because he got covered in pee. The author denies it was 5 hours and says it was a stressful day where she lost track of time.\n\nNow, considering if the author is wrong. From a parent's perspective, forgetting to change a diaper once in a while, especially with a young child, isn't necessarily negligence. The key points here: the child is regularly diaper-changed, this is an isolated incident due to a stressful day, and the mother was busy with dinner. The husband's reaction seems over the top, especially if the time frame was exaggerated. The mother taking responsibility by asking him to change it shows she's trying to fix the situation. The husband's anger over the mess and the accusation of disrespect might be the bigger issue here.\n\nBut maybe there's a cultural or personal expectation that parents shouldn't let a child stay in a dirty diaper for too long. However, given that the mother was cooking and the child is old enough to be in pull-ups, a few hours might be understandable. The husband's reaction of anger and yelling could be unhelpful. The author left because she didn't want to argue, which might indicate the husband's behavior is problematic.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the mother made a mistake but it's a common one. The husband's response seems excessive. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
