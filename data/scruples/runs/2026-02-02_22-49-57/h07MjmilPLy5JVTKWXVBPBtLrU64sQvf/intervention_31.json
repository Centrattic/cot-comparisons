Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent (the author) is in the wrong for not changing their daughter's diaper. The situation involves a 2.5-year-old in a pull-up, and the parent forgot to change it, leading to some wetness.\n\nFirst, the parent mentions that this isn't something that normally happens. They had a stressful day and lost track of time. When they realized the mistake, they asked their husband to help. The husband then got angry, saying she left it for 5 hours (which she denies) and felt disrespected because he got covered in pee when he changed her.\n\nI need to consider if the parent made a mistake here. Forgetting once in a stressful day isn't unusual. The key points are that the child is usually well-cared for, the parent tried to address it by asking the husband, and the husband's reaction was disproportionate. The husband's anger seems more about his own feelings (being upset about the mess) rather than the child's well-being. The parent also left the situation to avoid conflict, which is a common coping mechanism.\n\nThe husband's claim of 5 hours might be an exaggeration to make the situation seem worse. The parent's responsibility is there, but the context matters. It's a one-time slip-up, not a pattern. The husband's reaction of anger and yelling is more concerning because it's about how he felt rather than the child's needs.\n\nSo, the parent isn't in the wrong. The husband's overreaction and the context of stress make the parent not the asshole here. Answer B.\n"
