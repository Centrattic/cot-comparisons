Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about forgetting to change their daughter's diaper. The husband got angry, saying she left her in it for 5 hours, but she claims that's not true. The key points here are: the daughter is 2.5 years old, using a pull-up that doesn't hold as much. The mom was making dinner when she realized she forgot, then asked the husband to change the diaper after he wrestled with the kid. He got angry, threw something, and she left to avoid an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if forgetting the diaper is a valid oversight. The mom says it's not something that ever happens, and it was a particularly stressful day. Stress can make people forget things. The daughter was in a pull-up, which might be harder to detect when wet. The husband's reaction seems harsh\u2014kicking something, getting angry about being covered in pee. The mom was in the middle of making dinner, which is a valid task. She did ask him to change the diaper once she realized it. The husband's claim that it was 5 hours might be an exaggeration. The mom left because she didn't want to argue, which shows she's trying to avoid conflict.\n\nNow, is she in the wrong? Well, forgetting a diaper change is a mistake, but it's a common oversight, especially with a toddler. The fact that it doesn't happen often is important. The husband's reaction seems disproportionate. The mom tried to take responsibility by asking him to help, which is a good step. The husband's anger over being \"covered in pee\" seems more about his own discomfort than the child's well-being. The key here is whether the mistake was negligent. Since it's a one-time slip-up under stress, not a pattern, it's not her fault. The husband's response is more about his frustration than her actual wrongdoing. So the answer should be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
