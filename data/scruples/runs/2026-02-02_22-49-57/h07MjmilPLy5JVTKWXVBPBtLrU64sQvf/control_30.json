Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the mom forgot to change her 2.5-year-old daughter's diaper. She was making dinner when her husband got home. She asked him to change the diaper, and he did, but got angry because the diaper was really full and her clothes were wet. The mom says it wasn't her intention to leave it for 5 hours, and that it's not something that usually happens. She felt stressed and lost track of time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The child is 2.5, which is old enough that they might be in training pants (pull-ups) and should be able to communicate when they need to go. However, sometimes kids might not tell, especially if they're distracted or playing. The mom is in the middle of cooking, which is a common time when parents might get distracted. She did forget, but it's a one-time incident. The husband took it out on her, got angry, and even kicked something. The mom felt yelled at, even if he claims he wasn't. \n\nThe husband's reaction seems a bit over the top. Getting angry and throwing or kicking things over a forgotten diaper change, especially when the mom says it's not common and the child was in pull-ups which are designed for occasional use, might be excessive. The husband's claim that she left it for 5 hours might be inaccurate, and the fact that the clothes were a little wet doesn't seem like a major issue. The mom tried to explain herself but was cut off. Also, the husband took the child for a shower, which is a bit of an overreaction. \n\nOn the other hand, as a parent, changing a child's diaper is a shared responsibility. If the mom was busy making dinner, she could have asked for help earlier, but she did ask her husband when she realized. The fact that the husband was wrestling with the child before might have been a good time to check the diaper, but maybe he didn't think to do that. However, the mom's forgetfulness here isn't necessarily a consistent problem. \n\nThe main issue seems to be the husband's reaction. Getting angry and aggressive over a minor incident like a wet diaper, especially when it's a one-off and the mom was busy, is not healthy. The mom's stress and the husband's overreaction create a toxic dynamic. The fact that they argue a lot doesn't help either. \n\nSo, considering all that, the mom is not in the wrong here. The husband is overreacting, and the situation is more about his inappropriate response rather than her forgetting once. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
