Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person in the story is in the wrong. So the situation is that the author (a parent) forgot to change their 2.5-year-old daughter's diaper for a while. They were making dinner when they realized this. The child was in a pull-up, which doesn't hold as much as a regular diaper. The husband had just wrestled with her, and the author asked him to change the diaper. He did, but later got angry, saying the diaper was really full and her clothes were wet. The author feels he was yelling, though he claims he wasn't. The husband is upset because he got covered in pee from the wet clothes and claims the diaper was left on for 5 hours, which the author says isn't true.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The daughter is 2.5 years old, so she's probably in the process of potty training. Using a pull-up implies that she might be transitioning from diapers to training pants. The author forgot to change her, which is understandable under stress. The husband was home and the author asked him to help, which is a common thing in parenting. The husband changed her but then got angry. \n\nThe key points here are: Did the author make a mistake by forgetting? Yes, but it's noted that this doesn't happen often. The husband's reaction is what's making this a conflict. He's upset about the mess and the perceived disrespect. The author tried to explain the stress of the day, but the husband dismissed the excuse. The author left to avoid arguing. \n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. Forgetting once, especially under stress, isn't necessarily wrong. Asking the spouse for help is reasonable. However, the severity of the husband's reaction might be the issue. If the diaper was left on for an extended time, causing discomfort to the child, that's a problem, but the author disputes the 5-hour claim. The husband's anger over being covered in pee could be seen as overreacting. \n\nAlso, the fact that they are in a situation where the husband is doing the diaper change (which the author usually handles) might have added to his frustration. But the author didn't intentionally neglect the child. The husband's response of getting angry and cutting off the explanation seems harsh. \n\nIn terms of responsibilities, parents often share tasks, and asking for help is normal. The author's mistake was forgetting, but that's a one-time thing. The husband's overreaction might be the main issue here. So the author isn't in the wrong for the mistake, but maybe the husband is in the wrong for his reaction. So the answer should be B.\n"
