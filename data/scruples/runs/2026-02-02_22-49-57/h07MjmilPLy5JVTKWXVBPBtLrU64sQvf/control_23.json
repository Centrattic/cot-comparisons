Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for not changing their daughter's diaper. The situation is that the author forgot to change the diaper for a 2.5-year-old who was in a pull-up. The husband came home, and the author asked him to change it, but he got angry and there was some yelling. The author says that this is not a normal occurrence, and that the husband exaggerated the time she left the diaper on. The author was making dinner and had a stressful day, leading to the oversight.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate if the author did something wrong. The key points here are: the child is 2.5, uses pull-ups, and the author forgot to change the diaper. The husband claims she left it for 5 hours, but the author disputes that. The child's clothes got wet, and the husband was upset about being covered in pee. \n\nChanging a diaper (or pull-up) for a toddler is a shared responsibility, especially when both parents are present. The author was in the middle of making dinner, which is a common stressor. However, the child's hygiene and comfort are important. The author did realize the mistake and asked the husband to help, which is a reasonable action. The husband's reaction seems excessive, especially if the time period was not as long as claimed. The fact that this is not a regular occurrence also points to it being a one-time mistake under stress.\n\nThe husband's response of anger and yelling seems disproportionate. The author left the room to avoid further conflict, which might be why they left it at that. The main issue here is whether the author is at fault for the oversight. Given that it was a stressful day and not a routine issue, the author might not be in the wrong. The husband's reaction, including the claim of disrespect, seems unwarranted. The author tried to delegate the task when they realized the mistake, which is a good step. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because the oversight was a one-time mistake under stress, and the husband's reaction was excessive. The author made an effort to address it once noticed, and the husband's accusations seem unfounded.\n"
