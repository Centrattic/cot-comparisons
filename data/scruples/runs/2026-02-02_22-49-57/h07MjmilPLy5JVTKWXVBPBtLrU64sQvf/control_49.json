Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The situation is about a parent forgetting to change their daughter's diaper, and the husband getting upset about it. The daughter is 2.5 years old, so she's probably in pull-ups, which are like training pants.\n\nFirst, the user is asking if they're the asshole. The key points here are: the mother forgot to change the diaper because of a stressful day while making dinner. She asked her husband to do it, and he did, but then got angry, saying she left it for five hours (which she disputes) and felt disrespected because her kid's clothes were wet. He kicked or threw something, and now they're arguing a lot. The background is that this is rare, and the mother usually changes the diaper regularly.\n\nSo, is the mother in the wrong? Well, forgetting once in a while, especially during a stressful day, seems understandable. Kids can be demanding, and if she was busy with dinner, maybe she lost track of time. However, she did ask her husband to change the diaper when she realized, so she wasn't completely neglecting the situation. He did the task but then reacted angrily. The husband's reaction might be a bit harsh\u2014he could have just changed the diaper without getting upset. The mother left because she didn't want to argue, which shows she's trying to avoid conflict, but the husband's behavior seems more at fault here. The claim that it was disrespectful because he got covered in pee is a bit odd. If the kid was in wet clothes, maybe the husband could have handled it calmly. Also, the husband's accusation of 5 hours not being true adds to the conflict. So, the mother's mistake was a one-time forgetfulness, but the husband's overreaction is the bigger issue. The answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
