Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a parent forgetting to change their 2.5-year-old daughter's diaper, which led to her being in a pull-up that leaked, and the husband getting upset.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The daughter is 2.5, which is an age where many kids are potty training. If she's in a pull-up, maybe she's not fully trained yet. The parent forgot to change the diaper, and when the husband asked to help, he got angry because the diaper was full and there was a mess. The parent says it was a stressful day and they lost track of time while making dinner. The husband claims it was 5 hours, but the parent disputes that. The parent also mentions that this doesn't usually happen and that they're normally on top of diaper changes.\n\nNow, the question is whether the parent is in the wrong. The parent's excuse is the stressful day and time management. The husband feels disrespected because he ended up handling the mess. But the parent didn't intentionally neglect the child. It's a momentary lapse. Also, the parent was trying to manage dinner, which is a common household task. The husband's reaction seems a bit harsh, especially if this isn't typical. The parent left quickly to avoid an argument, which might indicate they felt guilty, but the situation might be blown out of proportion by the husband's response.\n\nConsidering all factors, the parent made a mistake but it's a human error, not intentional neglect. The husband's anger over a wet diaper might be disproportionate. The parent tried to delegate the task, which shows they weren't trying to avoid responsibility. So, the answer is likely B, the parent is not in the wrong here.\n"
