Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not changing their daughter's diaper. The situation involves a 2.5-year-old in a pull-up diaper that didn't hold well, leading to some mess. The husband got angry, even though the author says this is unusual and it was a stressful day.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if not changing the diaper was a mistake. The author mentions it was a one-time slip-up, not a regular habit. The daughter is 2.5, so maybe she's in the process of potty training, hence the pull-ups. The parent was busy making dinner when they realized the oversight. They asked the husband to help, but he got angry. The husband thought it was left for 5 hours, but the author disputes that. \n\nThe key points here are intent and frequency. The author didn't intentionally neglect the child; it was an accident due to a stressful day. They took responsibility by asking for help. The husband's reaction seems harsh, maybe overreacting. The fact that this isn't a recurring issue suggests it's a one-off mistake. \n\nAlso, the husband's claim of being \"covered in pee\" might be a point of contention. However, the author didn't cause the mess intentionally. The husband's anger seems disproportionate, especially since the author had no prior history of neglect. The user's perspective is that the author is not in the wrong, which aligns with my assessment. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
