Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent forgetting to change their 2.5-year-old daughter's diaper for a period of time. The husband got home, was asked to change the diaper, and became angry. The parent feels they're not at fault, but the husband is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the details. The child is 2.5, so she's in pull-ups, which aren't as absorbent as regular diapers. The parent forgot to change her, leading to a full diaper and some wet clothes. The husband took over, got angry, and the parent left the argument because they don't want to argue. The background says this is not a regular occurrence, and it was a stressful day where they lost track of time.\n\nThe husband claims she left it for 5 hours, which the parent denies. He also feels it's disrespectful because he ended up covered in pee. The parent is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main points here: Did the parent neglect the child's needs? Forgetting once, especially during a stressful time, isn't necessarily wrong. However, the child's hygiene is important. But considering that this is a one-time incident and not a pattern, it might be understandable. The parent was in the middle of making dinner, which is a valid distraction. However, a 2.5-year-old is old enough that a parent should be more attentive to their needs. Maybe the parent could have been more proactive in checking the diaper, but it's a single instance.\n\nThe husband's reaction seems harsh. Calling it a 5-hour neglect when it's not true and being angry about being covered in pee might be overreacting. The parent did ask him to help, so they weren't entirely unresponsive. The husband's anger leading to him throwing or kicking something adds to the tension.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parents share the duty of caring for the child. The parent wasn't ignoring it entirely but made a mistake once. The husband's response seems disproportionate. The parent is not in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
