Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe parent (the questioner) forgot to change their 2.5-year-old daughter's diaper. She was in a pull-up, which doesn't hold as much as a regular diaper. The husband came home, and after wrestling with the kid, she asked him to change the diaper. He did, but got angry because the diaper was full and the kid's clothes were wet. The husband claims it was 5 hours, but the parent says that's not true. The parent felt he was yelling, he says he wasn't. The parent left the room to avoid arguing. The background is that this is unusual; they usually change the diaper regularly. The stress of the day made her lose track of time.\n\nSo, first, is changing a diaper every few hours normal? For a 2.5-year-old in pull-ups, they might be potty training, so maybe they're using pull-ups for naps or when it's harder. However, a 5-hour gap would be a long time. But the parent says it wasn't that long. The husband's reaction seems harsh. The parent is asking if she's the asshole.\n\nThe key points are: the parent forgot once due to stress and a busy time, it's not a recurring issue, she asked her husband to help, he reacted angrily, and now she's being blamed. The husband's claim about 5 hours and disrespect seems exaggerated. The parent isn't in the wrong for a one-time oversight, especially when she's already handling dinner and the husband was involved with the child earlier. The husband's anger over a wet diaper and being covered in pee might be overreacting. The parent isn't being negligent; it's a slip-up. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong). The husband is the one being unreasonable here.\n"
