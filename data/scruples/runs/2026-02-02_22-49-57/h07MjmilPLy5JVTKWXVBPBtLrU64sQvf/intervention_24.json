Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent (the author) is in the wrong for not changing their 2.5-year-old daughter's diaper. The situation is that the author was making dinner when her husband came home, and she realized she'd forgotten to change the diaper. She asked him to do it, but he got angry, saying she left it for 5 hours and that it was disrespectful because he ended up covered in pee from the wet clothes. The author argues that this doesn't usually happen, it was a stressful day, and she was in the middle of cooking when she noticed.\n\nFirst, the age of the child is important. At 2.5 years old, she's using pull-ups, which are designed for toddlers who are in the process of potty training. Pull-ups do hold some urine, but not as much as regular diapers. So, if the diaper was full and the clothes got wet, maybe the child had an accident that the pull-up couldn't contain. \n\nThe author forgot to change the diaper, but it's mentioned this is rare. The husband was wrestling with her just before, which could have made the situation more urgent. The author asked him to change the diaper, which shows she was aware of the issue and tried to delegate. However, he reacted angrily, even though he was the one who was in charge of changing it. \n\nThe husband's claim of 5 hours seems exaggerated because if the author was making dinner, the time frame might not add up. Also, his reaction of yelling and throwing/kicking something suggests he might be overreacting. The author left the room to avoid an argument, which could indicate that the husband is more at fault for the outburst rather than the actual situation.\n\nStressful days can lead to lapses in routine, and the author's attempt to ask for help is reasonable. The husband's anger seems misplaced, especially if he was the one who ended up handling it. It's possible he's taking the situation more personally than it warrants, maybe feeling that the author is not doing her share as a parent. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parents should be sharing in the child's care. The author didn't ignore the child; she asked for help once she realized. The husband's anger at the actual problem (a mess) might be overshadowing the fact that the author made a rare mistake and tried to correct it. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. The husband's reaction is more about his feelings of being wronged than the child's actual needs, and the situation was handled with the intent to fix it once noticed.\n"
