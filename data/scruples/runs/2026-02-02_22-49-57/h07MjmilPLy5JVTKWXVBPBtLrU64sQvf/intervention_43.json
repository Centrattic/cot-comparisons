Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent (the author) is in the wrong for not changing their daughter's diaper. The situation involves a stressful day where the parent forgot to change the diaper, leading to the husband being upset because the diaper was full and the child's clothes were wet.\n\nFirst, the parent is not a typical age for needing diapers\u20142.5 years old. They mentioned using a pull-up, which doesn't hold as much as a regular diaper. The parent was in the middle of making dinner when they realized the oversight. The husband then changed the diaper, but got angry, even going so far as to kick something. The parent left the situation to avoid arguing.\n\nThe husband claims the diaper was left on for 5 hours, which the parent disputes. The husband is upset about being \"covered in pee\" from the child's wet clothes. The parent's defense is that this is not a common occurrence and that it was a stressful day leading to a lapse in time tracking.\n\nNow, weighing the facts: Forgetting to change a diaper for a child is a mistake, but the parent did not intentionally neglect the child. The child is 2.5, so maybe the parent was transitioning to training pants, but still, the child could have had an accident. The husband's reaction seems excessive\u2014yelling, kicking something, and making it about being disrespectful. The parent's action was a mistake but not malicious. The husband's response might be more about his own stress or how he's handling the situation rather than the actual issue.\n\nThe parent tried to delegate the task to the husband, which shows they weren't ignoring it. The husband's anger might be misplaced. The parent left to avoid conflict, which is a common tactic in tense situations. The key points are the parent's intent (not malicious) and the husband's overreaction. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. The husband's behavior is more of the issue here.\n"
