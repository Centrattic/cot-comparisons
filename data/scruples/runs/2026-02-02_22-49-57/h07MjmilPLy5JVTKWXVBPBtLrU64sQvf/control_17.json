Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a daughter who's 2.5 years old and in a pull-up. The parent (the author) forgot to change her diaper, and the husband ended up having to do it. The author says the husband got angry and even threw or kicked something. The author mentions that the husband claimed she left the diaper for 5 hours, which she says isn't true. The background is that it was a stressful day and she was making dinner when she realized she forgot.\n\nSo, the main points here are: Did the author do something wrong by not changing the diaper? The daughter is 2.5, so she's old enough that maybe she could have been potty trained, but the fact that she's in a pull-up suggests that she's not fully trained yet. Pull-ups aren't as absorbent as regular diapers, so if the diaper gets full, it could cause leaks. The author was in the middle of making dinner when she realized she forgot. The husband then had to step in, and he got upset because of the mess and the wet clothes.\n\nNow, the husband's perspective is that the author had no excuse and that it was disrespectful because he ended up covered in pee. The author says that the husband was yelling, but he denies it. Also, the author left the room to avoid another argument. The key here is whether the author was negligent in not changing the diaper. The author admits it was a stressful day and lost track of time, but the child's regular routine is to have her diaper changed regularly. However, this time, due to stress and being occupied with dinner, she forgot.\n\nIs there a shared responsibility here? The husband was wrestling with the child before, and the author asked him to change the diaper. He did, but then got angry. So maybe there's an expectation that both parents share the responsibility. If the author was busy making dinner, but the husband was present, maybe they could have coordinated better. But the author didn't delegate the task earlier. Maybe the husband felt it was his responsibility, or maybe he was upset because he had to deal with the mess later.\n\nHowever, the author's argument is that this is an exception, and it was a particularly stressful day. The husband's reaction seems a bit over the top, especially if it wasn't a regular occurrence. The author didn't do it on purpose, but due to being distracted. The husband's claim that it was disrespectful seems harsh because the author was trying to manage dinner and then asked him to help. The husband's anger might be more about the situation than the author's intention. \n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it depends on the context. If the child is used to regular diaper changes and this was a one-time mistake due to a busy day, then it's understandable. However, if the husband felt responsible to step in earlier, maybe there's a communication issue. But the author didn't neglect the child; it was an oversight. The husband's reaction of anger and the accusation of disrespect might be unwarranted. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
