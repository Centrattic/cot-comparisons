Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they are the asshole (AITA) for not changing their daughter's diaper. The situation is that they forgot to change the diaper, asked their husband to do it, and he got angry. The daughter is 2.5 years old, using pull-ups, and the husband claims she was in a full diaper for 5 hours, leading to some mess.\n\nFirst, the key points: The daughter is 2.5, so she's probably out of diapers and using pull-ups. The parent forgot to change her, but it's not a regular occurrence. The parent was making dinner when they realized the oversight. They asked the husband to change the diaper, which he did, but then he got angry, maybe yelling. The parent left because they didn't want to argue.\n\nThe husband's reaction seems intense. He says she was in the diaper for 5 hours, but the parent disputes that. The husband is upset about being covered in pee and feels disrespected. But the parent says it's not something that happens often and was due to a stressful day and being occupied with dinner.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The parent forgot, which is a mistake, but it's not like they were intentionally neglecting the child. They did change the diaper when they realized. The husband's reaction might be disproportionate. The child is old enough that maybe she could have been more potty-trained, but 2.5 is still a transitional age. The parent's stress and multitasking could be a factor. The husband's claim about 5 hours might be an exaggeration. The parent didn't refuse to do it; they just forgot and asked the husband to help. The husband's anger over a wet diaper and a minor mess seems harsh, especially if it's a one-time incident. The parent left because they didn't want to argue, which is understandable.\n\nSo, the author made a mistake but isn't in the wrong because it's an isolated incident due to stress, they took responsibility by asking for help, and the husband's reaction seems over the top. The husband's accusation of disrespect for the mess might be a bit much. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
