Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a parent forgetting to change their 2.5-year-old daughter's diaper. The daughter is in a pull-up, which doesn't hold as much pee. The husband comes home and the mom asks him to change the diaper, but she later realizes she forgot to do it earlier. The husband gets angry, says she left her for 5 hours (which she denies), and he claims she was disrespectful because he ended up covered in pee.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the mom made a mistake. Forgetting to change a diaper is something that can happen, especially if it's a stressful day. The mom says this doesn't usually happen, and she was in the middle of making dinner. She asked her husband to help, which is a reasonable request for shared responsibilities. But she did forget, so maybe there's some fault there, but not necessarily being in the wrong entirely.\n\nThen there's the husband's reaction. He got angry, threw or kicked something, and was upset about the diaper being full and the mess. He claims she left it for 5 hours, which she says is not true. The key here is how he handled the situation. Yelling and anger over a diaper that got a little wet might be an overreaction. Also, if the mom apologized or explained, but he was dismissive and cut her off, that's problematic.\n\nThe fact that arguing is common in their relationship might play a role. The mom left because she didn't want to argue, which shows she's trying to avoid conflict, but the husband's response is what escalated things. The real issue might be his reaction rather than the mom's forgetfulness. Also, the husband taking the child for a shower is a practical response, but his anger seems excessive.\n\nSo, the mom made a mistake in forgetting, but given that it's not usual and was due to a stressful day, it's not unreasonable. The husband's reaction is more concerning here. Therefore, the author (mom) is not necessarily in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
