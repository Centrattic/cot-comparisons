Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves forgetting to change their 2.5-year-old daughter's diaper, which led to some conflict with her husband.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The daughter is 2.5 years old and was in a pull-up, which doesn't hold as much pee. The mother realized she forgot to change the diaper while making dinner. She asked her husband to change it after he got home from wrestling with the kid. The husband then got angry, saying she left it for 5 hours (which she denies). He was upset about the mess and felt disrespected. The mother left because arguing is common and she didn't want to be yelled at.\n\nNow, considering the age of the child, 2.5 is usually potty training age. Maybe she's in the process of learning, so needing more frequent changes could happen. The mother said it's not a regular occurrence and that she's usually good about changing diapers. The stress of the day caused her to lose track of time. The husband's reaction seems harsh, especially since she admitted it was her mistake and asked him to help. He accused her of an exaggeration (5 hours) and being disrespectful because of the mess. But the mother left the situation because she didn't want to argue, which shows she's trying to avoid conflict.\n\nFrom a general perspective, forgetting once in a while due to stress isn't unusual. The husband's overreaction might be the issue here. The mother's responsibility is acknowledged, but the husband's response of anger and yelling (even if he didn't think he was yelling) makes it seem like he's being overly critical. The key points are: it's not a recurring issue, the mother asked for help, and the husband's reaction is more about the mess and perceived disrespect than the child's well-being. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The husband's reaction is more excessive. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
