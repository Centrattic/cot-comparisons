Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person in the situation is the asshole (AITA) for not changing their daughter's diaper. Let me read through the details carefully.\n\nSo, the daughter is 2.5 years old and was in a pull-up. The parent forgot to change her diaper. The husband came home while the parent was making dinner. The husband was wrestling with the kid before, and the parent asked him to change the diaper. The husband went to change it, got angry because the diaper was full and the kid's clothes were wet. The parent says it was a stressful day and they lost track of time. The husband claims it was 5 hours, but the parent says that's not true. He got really upset, maybe even yelling, and the parent left because they didn't want to argue. The husband also felt disrespected because he ended up covered in pee.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the parent is wrong. The parent forgot once, but it's not a regular thing. The daughter is 2.5, which is an age where they might be transitioning out of diapers, but still needing occasional help. The parent was in the middle of making dinner when they realized. The husband was asked to change the diaper, but the parent might have felt stressed and couldn't handle it at that moment. \n\nThe husband's reaction seems a bit over the top. Changing a diaper isn't the end of the world, especially for a 2.5-year-old. The parent didn't do it, but it's a one-time mistake. The husband's anger might stem from feeling that the parent is irresponsible, but the parent has a valid excuse of a stressful day. Also, the husband says it was disrespectful to him being covered in pee, but maybe that's his own issue with the situation rather than the parent's fault. \n\nOn the other hand, the parent could have tried to change the diaper themselves if the husband was busy wrestling. But he was home and available. The parent asked him to do it, so they might not be entirely wrong in delegating the task. However, the parent did forget, which contributed to the problem. \n\nBut considering it's a one-time incident, and the parent is usually consistent, maybe the husband overreacted. The parent leaving the situation to avoid arguing isn't necessarily wrong. The key here is whether the parent's action was negligent. Since it was a slip-up and not a pattern, the parent isn't in the wrong. The husband's reaction is more concerning here. So the answer is B.\n"
