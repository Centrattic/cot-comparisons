Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent forgetting to change their daughter's diaper, and the husband getting angry about it.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 2.5 years old and was in a pull-up. The parent forgot to change her diaper, leading to her clothes getting a bit wet. The husband got angry, and there was an argument. The parent feels bad because it was a stressful day and they were making dinner, but it's not something that happens often.\n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? Well, forgetting once in a while isn't necessarily wrong, especially if it's an off-day. The daughter was in a pull-up, which is meant for older kids and holds less, so maybe the parent thought it would be okay. The husband's reaction seems a bit harsh. He accused the parent of leaving her for 5 hours (which they say isn't true) and being disrespectful because he ended up covered in pee. But the parent tried to explain and left the room to avoid arguing. \n\nThe key points are: it's not a recurring issue, the parent was busy with dinner, and the husband's reaction was disproportionately angry and cut off their explanation. The parent also didn't mean to neglect the child. So the parent isn't at fault here. The answer is B.\n"
