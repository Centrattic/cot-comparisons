Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a parent who forgot to change their 2.5-year-old daughter's diaper. The husband came home, and the author asked him to change it since she was making dinner. The husband got angry, saying she left the diaper for 5 hours, but she says that's not true. He claims it was disrespectful because he ended up covered in pee. The author left the situation to avoid an argument and now is asking if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author made a mistake. Forgetting to change a diaper, especially for a child who's using pull-ups, could be a problem. But the context is important. The daughter is 2.5, so maybe she's in the process of potty training. If the pull-up got wet, maybe the author was busy making dinner and it slipped her mind. The husband's reaction seems harsh\u2014accusing her of leaving it for 5 hours when she says it wasn't that long. The author tried to explain, but he cut her off. Also, the husband kicked something, which suggests he was angry. The author left the room to avoid a fight, which is a common dynamic in some relationships.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, forgetting a diaper change isn't the end of the world, especially if it's a one-time slip-up. The stress of the day might have played a role. However, the husband's reaction is also problematic. He's escalating the situation by yelling (even if he says he wasn't) and being disrespectful. The key points here are the frequency of occurrence\u2014this doesn't happen ever\u2014so it's an isolated incident. The author did ask the husband to help, but he took it as a personal attack. The husband's claim about being disrespectful might not hold because the child's hygiene is a shared responsibility. The author's choice to step away from the argument is understandable given their communication issues.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author isn't in the wrong. They had a stressful day, forgot once, and the husband's reaction is overly harsh. The answer would be B, meaning the author is not the asshole.\n"
