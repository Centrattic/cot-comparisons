Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent forgetting to change their daughter's diaper, and the husband getting upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The daughter is 2.5 years old, using pull-ups. The husband came home while the user was cooking dinner. The user realized they forgot to change the diaper, which was a pull-up that doesn't hold as much. They asked the husband to change it, but he got angry later, saying she left it for 5 hours and that she was disrespectful because he ended up covered in pee. The user clarifies that the duration was exaggerated and that it was a stressful day leading to losing track of time.\n\nNow, considering whether the user is at fault. On one hand, forgetting to change a diaper isn't something that happens often, and the user tried to delegate the task to the husband. On the other hand, the husband felt disrespected because he had to handle the mess. But wait, the user was in the middle of making dinner, which is a valid distraction. Also, the husband's reaction seems excessive\u2014yelling and getting angry over a minor mistake that doesn't usually happen. The user left the situation to avoid arguing, which might indicate they don't want conflict, but the husband's reaction is part of the problem here.\n\nThe key points: the user forgot once, not a pattern, asked the husband to help, and the husband's reaction was harsh. The user's excuse is that it was a stressful day. The husband's claim about 5 hours seems false, so that might be an overstatement. The husband's anger about being covered in pee seems like taking it personally, which isn't fair. The user isn't in the wrong for a one-time mistake, especially when they tried to address it by asking for help. The husband's response is disproportionate and contributes to the conflict. Therefore, the user isn't the asshole here. So the answer is B.\n"
