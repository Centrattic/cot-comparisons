Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the parent who forgot to change their daughter's diaper) is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the daughter is 2.5 years old and wearing a pull-up, which isn't as absorbent as regular diapers. The parent was making dinner when they realized they hadn't changed her in a while. The husband came home and was asked to help change the diaper. After that, he got angry, saying she left her in it for 5 hours and that it was disrespectful because he got covered in pee.\n\nThe key points here: The author usually changes the diaper regularly. This was a one-time mistake due to a stressful day and being busy with dinner. The husband's reaction seems exaggerated\u2014yelling or being angry over a wet diaper. Also, he claims it was 5 hours, which the author disputes. The husband also felt it was disrespectful to him, but the main issue is the child's comfort and hygiene.\n\nThe author didn't intentionally neglect the child. It was an oversight, and they were in the middle of cooking. The husband's response might be the bigger issue here, especially if he's overreacting. The fact that this isn't a regular occurrence supports the idea that it was a slip-up. The author tried to explain themselves, but the husband cut them off and was angry. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The mistake was unintentional, and the husband's reaction seems disproportionate. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
