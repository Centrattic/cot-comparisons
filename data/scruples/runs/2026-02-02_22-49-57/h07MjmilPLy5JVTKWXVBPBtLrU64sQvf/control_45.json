Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is the asshole (AITA) for not changing their daughter's diaper.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 2.5 years old, using pull-ups. The mother forgot to change her diaper because she was busy making dinner. The husband came home, and the mother asked him to do it. He got angry, saying she left it for 5 hours (which she claims isn't true) and that her clothes were wet, making him \"covered in pee.\" \n\nThe key points here are: the daughter usually has her diaper changed regularly, but this time was a stress-induced oversight. The mother didn't mean to leave it for that long, and the husband reacted angrily, kicking something. The mother left the argument because they argue a lot. \n\nI need to assess if the mother was wrong. She forgot once under stress, which is understandable. The husband's reaction seems excessive\u2014yelling, kicking things, holding a 5-hour claim (which she denies). The mother's action was a mistake, but not intentional neglect. The husband's response might be the bigger issue here. \n\nSo, is the mother wrong? Probably not. Parents make mistakes, and one instance of forgetfulness isn't necessarily inconsiderate. The husband's overreaction and not helping without being prompted might be his fault. The mother did ask him to help, which was appropriate. The husband's anger seems unwarranted given that it's a one-time slip-up and the daughter isn't harmed. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
