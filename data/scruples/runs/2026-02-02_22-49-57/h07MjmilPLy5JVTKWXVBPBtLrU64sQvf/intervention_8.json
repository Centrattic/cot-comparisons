Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author forgot to change their daughter's diaper for a bit, and the husband got upset. The daughter is 2.5 years old, so maybe she's supposed to be out of diapers, but she's in a pull-up. The husband was wrestling with her before, and when the author asked him to change the diaper, he did but got angry.\n\nFirst, the author says they didn't realize until after dinner was being made. They mention it's not something that happens often. The husband claims she left it for 5 hours, but the author says that's not true. He was upset because he had to deal with the mess and felt disrespected. \n\nI need to consider if forgetting to change a diaper for a couple of hours is a big deal. At 2.5, maybe the child is potty training, so it's a learning phase. If it's a rare occurrence and due to stress, maybe it's understandable. The husband's reaction seems harsh. Yelling and being angry over a wet diaper might be overreacting, especially if it's not the norm. Also, the author didn't ask for help out of the blue; they were in the middle of making dinner and asked him because he was with the child. \n\nThe key points: the author made a mistake, but it's their first time, and the husband's reaction is disproportionate. The author tried to explain but was cut off. The husband's claim about 5 hours might be an exaggeration. The author didn't intend to be disrespectful, just got distracted. So, the husband might be the one acting like the asshole here. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
