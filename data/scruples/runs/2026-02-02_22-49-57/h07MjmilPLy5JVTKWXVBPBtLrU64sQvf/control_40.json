Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not changing their daughter's diaper. \n\nFirst, the daughter is 2.5 years old and was in a pull-up. The parent forgot to change her diaper, and when realizing, asked the husband to do it. The husband did it but got angry, saying she didn't have an excuse and that it was disrespectful. The parent left because they didn't want to argue.\n\nThe key points here are the context and frequency. The parent mentions that this is not something that happens ever. The daughter's diaper is regularly changed. The only issue was a stressful day where they lost track of time. The parent was making dinner when they realized the mistake and asked the husband to help. The husband claims it was 5 hours, but the parent says that's not true. The husband was upset because he got covered in pee and felt disrespected.\n\nSo, is the parent in the wrong? Well, they forgot once due to stress, which is understandable. They did ask their husband to help, which shows they took responsibility. The husband's reaction seems excessive, especially since this isn't a recurring issue. The parent left the room to avoid conflict, which is a common coping mechanism in stressful situations. The husband's anger over a one-time mistake, leading to yelling (even if he says he didn't yell), and calling it disrespectful might be an overreaction. The parent isn't doing this on purpose or regularly neglecting the child. \n\nTherefore, the parent isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
