Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not changing their daughter's diaper. The situation is that the daughter is 2.5 years old, uses pull-ups, and the parent forgot to change her diaper. The husband got home and the author asked him to change it, but there was some mishap where the diaper was really full, causing some mess. The husband got angry, and the author feels defensive.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 2.5, so she's not an infant anymore. At that age, some kids are potty trained, but maybe this one isn't fully? They're using pull-ups, which are like training diapers. So the parent might be in the process of potty training. The key point is that the parent forgot to change the diaper, leading to a mess and the husband's anger.\n\nThe parent says it's not a usual occurrence and that it was a stressful day. They were making dinner and got distracted. The husband claims the diaper was left for 5 hours, which the parent disputes. The husband also felt disrespected because he ended up covered in pee. \n\nNow, evaluating from the parent's perspective: Forgetting once is understandable, especially with a stressful day. The parent did realize the mistake and asked the husband to change the diaper. The husband's reaction was anger and yelling, which is problematic. The parent left the room to avoid an argument, which might indicate that the husband's reaction was overly harsh.\n\nHowever, the parent did have a responsibility to change the diaper, even if it was a slip-up. But given that it's a one-time forgetfulness and the daughter is in pull-ups, maybe the expectation isn't as strict as with a baby. The husband's claim of 5 hours might be an exaggeration, and the parent says it's not true. The husband's anger about being covered in pee seems a bit much, as the parent wasn't intentionally causing harm.\n\nSo, the parent made a mistake but it was a one-time thing. The husband's reaction is more concerning here. The parent isn't in the wrong for a single forgetful instance, especially under stress. The husband's anger and the accusation of disrespect might be more about how he felt rather than the actual situation. Therefore, the parent isn't the asshole here.\n"
