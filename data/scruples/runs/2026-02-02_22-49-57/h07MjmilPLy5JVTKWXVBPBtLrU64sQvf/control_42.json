Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent forgetting to change their 2.5-year-old daughter's diaper, leading to a conflict with the husband.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The daughter is 2.5 years old and uses pull-ups, which don't hold as much pee as regular diapers. The parent (the author) forgot to change the diaper, so the daughter had a wet pull-up and some wet clothes. The husband was asked to change the diaper, which he did, but then he got angry and kicked something. The author says it's not a usual occurrence and that the day was particularly stressful. The husband claims the diaper was left for 5 hours, which the author denies. He also says it was disrespectful because he ended up covered in pee. The author left the situation to avoid arguing.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. Forgetting a diaper change once, especially under stress, might be a mistake but not necessarily inconsiderate. The child is 2.5, so she might be potty training, but pull-ups are still used. The husband's reaction seems excessive\u2014yelling, kicking things, and claiming disrespect. The author didn't intentionally leave the child in a dirty diaper. She was in the middle of making dinner and had a stressful day. The husband's response could be harsh. The key here is whether the author's action was a one-time mistake versus a recurring issue. The background says it's not something that happens ever, so context matters. The husband's anger might be more about how the situation was handled rather than the actual incident. The author didn't refuse to take responsibility but was in the middle of another task. The husband's actions (throwing/kicking something) and the claim of being covered in pee as disrespectful might be overreacting. So, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong), as the author made a mistake but it's not a pattern, and the husband's reaction seems excessive.\n"
