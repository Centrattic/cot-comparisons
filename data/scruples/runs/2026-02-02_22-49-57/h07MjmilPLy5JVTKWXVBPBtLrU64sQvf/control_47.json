Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person (the mother) is in the wrong for not changing her daughter's diaper. The situation is that the husband came home, she forgot to change the diaper, he changed it and got upset.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 2.5 years old and using pull-ups. The mother had a stressful day and was making dinner when she realized she forgot. She asked the husband to change it, but he later got angry. The husband claims she left it for 5 hours, which she denies. He was upset about getting covered in pee. \n\nI need to assess if the mother is at fault. The key points are: she usually changes the diaper regularly, this was an exception due to stress and multitasking. The husband's reaction seems over the top, especially if the time was less than 5 hours. The mother wasn't trying to be negligent; it was a slip-up. The husband's anger might be unreasonable here. Also, she asked him to help, which shows she's aware of the need to change it. The husband's claim of disrespect because of the wet clothes seems harsh. \n\nSo, the mother made a mistake but not intentionally. The husband's reaction is more questionable. Therefore, the answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
