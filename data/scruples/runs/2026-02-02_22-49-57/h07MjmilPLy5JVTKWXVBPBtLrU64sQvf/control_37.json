Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent (the author) is in the wrong for not changing their daughter's diaper. The situation involves a two-and-a-half-year-old who was in a pull-up that didn't hold much pee. The parent forgot to change the diaper, the husband took over, got angry, and there was an argument.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the context of a stressful day, the child's age, and the fact that this isn't a regular occurrence. The parent mentions that they usually change the diaper regularly but had a stressful day and lost track of time while making dinner. The husband felt it was disrespectful because he ended up getting wet when he changed her. The parent says the husband claimed it was left for 5 hours, but the parent disputes that.\n\nNow, considering the child's age, a two-and-a-half-year-old is typically in the process of potty training. If they're still in pull-ups, it's possible they might not hold urine for very long, especially if they were active (like wrestling). The parent was in the middle of making dinner, which is a common scenario where one might be distracted. The husband was asked to change the diaper, which he did, but then reacted angrily. The parent felt yelled at, but the husband says he wasn't yelling. \n\nThe stress of the situation and the parent's usual responsibility are important factors. The fact that this is an isolated incident and not a recurring problem suggests that the parent isn't negligent. The husband's reaction seems disproportionate given that the parent is usually attentive. The parent's decision to step out of the argument might be seen as avoiding conflict, which is a common stress response.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parents have shared duties, but the parent was handling dinner, a task that can be time-consuming. The husband's anger over a wet diaper and getting covered in pee might be more about his own frustration than the child's well-being. The parent isn't at fault here because the situation was a one-time lapse due to a stressful day, and the usual care is maintained. The husband's overreaction and the parent's attempt to minimize conflict don't place the blame on the parent. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
