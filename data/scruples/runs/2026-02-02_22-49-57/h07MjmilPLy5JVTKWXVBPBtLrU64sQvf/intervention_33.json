Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a parent forgetting to change their toddler's diaper, leading to some conflict with their partner.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 2.5 years old, so she's probably in pull-ups. The mother forgot to change her diaper, and the husband ended up dealing with it after wrestling with the kid. The husband got angry, even though the mother says it's not something that happens often. He accused her of leaving it on for 5 hours, which she denies. The mother was making dinner and stressed, hence the oversight.\n\nNow, considering typical parenting responsibilities, it's common for parents to sometimes miss a diaper change, especially with a busy schedule or stress. The husband offered to change the diaper when asked, which shows he's willing to help. However, his reaction seems disproportionate. The mother isn't in the wrong for a forgetful moment, but maybe the husband's anger is misplaced. The key points here are the frequency of the issue (it's a one-time thing), the mother's immediate action to ask for help, and the husband's overreaction. The husband's claim of being covered in pee might be part of his frustration, but the core issue is his response to a minor mistake. So, the mother isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
