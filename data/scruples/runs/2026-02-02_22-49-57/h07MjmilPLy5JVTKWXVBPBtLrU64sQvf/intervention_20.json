Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent not changing their 2.5-year-old daughter's diaper, and the husband getting angry about it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The mother forgot to change the diaper because she was making dinner after the husband got home. The daughter was in a pull-up, which doesn't hold as much as regular diapers. The husband was wrestling with the child earlier, and the mother asked him to change the diaper. The husband then got angry, saying she left it for 5 hours (which she says isn't true), and became upset because the diaper was full and the child's clothes were wet. The mother left the room to avoid arguing.\n\nContextually, the mother mentions that this doesn't usually happen; the diaper is regularly changed. The stress of the day made her lose track of time. The husband claims she was disrespectful because he ended up getting covered in pee. The mother feels he was yelling, while he says he wasn't.\n\nNow, considering if the author (the mother) is in the wrong. The key points here are: the child's well-being, the responsibility of changing diapers, and the husband's reaction. \n\nDiapers for a 2.5-year-old should be changed regularly to prevent discomfort, rashes, and hygiene issues. However, forgetting once in a stressful day might be understandable. The husband was asked to help, so it's a shared responsibility. The mother wasn't neglecting the child on purpose; she was distracted and under stress. \n\nThe husband's reaction seems exaggerated. Accusing her of leaving it for 5 hours when she didn't, and calling it disrespectful because of getting peed on (which is part of the diaper's function), seems harsh. The mother didn't ignore the problem; she realized and asked for help. The husband's anger over a minor oversight, especially when it's infrequent, points to possible overreaction.\n\nSo, the mother made a mistake but under stress, and the husband's response is disproportionate. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
