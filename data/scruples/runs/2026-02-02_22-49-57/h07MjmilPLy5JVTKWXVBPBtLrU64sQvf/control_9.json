Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the parent (the author) is in the wrong for not changing their daughter's diaper. The daughter is 2.5 years old, so she's using pull-ups, which don't hold as much as regular diapers. The parent was making dinner when the husband came home. The parent asked the husband to change the diaper, but then the husband got angry because the diaper was full and the clothes were wet. The parent mentions it's not a regular occurrence and that the day was particularly stressful, leading to a lapse in time management.\n\nFirst, considering the child's age, at 2.5, many kids are moving towards potty training, but accidents can still happen. The parent says they regularly change diapers, so this is an exception. The husband claims she left it for 5 hours, but she says that's not true. The parent was busy making dinner when they realized they forgot. The husband took over, but became upset, even threatening to throw or kick something. The parent felt yelled at, even if the husband denies it.\n\nNow, the key points here: Neglect? The child wasn't harmed, just had a wet diaper and clothes. The parent forgot once due to stress and a busy moment, which is understandable. The husband's reaction seems disproportionate. The parent did ask for help, which shows they weren't ignoring the situation entirely. The husband's anger over a single instance might indicate overreaction. Also, the parent left the situation to avoid conflict, which isn't necessarily wrong.\n\nIs the parent at fault? They forgot once, but it's not a pattern. The husband's anger and the claim of disrespect (because he might have gotten pee on him) seems harsh. The parent made an honest mistake under stress. The husband's behavior (yelling, anger) is more concerning. So the parent isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
