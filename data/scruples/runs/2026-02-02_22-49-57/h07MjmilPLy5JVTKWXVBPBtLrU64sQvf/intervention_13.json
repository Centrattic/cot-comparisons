Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not changing their daughter's diaper. The situation is that the mother forgot to change the diaper for a while because she was making dinner. The husband changed the diaper but got angry, claiming she left it for 5 hours and that she was disrespectful. The daughter is 2.5 years old and was in a pull-up.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether not changing the diaper was a mistake. The mother mentions it's not something that usually happens, and she lost track of time due to a stressful day. She realized the need but was in the middle of cooking. The husband took over, but his reaction was anger and accusations of disrespect.\n\nThe key points here are intent and frequency. Since this isn't a recurring issue, it's more an oversight. The mother didn't neglect the child intentionally. The husband's reaction seems disproportionate given that it's a one-time forgetfulness. Also, the daughter is in a pull-up, which might not be as effective as a regular diaper. However, the mother tried to delegate the task but the husband's response was harsh.\n\nThe husband's claim of 5 hours might be exaggerated. The mother's stress and the fact that she was handling dinner adds context. The husband's anger over being covered in pee seems more about his feelings than the child's well-being. The mother left the situation to avoid conflict, which is a common reaction in high-stress situations.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the mother isn't at fault. The husband's reaction is the main issue here. The answer should be B.\n"
