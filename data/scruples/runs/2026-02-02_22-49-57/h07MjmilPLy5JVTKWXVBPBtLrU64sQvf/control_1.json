Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a 2.5-year-old daughter whose diaper wasn't changed, leading to some wet clothes and a heated argument with the husband. \n\nFirst, the author forgot to change the diaper because they were busy making dinner. The daughter was in a pull-up, which doesn't hold as much as a regular diaper. The husband, after wrestling with the child, was asked to change the diaper. He did, but then got angry and upset. The author points out that this isn't something that happens often and that the husband exaggerated the time (5 hours vs actual time) and the disrespect.\n\nNow, considering the age of the child, 2.5 years old is old enough that holding urine might be an issue, but it's not uncommon for toddlers to need regular diaper changes. The author forgot, which could be due to a stressful day and being occupied with dinner. However, the husband's reaction seems harsh. He took it personally, claiming it was disrespectful because he got covered in pee. But the author didn't intentionally make him get covered; it was a mistake in a busy moment.\n\nAlso, the husband's response\u2014getting angry and acting like it was a deliberate act\u2014might be overreacting. The author tried to explain but was cut off, which suggests communication issues in the relationship. The fact that arguments are common here points to a pattern of conflict, not just an isolated incident.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did ask the husband to help, which is a reasonable request. The mistake was a lapse in an otherwise routine task, and the husband's reaction seems disproportionate. The author left the task to the husband, which is a shared responsibility, and the husband handled it but then became upset about the state of the diaper.\n\nSo, the key points are whether the author's mistake was significant enough to warrant the husband's anger. Since the author didn't do it on purpose, and it's not a recurring issue, the blame isn't entirely on the author. The husband's reaction seems more about his own frustration and taking it personally rather than the actual situation. The author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
