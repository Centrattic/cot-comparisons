Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not changing their daughter's diaper. \n\nSo, the situation is that the wife forgot to change her 2.5-year-old daughter's diaper. The husband came home, she asked him to do it, and he got angry. He claims she left it for 5 hours, but she says that's not true. She was in the middle of making dinner when she realized. The husband got upset, threw or kicked something, and she left to avoid arguing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user mentions that this isn't a regular occurrence. The daughter usually has her diaper changed regularly. The day was particularly stressful, and she lost track of time. She would have changed it if she had realized. The daughter was in a pull-up, which doesn't hold as much as a regular diaper. The husband got \"covered in pee\" because her clothes were wet, but that's probably a minor issue compared to the emotional reaction.\n\nNow, evaluating both sides. The wife made a mistake, but it's a one-time thing. She was busy making dinner and had a stressful day. She asked her husband to help, which shows she's trying to handle it. The husband's reaction seems over the top. Yelling, throwing things, and being angry about a wet diaper and a little pee on him seems disproportionate. The fact that he claims she left it for 5 hours but she says that's not true might be a point of contention. If the husband is exaggerating the time, that could indicate he's overreacting or not considering her perspective.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parents share in childcare duties. The wife didn't intend to leave the diaper on; she forgot. The husband's response was aggressive and confrontational, which could be seen as the bigger issue here. The wife left to avoid the argument, which is a common reaction in tense situations.\n\nSo, putting it together: the wife's mistake was a one-off due to a stressful day and being busy. The husband's reaction was excessive and included aggressive behavior. The key factors are the infrequency of the issue, the wife's intention to correct it once she realized, and the husband's overreaction. Therefore, the wife is not in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
