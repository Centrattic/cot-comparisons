Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (a parent) is the asshole for not changing their 2.5-year-old daughter's diaper. The situation involves a stressful day where the mom forgot to change the diaper, leading to a conflict with her husband.\n\nFirst, 2.5-year-olds typically start using the potty, so maybe a pull-up isn't necessary. But the mom might have used it due to the situation. She was making dinner, her husband came home, and she asked him to change the diaper. He got upset, saying she left it for 5 hours (which she denies) and that he was covered in pee. She left because arguing was common and she didn't want to face the yelling.\n\nThe key points here: Did she forget, yes, but it's a one-time stress-induced incident. The husband claims it was disrespectful, but is that fair? The daughter was in a pull-up, which might not be ideal but doesn't mean neglect. The husband got angry over a wet diaper and a full one. Changing a diaper for a toddler is a shared responsibility, so asking him to do it shouldn't be a problem. The husband's reaction seems excessive. The mom did ask him to help, indicating she wanted to manage it, but he took it out on her. Also, the fact that this isn't a recurring issue matters. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
