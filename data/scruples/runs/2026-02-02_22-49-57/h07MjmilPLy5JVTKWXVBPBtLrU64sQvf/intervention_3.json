Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not changing their daughter's diaper. Let's break down the situation.\n\nThe daughter is 2.5 years old, using a pull-up. The mom forgot to change her diaper, possibly because she was busy making dinner after a stressful day. When she realized, she asked the husband to help. He got angry, saying she left her in it for 5 hours (which she denies) and that she was disrespectful because he got covered in pee when he changed her. The husband kicked something, and the argument escalated.\n\nFirst, the mom forgot, which is understandable under stress. She mentioned it's not usual. The husband's reaction seems harsh. Accusing her of leaving it for 5 hours when she says it's not true might indicate he's exaggerating or not listening. Kicking something sounds like an aggressive reaction. The mom left to avoid arguing, which suggests she's not trying to be difficult.\n\nThe husband's claim about disrespect because he got peed on seems like he's taking it personally, maybe overstepping. The main issue is whether the mom was negligent. Since she didn't intentionally leave the diaper on, and it's not a recurring problem, it's more about a momentary lapse. The husband's response seems disproportionate. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
