Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author (the mom) is in the wrong for not changing her 2.5-year-old daughter's diaper. \n\nFirst, the context: The daughter is 2.5, so she's supposed to be in pull-ups by now. The mom was in the middle of making dinner when she realized she forgot to change the diaper. She asked her husband to help, but he got angry, saying she left it for 5 hours (which she disputes). He was upset because the diaper was full, the kid's clothes were wet, and he felt \"disrespected\" being covered in pee.\n\nNow, the key points to consider. At 2.5 years old, most kids are potty trained, so using a pull-up might be unusual. However, the parent mentions that the daughter is in a pull-up which doesn't hold as much. Maybe the child had an accident, which is possible even if she's using pull-ups. The mom forgot to check, but she does regularly change the diaper. It was a stressful day, she lost track of time. She realized the issue and asked her husband for help. \n\nThe husband's reaction seems a bit harsh. He accused her of leaving it for 5 hours, which she says isn't true. He also felt disrespected because he got covered in pee. That part is a bit odd because if the kid's clothes were wet, maybe the husband got some on him when handling her. But is that a valid reason for being upset? Maybe he felt it was his responsibility, but the mom was the one who asked him to help. Did she do something wrong by not changing it? Well, it's a once-in-a-while slip-up. The mom is usually responsible, and this was an exception due to stress. \n\nThe husband's anger might be more about the situation than the actual problem. Arguing over a wet diaper seems excessive. The mom left it because she was in the middle of cooking, and she asked for help. The dad's reaction of throwing/kicking something and being angry might be the bigger issue here. \n\nSo, the mom made a mistake, but it's an understandable slip-up, especially with stress. The husband's reaction is disproportionate. The fact that this doesn't usually happen and the mom is usually on top of things suggests she's not at fault here. The key is whether the mom's action was negligent. Since she's usually careful, and this was a one-time oversight, the blame is on the husband for overreacting.\n"
