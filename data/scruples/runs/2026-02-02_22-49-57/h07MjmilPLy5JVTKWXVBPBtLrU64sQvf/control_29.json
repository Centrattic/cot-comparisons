Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for not changing their daughter's diaper. The daughter is 2.5 years old and wearing pull-ups, which don't hold as much. The parent forgot to change the diaper, and the husband changed it but got angry. The parent is asking if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parent says this isn't something that happens often. The day was particularly stressful, and they lost track of time while making dinner. The husband claims it was 5 hours, but the parent disagrees. The husband was angry about the mess and felt disrespected because he ended up covered in pee. \n\nNow, 2.5-year-olds are usually potty-trained. However, the parent mentioned using pull-ups, which might mean the child isn't fully trained yet, or maybe the parent is still using them for convenience. If the child is supposed to be in diapers but is in a pull-up, maybe that's part of the issue. But the parent says they normally change the diaper regularly, just forgot once due to stress.\n\nThe husband's reaction seems extreme. Yelling and being angry over a wet diaper might be over the top, especially if it's not a frequent issue. The parent tried to explain themselves, but the husband cut them off. The parent left because they didn't want to argue. \n\nIs the parent at fault? Well, forgetting once in a stressful day might be understandable, especially if the child is in a pull-up that doesn't hold as well. The parent was in the middle of cooking. The husband's reaction seems disproportionate. However, the parent did ask the husband to change the diaper, which is a shared responsibility. The husband might feel that the parent didn't manage their time well, but the situation was a one-time slip-up.\n\nThe key points are: it's not a recurring issue, the parent was dealing with a stressful day, the husband's anger seems excessive, and the parent tried to ask for help. Considering all that, the parent isn't in the wrong here. The husband's reaction is the bigger issue. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
