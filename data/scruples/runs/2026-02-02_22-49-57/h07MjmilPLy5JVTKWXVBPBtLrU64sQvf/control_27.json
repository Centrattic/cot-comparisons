Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a parent forgetting to change their daughter's diaper. The daughter is 2.5 years old and was in a pull-up. The parent (the questioner) was making dinner when they realized the diaper wasn't changed. They asked their husband to do it, and then there was some conflict when he got angry.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the main points. The key issue is whether the parent is at fault for not changing the diaper. The parent says it didn't happen often, and it was a stressful day where they lost track of time. They were in the middle of making dinner. The husband claims it was left for 5 hours and that the parent is inexcusable, even though the parent denies the 5-hour claim. The husband got angry, threw or kicked something, and the parent felt yelled at but left to avoid conflict.\n\nSo, the parent's defense is that it's a rare mistake under stress. The husband is upset about the mess and feeling disrespected. The parent did ask the husband to help, which shows responsibility. The husband's reaction seems excessive, especially if the parent was otherwise doing their duties. The parent isn't in the wrong for a one-time oversight, especially when they took responsibility by asking for help. The husband's anger might be more about how it affected him (getting covered in pee) rather than the child's well-being. The parent's choice to leave to avoid arguing isn't a sign of being in the wrong but of wanting to de-escalate.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is whether the person's actions were inconsiderate or harmful. Here, the parent made a mistake but it's not recurring. The husband's reaction seems overblown. So the answer is B, the parent is not in the wrong.\n"
