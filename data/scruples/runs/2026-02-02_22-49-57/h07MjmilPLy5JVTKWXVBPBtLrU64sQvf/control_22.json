Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. So, the situation is about a parent forgetting to change their 2.5-year-old daughter's diaper. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the daughter is 2.5 years old, which is a pretty young age. At that age, kids are usually still using pull-ups because they're learning to use the potty. So maybe the parent isn't in the wrong for not changing it immediately, especially if it's a common thing to happen occasionally.\n\nThe mom was making dinner when she realized she forgot. She asked her husband to change the diaper because she was in the middle of cooking. The husband did it, but got angry and kicked something. He claims she left it for 5 hours, but she says that's not true. He was upset because he felt covered in pee after the diaper was wet. However, she mentions that this is not a regular occurrence and that the day was particularly stressful, leading her to lose track of time.\n\nNow, the key points here are: Did she neglect the child? The daughter is 2.5, so maybe needing a diaper change isn't as urgent as if it were an infant. Also, the husband's reaction seems harsh. Yelling and getting angry over a wet diaper when it's not a usual thing might be overreacting. The husband took the child for a shower, which might have been necessary, but his anger seems out of proportion.\n\nThe mother did ask for help when she realized the mistake, which shows she was trying to fix it. The husband's claim that she was disrespectful because he got covered in pee seems a bit much. Also, she left because she didn't want to argue, which could indicate that the husband's reaction was part of a pattern of conflict they're having.\n\nConsidering all this, the mother's oversight was understandable given the stress of the day and her focus on dinner. The husband's reaction is more concerning because he escalated the situation with anger and accusations. So, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
