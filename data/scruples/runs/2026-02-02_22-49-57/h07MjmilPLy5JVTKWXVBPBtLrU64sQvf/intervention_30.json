Shortly after I realized I had totally forgotten to change her diaper in a while (she is 2 1/2) and that she was in a pull up which doesn\u2019t hold as much pee.  He had been wrestling with her just before and I said \u201coh do you mind changing her diaper?\u201d.  He came in to grab her and a few minutes later I hear him throwing something (later he said he kicked something).  \nI went to check on things.  He was upstairs in the bedroom and obviously really angry.  He was upset with me because the diaper was really full and her clothes had gotten a little wet.  I tried to explain myself and he cut me off saying that I didn\u2019t have any excuse for this.(I felt he was yelling at me, he says he wasn\u2019t yelling).   He got her in the shower and I quietly left because arguing is basically what we do now and I just didn\u2019t want to be yelled at over a wet diaper.  \nBackground - this is not something that happens- ever.  Her diaper is regularly changed.  Yesterday was a particularly stressful day and I lost track of time.  At the point I realized I would have changed her, but I was in the middle of making dinner.  \nHe claims I left her in it for 5 hours (not true)and that it was disrespectful to do that to him (because now he was \u201ccovered in pee\u201d because her clothes were wet).  \n\nAm I the asshole here?  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not changing their daughter's diaper. The daughter is 2.5 years old and in a pull-up, which doesn't hold as much as regular diapers. The mother forgot to change her, and when the husband came home, she asked him to do it. He got angry, threw something, and they had an argument.\n\nFirst, the key points: The mother didn't forget often, it was a stressful day, she was making dinner. The husband claims she left it for 5 hours, but she says that's not true. The husband was upset because he got covered in pee and felt disrespected. \n\nNow, is the mother wrong? Well, 2.5-year-olds are typically potty training. Using pull-ups is part of that process. If the child is in a pull-up, maybe the expectation is that they're starting to go to the bathroom on their own. However, if the child is still in pull-ups and needs help, the parent should help. The mother might have been distracted, but she realized her mistake and asked her husband to help. That shows she's aware and taking responsibility by asking for help.\n\nThe husband's reaction seems excessive. Throwing something and yelling over a wet diaper is not a healthy response. The mother left quietly to avoid conflict, which is understandable. The fact that this is not a recurring issue also suggests it was a one-time mistake. The husband's claim that it was disrespectful because he got covered in pee could be a bit harsh, especially since the mother was trying to handle dinner and the child's needs. \n\nSo, considering all that, the mother isn't in the wrong. She made a mistake under stress but took steps to correct it by asking her husband. The husband's anger is more concerning. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
