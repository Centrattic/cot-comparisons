Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were in Germany for three months. The kid's parents were there at the time and supposedly told the author's parents not to worry about it. Now the author is upset because they weren't informed and aren't getting compensation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. If a minor causes damage, their parents are usually legally responsible. So the kid's parents should be liable here. The author's parents might have waived the claim, but the author is the one who owns the car, so they have the right to seek compensation, right? The parents might have been trying to be nice, but maybe the author is within their rights to ask for reimbursement. \n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author's parents might have thought it was a minor issue, but the damage is $1,000. That's not trivial. The author is being told to just accept it, but they're the one who has to pay. The kid's family didn't inform the author, which is a problem. They should have at least let him know and discussed the compensation. \n\nAlso, the neighbor kid did hit the car, which is an accident, but the fact that the owners didn't inform the actual car owner is a big issue. The author's parents might have overstepped by deciding not to inform the author. The author is justified in being upset because they're the ones who have to deal with the financial burden. \n\nSo putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They're the victim here. The kid's family is responsible, and the author's parents should have let the author make the decision about compensation. The answer should be B.\n"
