Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that their neighbor's 16-year-old hit their parked car while they were away. The parents were told, the kid apologized, and the parents said not to worry about it. Now, the author is upset because they weren't informed and didn't get any compensation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, if someone damages another's property, they're responsible for the damages. The kid is a minor, so the parents might be liable. But the parents already told the kid not to worry about it. However, the author is the actual owner of the car, so they have a right to know about the damage and to seek compensation. The problem is that the parents handled the situation without informing the car owner, which could be a mistake.\n\nThen there's the social aspect. The author's parents were there and might have thought they were being kind by not causing trouble. But the author is now out $1000. The neighbors might feel that since the kid apologized and the parents said it's okay, the author shouldn't be upset. But the author isn't in the same location and wasn't consulted. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? They're asking for reimbursement, which is their right. The neighbors, especially the parents, might be in the wrong for not informing the owner. The author isn't at fault for standing up for their property. However, some people might say that the author should have left the matter to the parents, but that's not necessarily the case. The parents might not have the authority to waive the author's rights.\n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
