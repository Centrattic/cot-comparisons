Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's kid (16 years old) hit their parked car while they were abroad. The parents were there and interacted with the kid and his mom. The kid offered to pay, but the parents said not to worry about it. Now the author comes back and finds out about the $1,000 damage, and people are saying he's the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n\nFirst, legally, when someone causes damage to your property, they are responsible for compensating you. The kid hit the car, so he's at fault. Since he's a minor, his parents would typically be liable. But the twist here is that the author's parents were present and told the kid's family not to worry. That might complicate things. If the parents accepted the apology and dismissed the issue, maybe they thought it was resolved. But the author wasn't there, so he wasn't involved in that decision. \n\nThe key points are: the car was the author's property. Even if his parents were there, they might not have the authority to waive his right to compensation. So, the author is justified in seeking reimbursement because it's his car that was damaged. The kid and his parents were informed, and the kid offered to pay, but his parents declined. Now, the author is upset because he's out $1,000. \n\nThe neighbors might argue that since the author's parents said it's okay, but the author wasn't consulted. So, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to be compensated. The neighbors might be in the wrong for not informing him and for not following through on the kid's offer. \n\nBut maybe there's a cultural aspect here. In some places, people might resolve such issues informally, and once the parents said it's okay, the matter is closed. However, legally, the responsibility lies with the person who caused the damage. The author isn't at fault for seeking what's his. \n\nSo, I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. He's entitled to compensation for the damage caused by the neighbor's kid. The parents might have made a decision without considering the owner's perspective, but the author has a right to be reimbursed.\n"
