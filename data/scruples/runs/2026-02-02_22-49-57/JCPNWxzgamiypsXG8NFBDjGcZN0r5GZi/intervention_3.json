Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's kid hit their parked car while they were away, causing $1,000 in damage. The kid and his parents went to the author's parents, apologized, and offered to pay, but the parents said not to worry. Now, when the author returns, they're upset that they have to pay for the damage and that no one informed them. They're being told to let it go, but they feel wronged.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the legal and ethical aspects here. Legally, if a minor causes damage, the parents are usually responsible. The kid offered to pay, but the parents might not be held accountable if they didn't follow through. However, the author's parents initially told them not to worry, which complicates things. \n\nEthically, the kid caused harm and should be responsible. The parents might have resolved it by saying it's okay, but the author wasn't informed. The author's parents might have overstepped by handling it without the owner's consent. The author is now left with the financial burden because their parents didn't involve them. \n\nSo, is the author wrong to ask for reimbursement? Well, they are the rightful owner. If someone else handles the matter without consulting them, it's understandable they'd want to seek compensation. The parents might have thought they were being kind, but they didn't consider the financial impact on the author. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting to be reimbursed for their property. The kid's family should cover the damages. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
