Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the given situation. The scenario involves a neighbor's kid hitting their parked car while they were abroad, resulting in $1,000 damages. The kid and his parents went to the author's parents, apologized, and offered to pay, but the parents dismissed it. Now the author is upset because he wasn't informed and there's no compensation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In most places, if someone causes damage to your property, they are legally responsible for covering the costs. Even if the parents told the kid not to worry about it, the owner of the car (the author) has the right to seek reimbursement. The parents might have settled it, but the actual car owner's consent wasn't obtained. So legally, the author might have a right to pursue compensation.\n\nNext, the social dynamics. The author's parents might have tried to handle it by saying not to worry, possibly to avoid conflict. However, they weren't the ones who owned the car. The author argues that he's the one bearing the financial burden, which others are dismissing. This could be a case of people not considering the financial responsibility aspect.\n\nMoral perspective: The kid made a mistake, and taking responsibility by compensating is fair. The parents might have been trying to resolve it but didn't involve the actual owner. The author feels wronged because he's the one who ends up paying. It's possible that the parents overstepped by deciding not to involve the author.\n\nCommon Reddit responses to \"Am I the Asshole\" usually consider intentions and fairness. If others are telling the author to let it go, maybe they think it's a minor issue or that the kid's family is handling it. But the author is justified in wanting compensation for damages caused to his property.\n\nFactors to consider: The kid was 16, so a minor. The parents might be responsible for covering the costs since they could be liable for their son's actions. The original owner wasn't consulted, so the author's right to seek reimbursement still stands. The key here is whether the parents had the authority to waive the author's right to compensation. In most cases, they don't.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because the damage was done to his property without his knowledge, and he's entitled to compensation. The people telling him to let it go might not fully understand the financial impact or the legal rights involved. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
