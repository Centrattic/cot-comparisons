Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were in Germany. The kid and his parents approached the author's parents, apologized, and the parents didn't press charges. The author is upset because they were kept in the dark and didn't get reimbursed.\n\nFirst, let me consider the legal aspects. In many places, if someone damages your car, they are responsible for the damages. But since it was a minor (16-year-old), the parents would typically be liable. However, the parents here might have resolved it by saying not to worry. Legally, the owner of the car (the author) could still be entitled to compensation because the damage was done without their knowledge. The parents might have authority to settle the matter, but the author wasn't consulted. That could be an issue.\n\nNext, the parents' actions. They told the neighbor not to worry about it, but they were acting on behalf of their child. However, the car belongs to the author, so the parents might not have the right to waive the author's right to seek compensation. There's a potential conflict here between family dynamics and legal responsibility.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they were out of the country and didn't know about the incident. They're now facing unexpected costs. The neighbors didn't inform them, and now the parents are discouraging them from seeking reimbursement. That's a problem because the author is the one who suffers the financial loss.\n\nThe neighbors and their parents might have acted in good faith by apologizing and offering to pay, but the parents overruled the offer. Still, the author's rights are affected. The key points are whether the parents had the authority to settle the matter without the author's consent and if the author is justified in seeking compensation now.\n\nIn terms of social norms, while the neighbors might see it as resolved, the author's responsibility for the damage is real. The parents might have made a unilateral decision, but that doesn't absolve the responsible party from liability. The author isn't in the wrong for seeking reimbursement because they were the ones affected and weren't involved in the initial decision-making.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
