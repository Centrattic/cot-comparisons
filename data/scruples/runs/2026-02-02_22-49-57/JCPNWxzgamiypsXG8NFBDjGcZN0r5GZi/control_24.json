Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that a neighbor's kid hit the author's parked car while they were abroad. The kid and his parents went to the author's parents' house, apologized, and maybe offered to pay, but the parents waved it off. The author finds out upon returning and is upset about not being informed and not getting compensation. People are telling them to just forget it, but the author feels like the kid should reimburse them.\n\nSo, first, I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. The key points are: the kid's parents were involved immediately after the incident and maybe resolved it with the author's parents. The author's parents told them not to worry. Now, the author is upset because they weren't informed and didn't get compensation.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the parents accepted the apology and forgave the debt, then the kid might not be legally obligated to pay. But maybe there's a moral aspect here. The author's parents might have acted without the author's knowledge. The author is the car owner, so they should be informed. Did the parents have the authority to forgive the damages on behalf of the author? That's a question. If the parents were acting as intermediaries but didn't inform the author, that's a problem.\n\nMoral responsibility-wise, the kid caused the damage and should take responsibility. The parents might have settled it, but the author is the one who has to pay. If the kid's parents agreed to cover it, maybe they should follow through. But if the author's parents let it go, is the author overstepping by asking for reimbursement now?\n\nThe community's reaction is important here too. The author is being told to let it go, but that's because they might not understand the financial burden. The author is in a position where they had to pay out of pocket, so maybe they're justified in seeking compensation.\n\nBut the problem is whether the author's parents had the right to settle the matter without the author's knowledge. If the parents were acting as representatives, maybe they did. But if the author wasn't consulted, then maybe the resolution isn't valid. In some cases, the car owner is the one who can decide about compensation. So if the parents forgave the debt without the author's consent, the author might still have a claim.\n\nSo, in terms of fault, the kid caused the damage, the parents might have resolved it with the author's parents, but the author wasn't informed. The author is upset about not being informed and not being compensated. The author's parents might have made a decision that they shouldn't have, leading the author to be in a bad spot.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The kid and the parents are responsible for the damage. The author's parents may have acted improperly by not informing the author and forgiving the debt. The author has the right to seek compensation since they are the car owner. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
