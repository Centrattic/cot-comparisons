Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The parents were involved, and the kid offered to pay, but the author's parents told them not to worry about it. Now the author is upset because they weren't informed and aren't getting compensation. They're being told they're the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and social aspects here. Legally, when someone causes damage to another's property, they're typically responsible for covering the costs. The kid is a minor, so his parents would be liable. The fact that the kid offered to pay but was told not to worry about it complicates things. However, legally, the responsibility might still lie with the parents, even if the kid offered to pay. \n\nSocially, the parents might think it's a minor issue or don't want to involve the kid in legal matters. But from the author's perspective, they're out $1,000, and the parents are dismissing their concerns. The author's parents might have made a decision without considering their child's financial burden. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for seeking reimbursement? Well, the damage was done by someone else, and they have a right to seek compensation. Since the parents were informed and the kid offered to pay, maybe the author's request is reasonable. The fact that they weren't informed adds to the problem. The parents might have made a unilateral decision, not considering the author's position. \n\nOn the other hand, if the parents already resolved it by telling the neighbors not to worry, the author might be overstepping by going back for reimbursement. But legally, the damage is done, and it's the responsibility of the person who caused it. The author's parents might have acted without consulting them, which is a point in the author's favor. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. The responsibility lies with the other party, and the author's parents shouldn't have dismissed the issue without consulting the car owner. Therefore, the answer would be B.\n"
