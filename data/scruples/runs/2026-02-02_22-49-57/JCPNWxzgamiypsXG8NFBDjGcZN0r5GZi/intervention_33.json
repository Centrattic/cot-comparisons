Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after their neighbor's kid damaged their parked car while they were away. The key points here are:\n\n1. The kid was 16, so a minor. His parents were involved when the incident happened. They went to the author's parents' house, and the parents told them not to worry about it. The kid apologized and offered to pay, but the parents dismissed it.\n\n2. The author returned to find the damage and is upset because they weren't informed and there's no compensation. The community is telling them to accept it, but the author feels wronged.\n\nNow, legally, when a minor causes damage, the parents are typically liable. If the parents agreed to cover the costs but then didn't follow through, that's a problem. The author's parents might have let the situation slide, but the author is the car owner and has the right to seek compensation for their property. The fact that the kid and his parents were made aware of the damage and offered to pay, but the author's parents dismissed it, complicates things. The author wasn't even informed, which is a key issue. The author is now facing unexpected costs because they were out of the country.\n\nThe author isn't overreacting by wanting reimbursement for their property. The parents might have intended to handle it informally but didn't follow through. The author has the right to pursue the matter, especially if the parents didn't handle it. So, the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
