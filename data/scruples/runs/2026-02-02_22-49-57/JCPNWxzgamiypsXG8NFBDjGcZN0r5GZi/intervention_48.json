Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit the author's parked car while they were in Germany. The kid and his parents went to the author's parents' house and offered to pay, but the parents said not to worry. Now the author is upset because they weren't informed and there's $1000 in damages.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the responsibilities here. The kid caused the damage, so legally, the parents might be responsible since they're the guardians. The parents were given the option to pay but chose not to. The author's parents didn't inform them, which is a problem because the car belongs to the author, not the parents. \n\nThe author is upset they weren't told. So, is the author in the wrong for asking for reimbursement? Well, the car owner should be compensated for damages caused by someone else. The parents' decision to let it go doesn't absolve the responsible party. The author is just seeking compensation for their loss, which is reasonable. The neighbors might be at fault for not paying, and the author's parents for not informing them. The author isn't the one who caused the accident, so they shouldn't be blamed for wanting to cover their costs. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
