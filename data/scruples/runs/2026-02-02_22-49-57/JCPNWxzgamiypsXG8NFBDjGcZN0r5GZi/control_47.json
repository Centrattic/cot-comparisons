Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that their neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car when they were away, causing $1,000 in damage. The kid and his parents went to the parents' house, apologized, and the parents said not to worry about it. Now, when the author returns, they're upset about the damage and want reimbursement, but everyone says they're the asshole for asking.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most places, if someone damages another person's property, they are legally responsible for the damages. The kid is a minor, so his parents would be liable. The author's parents might have intervened, but the key point is that the author didn't know about the damage until returning. \n\nThen there's the ethical angle. The parents might have thought it was a small incident and didn't want to burden the other family, especially since the kid apologized. But from the author's perspective, they didn't have a chance to decide how to handle it. They're being asked to accept no compensation because their parents already handled it.\n\nThe author's parents might have acted without consulting them, assuming they wouldn't mind. But the author is now facing a financial burden and feels wronged. The neighbors, on the other hand, might feel that the debt was already forgiven, especially since an apology was given and their parents were upset about being asked again.\n\nI need to weigh whether the author is being unreasonable. If the parents already resolved it, maybe the author shouldn't pursue it. But if the parents didn't have the authority to forgive the debt (since they aren't the car's owner), the author could be justified in seeking reimbursement. It's a bit of a gray area because the parents acted in good faith but maybe without considering the owner's wishes.\n\nAlso, the kid's age: being 16, he's a minor, so his parents are responsible. But the author's parents might have thought that an apology and a verbal agreement were sufficient. However, from a legal standpoint, the responsibility still lies with the kid's parents.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for seeking compensation because they weren't informed and had no say in the matter. Their parents might have overstepped by not involving them, but the author isn't at fault for wanting to cover the damages they're now facing.\n"
