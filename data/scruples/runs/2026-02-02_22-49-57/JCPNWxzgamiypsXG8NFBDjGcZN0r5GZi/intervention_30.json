Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hitting their parked car while they were abroad. The author's parents were present and initially spoke to the kid and his mom. The kid offered to pay, but the parents said not to worry about it. Now the author is upset because they found out about the $1,000 damage upon returning and no one told them or compensated them.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect: when someone's property is damaged, the owner has the right to seek compensation. The kid's family was aware of the damage, and the kid offered to pay. The parents declined the offer, maybe to avoid conflict or because they thought it was a minor issue. But the author is the rightful owner, so their parents might not have the authority to waive compensation. That could be a problem.\n\nThen there's the communication issue. The parents didn't inform the author about the incident. That's a big deal because the author has the right to know about damage to their property. The parents might have thought they were handling it, but not telling their child is a mistake.\n\nEmotionally, the author is upset because they have to pay for repairs out of pocket. The neighbors are dismissive, and even their parents are telling them to forget it. The author is justified in feeling wronged because their property was damaged without their knowledge and without compensation. \n\nThe neighbors might have thought that since the kid apologized and offered to pay, and the parents accepted the apology, it's resolved. But the actual owner (the author) wasn't involved in that decision. Legally, the parents might not have the authority to settle the matter for the author. So the author is correct to seek reimbursement.\n\nSo the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong. The real issue is that the author's parents didn't inform them and possibly overstepped by not pursuing compensation on their behalf.\n"
