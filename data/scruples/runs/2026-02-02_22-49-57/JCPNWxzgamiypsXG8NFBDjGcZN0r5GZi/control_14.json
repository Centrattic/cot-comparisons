Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's kid hit their car while they were abroad, and there's no reimbursement. The parents told them not to worry about it, but the author is upset because they didn't get compensated. The user wants to know if the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. The kid is 16, which is a minor. He hit the car, apologized, and offered to pay, but the parents were against filing a claim. The author's parents told the neighbor not to worry about it. The author argues that the kid should reimburse them for $1,000 in damages. The community is saying the author is the asshole for asking.\n\nNow, considering legal aspects. In many places, if a minor causes damage, their parents are legally responsible. Even if the kid offered to pay, the parents might still be liable. The parents of the kid might have agreed not to file a claim, but that doesn't necessarily absolve them of responsibility. However, the author's parents also didn't inform them, which complicates things.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author is upset because they're out of pocket. They had to pay for repairs, and the others think they should just accept it. But the author didn't cause the damage, so it's reasonable to seek compensation. The parents might have settled it without informing the owner, which isn't fair to the author.\n\nSo, the author's parents might have made a decision without considering their child's perspective. The key points are legal responsibility and whether the author is justified in seeking reimbursement despite the initial agreement. The answer likely is B (not in the wrong) because the author is seeking what's fair for their financial loss, and the parents shouldn't have handled it without the owner's input.\n"
