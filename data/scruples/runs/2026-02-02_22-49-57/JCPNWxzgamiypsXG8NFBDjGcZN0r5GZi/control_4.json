Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor kid hit their parked car while they were abroad, causing $1,000 in damage. The parents were there and talked to the kid and his parents, but didn't inform the owner or seek reimbursement. Now the owner is upset because no one told them and there's no compensation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In most places, if someone damages your property, they're responsible for covering the costs. The kid is a minor, so his parents would typically be liable. The parents of the kid were upset about filing a claim, but the owner's parents said not to worry. However, the owner wasn't consulted, so they didn't get a say in the matter. \n\nEthically, the owner has a right to know about the damage to their property. The fact that the parents handled it without informing the owner is a problem. The kid did offer to pay, but the parents didn't follow through. The owner is now being blamed for being upset about not getting reimbursement. \n\nThe key points here are: the owner's right to be informed, the responsibility of the person who caused the damage, and the role of the parents in both situations. The author isn't at fault for wanting reimbursement. The neighbors failed to inform them and didn't properly address the damage. The parents who were present shouldn't have made a decision without consulting the car owner, especially since they might not be legally responsible. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're seeking what's rightfully theirs. The neighbors and their parents are the ones at fault for not handling the situation properly. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
