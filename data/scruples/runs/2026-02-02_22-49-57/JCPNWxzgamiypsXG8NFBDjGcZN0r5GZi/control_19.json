Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The kid and his parents went to the author's parents, who said not to worry about it. But when the author comes back, they're upset about the damage and want reimbursement. The author is being told they're the asshole for asking for money.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Even if the kid is a minor, he or his parents might still be responsible for damages. In many places, parents can be liable for their child's actions, especially if the kid was driving a car, which he is here. So the author has a right to seek compensation.\n\nThen, the communication issue. The author wasn't informed about the accident. The parents didn't tell them, but they might have thought the issue was resolved because the kid offered to pay and they said to forget it. But the author wasn't involved in that conversation, so they didn't have a chance to decide themselves. It's possible the parents overstepped by handling it without the author's input.\n\nThe author's frustration is understandable. They had to deal with the financial burden and the hassle of repairs, not to mention not being informed. The neighbors and parents might have considered the matter settled, but that doesn't negate the fact that the author owns the car and has the right to decide about compensation.\n\nHowever, the kid did apologize and offer to pay, but the parents might have already intervened. Maybe the author's parents accepted the apology and the offer, but in practice, the kid didn't follow through. The author's parents may have thought it was a minor thing, but the damage was significant.\n\nSo, the key points are liability, the right to compensation, and the lack of communication. Legally, the author might have a case. The author isn't in the wrong for seeking reimbursement after discovering the damage. The neighbors and parents might be in the wrong for not informing them and not ensuring payment was made. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
