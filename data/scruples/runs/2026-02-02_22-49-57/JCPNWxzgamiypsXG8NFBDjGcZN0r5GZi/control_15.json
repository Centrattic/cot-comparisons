Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The parents of the kid were there and even talked to the user's parents, who said not to worry. Now the user is upset because they didn't know about the damage and aren't getting reimbursed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, when someone damages another person's property, they are legally responsible for the damages. Even if the parents were there and apologized, the legal responsibility might still lie with the kid's parents since he's a minor. However, the user's parents told them not to worry, which might have been an attempt to resolve it informally. But the user wasn't informed, so they had no chance to handle it themselves.\n\nNext, the ethical angle. The kid caused damage, and the responsible parties (his parents) had the opportunity to address it but chose not to. The user's parents might have been trying to be understanding, but that doesn't absolve the other party of their responsibility. The user is now out of pocket and being told they're the asshole by others, which seems unfair.\n\nAlso, the user didn't know about the incident until returning, so they couldn't take any action. The neighbor's family didn't inform them, which is a problem. Legally, if the user's parents were acting as their proxy, maybe there's an argument, but typically, the car owner has the right to claim damages. Since the user wasn't involved, they might have a right to pursue reimbursement now.\n\nConsidering all this, the user isn't in the wrong. They're being reasonable to seek compensation for damages they didn't cause. The neighbor's family is at fault for not informing them and not compensating. So the answer should be B.\n"
