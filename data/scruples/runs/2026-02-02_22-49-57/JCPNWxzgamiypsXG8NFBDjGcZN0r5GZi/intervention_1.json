Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit the author's parked car while they were away. The kid and his parents went to the author's parents' house, apologized, and the parents said not to worry about it. When the author returned, they found the damage and are upset because they weren't informed and there's no reimbursement. The author is being told by everyone they're overreacting and the asshole.\n\nSo first, I need to consider the legal and social aspects here. Legally, if someone damages your property, they're usually responsible for repairs. The kid is a minor, so the parents would typically be liable. The parents might have an obligation to cover the damages. However, the parents might have resolved it with the author's parents, but the author wasn't part of that conversation. The author's parents might have forgiven the debt, but that doesn't mean the author has to accept it. \n\nSocially, if the parents of the kid told them not to worry about it, maybe there's an expectation that the matter is settled. However, the author is the one who owns the car and suffered the financial loss. It's possible that the author's parents didn't inform them, which is a problem because the author is the one affected. The neighbors didn't inform the author, which is a key point. The kid should have informed the car owner, even if the parents thought it was resolved with the author's parents. \n\nSo, from a legal standpoint, the parents might still be responsible. Socially, it's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't wrong for wanting compensation, especially since they weren't part of the initial resolution. The parents might have a say, but the author is the one who has to pay for repairs. \n\nBut wait, maybe the parents of the kid tried to resolve it with the author's parents, and the author's parents accepted the apology and forgiveness. If that's the case, then the author is now going back on that by seeking reimbursement. But the author wasn't there, so maybe the parents shouldn't have made that decision without consulting the author. \n\nIn many places, the car owner has the right to seek compensation. The fact that the kid is a minor doesn't absolve the parents from responsibility. The author's parents might have let it go, but that doesn't mean the author has to. The author has the right to pursue what's owed to them. \n\nSo putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The neighbors and their parents failed to inform the author, and the author is seeking what's rightfully theirs. The others are probably wrong to call the author the asshole.\n"
