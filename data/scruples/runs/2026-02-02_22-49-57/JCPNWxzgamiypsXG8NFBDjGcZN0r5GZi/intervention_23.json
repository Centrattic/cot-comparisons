Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that their neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were abroad, causing $1,000 damage. The kid and his parents went to the author's parents' house, apologized, and offered to pay, but the parents said not to worry about it. Now the author is upset because when they returned, they had to pay for the repairs and everyone is telling them they're the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical angles. In many places, if someone causes damage to another person's property, they are legally responsible to cover the costs. So the neighbor's kid, being a minor, would typically have his parents responsible. The fact that the parents offered to pay at the time but the author's parents dismissed it might complicate things. But the author is now seeking compensation, which could be seen as reasonable because the damage wasn't their fault and they're out of pocket.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents might have resolved the issue in good faith, and the author coming back to demand money after the fact could be seen as a breach of that resolution. The key points here are: Did the author know about the incident immediately? Did the parents already handle it? If the parents accepted the apology and dismissed the payment, maybe the author is now bringing it up later, which could make some people think he's overstepping. But the author didn't know about the damage until returning, so he wasn't part of the initial resolution.\n\nAlso, the author's parents didn't inform him, which is a bit strange. They might have thought it was resolved, but they have a duty to inform their child about such significant damage. The neighbor's family might feel they already took responsibility by apologizing and offering payment, but if the parents didn't accept that offer, the author could have a case. However, if the parents accepted the apology and said it's okay, maybe the author's request is now too late.\n\nBut legally, the responsibility still lies with the at-fault party. So even if the parents dismissed it, the author might have a right to pursue compensation. The problem here is more about the social dynamics: the author is being criticized for seeking reimbursement after the initial resolution. But ethically, if the author's parents didn't clarify that they weren't accepting the offer, maybe the author is in the right to now seek payment because he's the one who has to pay for the repairs.\n\nSo, putting this together: the author didn't know about the damage until returning, and the responsible parties only offered to pay when the owner wasn't present. The parents might have thought it was sorted, but the owner is now facing the financial burden. The author is justified in seeking reimbursement because the damage wasn't his fault, and the initial resolution might not have been valid without his consent. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
