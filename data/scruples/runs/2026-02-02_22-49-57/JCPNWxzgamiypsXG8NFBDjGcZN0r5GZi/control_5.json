Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is the asshole for wanting reimbursement after their neighbor's kid damaged their car. The car was parked at the parent's house while they were in Germany. The kid hit the car, offered to pay, but the parents said not to worry about it. Now the author is upset because they weren't informed and aren't getting compensation.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are: the kid was at fault for damaging the car. The parents of the kid were there and the kid offered to pay, but the parents dismissed it. The author wasn't informed and now has to pay for repairs. \n\nThe author's main grievances are not being told about the incident and not receiving compensation. The neighbor's parents and the author's parents told them to let it go. But legally, when someone causes damage, they are responsible for it unless the owner waives that responsibility. The author's parents might have done that by saying not to worry about it, but the author is the car's owner. They might have a right to seek compensation, even if their parents initially let it go. \n\nHowever, in some jurisdictions, if the owner (or a representative) accepts the apology and says not to worry about it, that could be considered a release of liability. But the author wasn't there, so their parents might not have the authority to make that decision. Plus, the author is now facing unexpected expenses. \n\nThe neighbors might be in the wrong because their kid caused damage and should cover the costs. The author's parents might have mishandled the situation by not informing the actual owner. The author isn't the one who caused the damage, so they aren't the asshole. The neighbors and their parents are, perhaps, in the wrong for not informing the author and not compensating them.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The responsibility lies with the person who caused the damage.\n"
