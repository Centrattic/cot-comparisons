Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that their neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were away. The kid and his parents went to the author's parents' house, apologized, and the parents told them not to worry about it. When the author returns, they find the damage and want reimbursement. Everyone else, including their parents, is telling them to let it go, but the author feels wronged.\n\nFirst, I need to assess legal responsibility. In most places, when someone damages your property, they are legally responsible for covering the costs. The kid is a minor, so his parents would typically be liable. The fact that the kid offered to pay but the parents dismissed the issue complicates things. However, the parents' decision to not pursue compensation doesn't absolve the responsible party. The author is the actual victim here, so they have a right to seek reimbursement regardless of what their parents decided.\n\nNext, the social aspect. The author's parents and others are advising them to let it go. But the author is being reasonable in wanting compensation for their loss. It's understandable that they're upset about not being informed and having to bear the financial burden. The kid and his parents should have informed the car owner immediately, even if they offered to pay. The fact that the damage was done and not communicated makes the situation worse for the kid's side.\n\nAlso, minors are generally not held fully responsible for damages, so the parents have a duty to cover it. The parents' reaction seems to be avoiding responsibility, which is why the author is in the right to seek compensation. The author isn't overreacting; they're standing up for their rights. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
