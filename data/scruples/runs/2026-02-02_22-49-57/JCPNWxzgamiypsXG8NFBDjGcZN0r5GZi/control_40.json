Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit the author's parked car while they were abroad. The parents of the kid and the author's parents were involved, and the author's parents told them not to worry about it. Now, the author is upset because they weren't informed and there's no compensation.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is at fault. The kid hit the car, which is their responsibility. The parents of the kid were worried about being blamed, but the author's parents dismissed it. The author is now asking for reimbursement, but others think he's overreacting.\n\nLegally, the kid's family is responsible because the damage was caused by their child. The author isn't at fault for not being present. However, the parents might have handled the situation without the owner's knowledge, which could be a point. The author's parents might have been too quick to dismiss the issue, but that doesn't make the author wrong in seeking compensation now.\n\nMorally, the kid and his parents should have informed the car owner. The author's parents might have acted out of kindness, but the author has a right to seek reimbursement. The key points are that the damage was done, and the responsible party (the kid) should cover the costs. The author isn't being unreasonable here. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
