Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The parents were there and met the kid and his parents. The kid offered to pay, but the parents were told not to worry about it. Now, when the author returns and finds out about the damage, he wants reimbursement, but everyone else thinks he's overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about responsibility and communication. The kid caused damage. In most places, the responsible party should cover the costs unless it's a minor incident. The parents of the kid were involved, and the author's parents initially let it go. But the author wasn't informed at all. \n\nWhen the car owner isn't present, the person who caused the damage has a duty to inform the owner and arrange compensation. Even if the kid and his parents tried to resolve it with the author's parents, the author is the actual owner. The parents might have been mistaken in dismissing it. The author's parents might not have the authority to waive the claim, especially since the car is the author's. The author isn't in the wrong for seeking reimbursement for his own property. Others might think he's being harsh, but he's not the one who caused the damage. The kid's side failed to communicate properly with the owner, which is a problem.\n\nSo, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. The responsibility lies with the person who caused the damage to notify the owner and compensate them. The author's parents shouldn't have dismissed the issue without consulting him, the actual owner.\n"
