Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves a neighbor's kid hitting the author's parked car while they were abroad. The kid and his parents approached the author's parents, apologized, and offered to pay, but the parents dismissed it. Now the author is upset because they weren't informed and are expected to cover the $1000 damage themselves.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, when someone causes damage to another's property, they're generally liable for the damages. The kid is 16, so the responsibility might fall on his parents. The fact that the parents were involved in the initial resolution attempt is important. They were upset about the author's family possibly calling the police or filing a claim, but the author's parents told them not to worry. However, the author wasn't consulted, and they're now facing the financial burden.\n\nEthically, the author's parents might have intended to handle it amicably, but they didn't consider the owner's perspective. The author has a right to know about the damage and to seek compensation. The neighbors' offer to pay was made, but the author's family dismissed it, which leaves the author in a tough spot. The author isn't overreacting because they're the one who has to pay for the repairs. The neighbors, on the other hand, might be avoiding responsibility by saying \"these things happen\" when they were actually at fault.\n\nThe key points here are the lack of communication and the failure to resolve the issue properly. The author isn't to blame for the accident itself or for seeking reimbursement. The responsibility lies with the person who caused the damage and their parents who didn't follow through on the resolution. So, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
