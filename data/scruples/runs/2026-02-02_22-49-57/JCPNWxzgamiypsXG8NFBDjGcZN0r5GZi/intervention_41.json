Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation where a neighbor's kid hit their car while they were away. The author returned to find $1,000 worth of damage and no compensation, and everyone says they're the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. The kid, 16 years old, hit the car while the owner was abroad. The parents came over to the parent's house and were told not to worry about it. The kid apologized and offered to pay, but the parents said not to worry. Now the author is upset about not being informed and not getting compensated. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nSo, legally, if a minor causes damage to someone's property, the parents are usually liable. The kid offered to pay, but the parents might not have followed through. However, in this case, the parents were the ones who told the neighbor's parents not to worry about it. So the author's parents might have forgiven the debt. But the issue is that the author wasn't consulted. The parents made that decision without the owner's input. \n\nFrom a responsibility standpoint, the neighbor's parents might be at fault for not ensuring the damage was properly resolved. If the parents of the kid told them not to worry about it, but the kid is a minor, the legal responsibility falls on the parents. However, if the author's parents accepted the apology and waived the payment, maybe there's an assumption that the matter was settled. But since the author wasn't part of that conversation and now is being told not to seek reimbursement, it's a conflict between the parents' decision and the owner's rights.\n\nMorally, the author is upset because they had to pay for damages that weren't their fault. The neighbor's family might argue that they resolved it by apologizing and offering payment, but the author's parents dismissed it. The author is now being blamed for wanting compensation. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author isn't at fault for the accident. The neighbor's family caused the damage and didn't inform them. The parents might have overstepped by not involving the owner in the decision. So the author's request for reimbursement is reasonable, especially since they weren't part of the initial resolution. \n\nHowever, some people might argue that since the parents forgave the debt, the author shouldn't be upset. But the author didn't agree to that. The problem is the parents making decisions without their input. So the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to seek compensation, given that they were not informed and the damage is their financial burden.\n"
