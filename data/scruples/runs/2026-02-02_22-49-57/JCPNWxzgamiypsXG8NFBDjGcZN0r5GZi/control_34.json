Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were in Germany. The parents were informed, the kid apologized and offered to pay, but the parents said not to worry about it. The author comes back to find out about the damage and is upset about not being informed and not getting compensation. Others think the author is overreacting.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect: in most places, if someone causes damage, they're responsible for covering the costs. The kid is a minor, so his parents would be liable. The fact that the kid offered to pay but the parents refused might complicate things. However, the parents might have settled it themselves by saying it's okay, but the original owner (the author) wasn't involved in that decision. \n\nEthically, the parents might have resolved it on their own, but since the car belongs to the author, they have a right to know and to seek compensation. The parents might have dismissed it without considering the owner's perspective. The author's anger is about being kept in the dark and not being compensated, which is understandable.\n\nThe neighbors might not have informed the author because they thought the parents had already handled it. But the parents might have thought the damage was minor or didn't realize the cost. However, the author's right to know about the damage to their property is valid. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the kid is at fault for the accident. The parents might have handled the initial response, but the author has the right to seek reimbursement since it's their car. The fact that others think the author is the asshole might stem from the parents already trying to resolve it, but the author's perspective is also valid because they weren't part of that resolution.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a right to be informed about damage to their property and to seek compensation. The neighbors and parents might have thought it was resolved, but the author's reaction is reasonable given the financial impact. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
