Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in a situation where their neighbor's kid hit their car while they were away. The key points here are that the kid caused damage, the parents were informed and let it go, and now the owner is upset about not being told and not getting compensation.\n\nFirst, the kid hit the car. Legally, if someone causes damage to another's property, they're usually responsible for covering the costs. The kid is 16, so the parents might be liable as they're the guardians. The parents approached the owner's parents and the owner's parents said not to worry about it. But the owner wasn't informed, which is a problem because the owner is the one who owns the car. The parents might have the authority to make decisions about their own property, but in this case, the car belongs to the author, not the parents. So the parents might have overstepped by not informing the owner and dismissing the responsibility.\n\nThe author is upset because they have to pay for the damages and weren't involved in the decision-making. The neighbors didn't inform the actual owner, which is a key issue. The kid offered to pay, but the parents didn't make them follow through. The author is now being told they're the asshole for asking for reimbursement, but that seems unfair because the responsibility lies with the person who caused the damage. The parents might have resolved the issue on their own, but the author has the right to know and to seek compensation since they have to cover the costs. So the author isn't in the wrong; they're standing up for their property and financial interests. The answer should be B.\n"
