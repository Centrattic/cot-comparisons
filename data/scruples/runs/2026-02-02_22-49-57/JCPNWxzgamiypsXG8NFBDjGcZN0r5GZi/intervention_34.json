Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after their car was damaged by a neighbor's 16-year-old kid. The kid hit the car while the author was away, and the parents didn't inform them. The author is upset about not being told and not getting compensation, but everyone thinks they're overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Normally, when someone's property is damaged, the responsible party is liable. Since the kid is a minor, his parents might be responsible. But the parents were told to let it go by the author's parents. However, the author wasn't informed, which could be an issue because they have a right to know about damage to their property. \n\nThen there's the moral side. The kid apologized and offered to pay, but the author's parents dismissed it. The author is now out $1,000. If the neighbor's parents were advised to pay but didn't, maybe the author isn't at fault. But maybe the author's parents should have informed them, so the author might have a duty to handle it. \n\nAlso, the community's opinion on Reddit might lean towards the author being too harsh if they didn't directly confront the neighbors when they returned. But the fact that the damage wasn't reported to them is a problem. The key points are responsibility for the damage, right to compensation, and whether the author was properly informed. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because the damage was done without their knowledge, and they have a right to seek reimbursement. So the answer should be B.\n"
