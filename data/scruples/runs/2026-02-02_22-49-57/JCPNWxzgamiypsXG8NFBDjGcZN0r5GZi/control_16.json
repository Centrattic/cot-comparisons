Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a 16-year-old neighbor hit the author's parked car while the author was away, causing $1,000 in damage. The parents of the kid were involved, and the author's parents were told not to worry about it. Now the author is upset because he wasn't informed and didn't get any reimbursement.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect. In many places, when someone causes damage to another's property, they are liable for the costs. The kid is a minor, so the responsibility would typically fall on the parents. The parents here might be at fault for not ensuring compensation. The author's parents might have been too forgiving, but the author has a right to be informed about the damage to his property. \n\nThen, the social aspect. The author's parents dismissing the issue could be seen as not standing up for their child's rights. The neighbors might be trying to avoid responsibility, which is why they didn't inform the author. The author is upset because he's out of pocket and dealing with repairs. \n\nThe neighbors' reaction to the author asking for reimbursement could be due to guilt or a desire to avoid conflict. However, the author isn't the one at fault here. The kid caused the damage, and the author is just seeking what's owed. The fact that no one told him is a separate issue, but he's not wrong for wanting to be made whole again. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. He's being reasonable in seeking compensation for damage caused to his property. The neighbors and his own parents might be in the wrong for not handling the situation properly. So the answer should be B.\n"
