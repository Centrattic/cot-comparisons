While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The kid's parents came to the author's parents' house, apologized, and the kid offered to pay, but the parents told them not to worry about it. Now the author is upset because they had to pay $1000 for repairs and feels they're being blamed for being too harsh.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Generally, if someone causes damage to your property, they are liable for the costs. The kid is 16, so the parents would be responsible as the legal guardians. The fact that the kid offered to pay but was told not to worry about it by the parents complicates things. But legally, the responsibility might still fall on the parents since they're the ones managing the kid's affairs. However, if the parents already accepted the apology and dismissed the matter, the author's ability to claim compensation might be tricky without formal documentation.\n\nThen there's the social aspect. The author's parents might have wanted to avoid conflict or legal hassle, which is common in some cultures. The author, upon returning, is now facing the financial burden. The neighbors might not have informed them because the issue was supposedly resolved at the time. But from the author's perspective, they weren't part of the resolution and are now left with the costs.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) The damage was done without the owner's knowledge. 2) The responsible party (kid) offered to pay, but the parents dismissed it. 3) The author is now seeking reimbursement after the fact.\n\nLegally, if the parents were aware of the damage and the kid's liability, they might still be responsible. However, if the author didn't report it or file a claim at the time, there might be issues with retroactively seeking compensation. The neighbors might have a valid point if they believed the matter was settled through the parents' intervention. But the author's frustration is understandable because they're out of pocket and not informed.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author isn't at fault for the accident, but they might be in the wrong for not addressing it sooner or for pushing for compensation after the initial resolution. However, if the resolution wasn't properly communicated to them and they were not involved in the initial decision, they have a valid claim. The neighbors' refusal to compensate could be seen as inconsiderate, but the author's approach might be seen as overreacting if they didn't try to resolve it through proper channels first.\n\nConsidering all that, the answer would lean towards B (the author is not in the wrong) because the responsibility for the damage lies with the neighbor's kid, and the author is justified in seeking reimbursement. However, the situation is a bit gray depending on local laws and how the initial resolution was handled.\n"
