Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the neighbor kid hit the author's parked car when the author was away. The kid and his mom went to the author's parents' house, apologized, and offered to pay, but the parents waved it off. Now the author comes back to find out about the damage and is upset because no one told him and there's no compensation. He's being told he's the asshole for wanting reimbursement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, if someone damages your property, they are responsible for covering the costs unless there's some sort of agreement. The kid is 16, so his parents might be legally responsible. The parents did offer to pay initially but the author's parents dismissed it. But the author is the actual owner of the car, so he might have a right to seek compensation even if his parents said not to worry. The problem is that the author wasn't informed, which is a key point. The parents should have informed him about the incident.\n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The author had to pay $1,000 out of pocket. Even if the parents forgave the debt, the author is now bearing the financial loss. The kid's family might have offered to pay, but since the author's parents didn't inform him, he's left in the dark. The author isn't overreacting because he's the one who has to cover the costs. The others are saying to let it go, but that doesn't consider the author's financial burden.\n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong because he's the rightful owner of the car and should have been informed. The kid's family is at fault for causing the damage, and the author's parents didn't inform him properly. The author's desire for reimbursement is reasonable here. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
