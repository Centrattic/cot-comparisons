Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in the given situation. Let me read through the scenario again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nSo, the author left their car parked at their parents' house while they were abroad in Germany for three months. A 16-year-old neighbor kid backed into the car, causing $1,000 in damage. The kid and his mom went to the parents' house after the incident. The parents told them not to worry about it, and the kid apologized and offered to pay, but the parents apparently dismissed it. Now the author comes back, finds out about the damage, and is upset because they weren't informed and there's no compensation. They're being told by everyone, including their parents, that they're the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n\nThe user's opinion is that the author isn't in the wrong, but they want others' thoughts. The question is whether the author is in the wrong, with options A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, let's break down the responsibilities here. The kid was at fault for hitting the car. Legally, the responsible party (the kid's family) should cover the damages. However, the parents of the car owner chose not to pursue it, even though the kid offered to pay. Now the author is upset because they're left with the cost.\n\nThe key points here are:\n1. The kid caused the damage and should be responsible for it.\n2. The parents of the car owner didn't inform the author about the incident and dismissed the responsibility.\n3. The author is now seeking reimbursement, which others are calling out as being the asshole.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the responsible party (the neighbor's family) is obligated to pay for damages caused by their child. The parents of the car owner might have waived that right by not informing the author and allowing the kid's family to avoid payment. However, the author is the actual owner, so they might have the right to pursue compensation regardless of what their parents did.\n\nEthically, the author is in a tough spot. They weren't present, their parents handled the situation without their input, and now they're left with the financial burden. The neighbor's family had the opportunity to address the issue but didn't, and the author's parents didn't inform them. The author is justified in wanting compensation for their property, which was damaged by someone else's negligence.\n\nOn the other hand, the neighbors might argue that they resolved the issue by the kid apologizing and the author's parents forgiving the debt. But if the parents didn't inform the author, then the author wasn't part of that agreement. The parents might have overstepped by assuming the author wouldn't want to pursue the matter.\n\nIn terms of social norms, sometimes people expect others to let minor incidents go, especially if the responsible party is a minor. However, $1,000 is a significant amount, and it's reasonable for the author to want to be reimbursed. The problem is that the author's parents didn't handle the communication properly, leading to the author being in the dark.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a legitimate claim for compensation since their property was damaged. The neighbors and their parents should have informed the actual owner and addressed the financial responsibility. The author's parents' actions might have contributed to the confusion, but that doesn't make the author wrong for seeking what they're owed.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
