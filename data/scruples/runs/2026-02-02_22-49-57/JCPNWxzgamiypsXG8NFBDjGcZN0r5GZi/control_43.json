Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The kid and his parents went to the author's parents, apologized, and maybe offered to pay, but the parents said not to worry. Now the author is upset because they weren't informed and have to pay $1,000 in damages.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, if someone damages your car, they're responsible for the damages. The kid is 16, so his parents might be liable. But the parents might have resolved it with the author's parents. However, the author's parents are the ones who interacted with the neighbors, not the author themselves. The author wasn't there, so maybe they have a right to be informed.\n\nEmotionally, the author is upset because they had to pay a lot. The neighbors didn't tell them about the incident, which seems like a big oversight. The author's parents might have handled it, but the author is the car owner, so should have been involved. It's possible the parents thought they could handle it without involving the kid's family, but maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nAlso, the neighbors might have a legal responsibility to compensate. If the kid was at fault, the parents should cover it. The author's parents might not have the right to waive that on behalf of the author. So the author is justified in seeking reimbursement, even if their parents told them not to worry about it. The author's parents might be in the wrong for not informing them. \n\nThe community's reaction says the author is the asshole, but that might be because they think it's resolved through the parents. However, legally and ethically, the person whose car was damaged deserves compensation. The author isn't wrong for asking for it.\n"
