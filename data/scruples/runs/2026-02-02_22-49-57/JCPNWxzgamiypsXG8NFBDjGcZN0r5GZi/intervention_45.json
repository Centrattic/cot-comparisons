Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation involves a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hitting the author's parked car while they were away in Germany. The parents of the kid were present when the incident happened and were told by the author's parents not to worry about it. The author returns to find damage and is upset because they weren't informed and there's no compensation. Everyone else thinks the author is overreacting.\n\nSo, first, legal responsibility. In many places, if someone under 18 causes damage, their parents are legally responsible. The kid here is 16, so liability likely falls on the parents. The author's parents didn't inform them, which might be part of the issue. The author's parents told the other parents not to worry, but maybe they shouldn't have dismissed the situation, considering the owner's rights.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, their car was damaged without their knowledge, and they're being told to accept it. The key points are: the damage was done, the owner wasn't informed, and the responsible party's parents were told not to pay. The author is now seeking reimbursement, which is a reasonable request given that the damage wasn't their fault.\n\nOthers might argue that the author's parents handled it by forgiving the debt, so the author shouldn't be upset. But the author wasn't involved in that decision. They're the ones who have to pay for repairs. The parents might have overstepped by not consulting the owner.\n\nSo, considering the situation, the author is not in the wrong. They're being asked to take responsibility for something they didn't do. The responsible parties (the kid and his parents) should cover the costs. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
