Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The scenario is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit the author's parked car while the author was in Germany for three months. The parents were present and interacted with the neighbor kid and his mother. The kid apologized and offered to pay, but the parents told them not to worry about it. Now, when the author returns, there's $1,000 damage, and he's upset because he wasn't informed and there's no compensation. People are telling him he's the asshole for seeking reimbursement.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong here. The key points are: the car was parked at the parents' house, the kid hit it, parents handled the situation by not pressing charges, but the author feels wronged because he wasn't told and is now out $1,000. \n\nThe main question is about responsibility. Legally, when someone damages another's property, they're usually responsible for repairs. However, the parents might have acted on the author's behalf. But the author wasn't present, so did he have the right to expect his parents to handle it? The parents might have tried to resolve it amicably, but if the kid's family didn't actually pay, then maybe the author is justified in seeking compensation now.\n\nBut the problem is that the author wasn't informed. His parents might have thought it was resolved, but they didn't communicate with him. The neighbor kid's family might have agreed to pay but didn't, or the parents might have forgiven the debt. However, the author is now out money because he wasn't part of the conversation. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the kid is at fault for causing the damage. The parents might have the authority to handle matters related to the car since it's their house. But the author is the owner of the car, so he might have a right to expect reimbursement. However, if the parents already handled it (even if they didn't follow through), maybe the author is overstepping by now asking for money after the fact. \n\nBut if the parents didn't actually secure payment and just told the neighbor family not to worry about it, then the author is left out of pocket. The kid's responsibility to reimburse the owner exists regardless of the parents' actions. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for expecting reimbursement now, knowing that his parents didn't press the issue. Alternatively, maybe the parents should have informed him, and he has a right to pursue the matter because he owns the car. \n\nIn terms of legal liability, the kid's family would be responsible for damages. If the parents let the matter drop without ensuring payment, the author might still have a right to seek compensation from them. However, since the parents are the ones who interacted, they might have the authority to forgive the debt. But that's between the parents and the neighbor family, not the author. \n\nSo, the author isn't at fault for wanting to be compensated for damage that wasn't his fault. The parents might have made a mistake by not handling the payment, but that doesn't absolve the neighbor's family of their responsibility. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for seeking reimbursement in this case. The answer would be B (No).\n"
