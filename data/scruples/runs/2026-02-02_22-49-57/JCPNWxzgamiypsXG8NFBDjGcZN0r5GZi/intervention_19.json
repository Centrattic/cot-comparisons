Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The kid and his parents went to the author's parents' house, apologized, and offered to pay, but the parents said not to worry about it. Now the author is upset because they had to pay $1000 out of pocket and no one told them. They're being told they're the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, if someone damages your property, they are legally responsible for covering the costs. Even minors can be held responsible if their guardians are aware. The kid's parents were present, so they might be liable. The parents not informing the car owner about the damage or the incident could be an issue. The author's parents might have overstepped by not informing them and dismissing the matter.\n\nEthically, the author is trying to recover their loss, which is reasonable. The kid did cause damage, and expecting reimbursement isn't unreasonable. The fact that the parents didn't communicate with the actual owner (the author) is a problem. The author's parents might have a different view, but the author has a right to be informed and to seek compensation.\n\nAlso, the author was abroad, so they couldn't have known about the incident until returning. The lack of communication from the neighbor's family and the author's parents is a key point. The author isn't overreacting by wanting to be compensated for a damage they didn't cause. The neighbors should have informed them and resolved it properly.\n\nSo, considering both legal responsibility and ethical responsibility, the author isn't in the wrong. The neighbors (both the kid and their parents) are responsible for the damage. The author's parents might have made a mistake by not informing them and not ensuring compensation. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
