Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in a situation where a neighbor's kid damaged their car while they were away. The key points are: the kid hit the car, the parents were informed, they were told not to worry about it, and now the author is upset about not getting reimbursement. \n\nFirst, the kid is 16, so a minor. His parents were involved when the incident happened. The parents apparently told them not to worry about it. The author's parents also said the same. The author is now upset because he had to pay for repairs and feels he should be reimbursed.\n\nLegally, the parents of the minor might be responsible for the damages since the kid is a minor. But if they were told not to worry about it, maybe there's an agreement. However, the author wasn't informed, which is a problem. The parents who owned the car (the author's parents) might have the right to forgive the debt, but the author is the one who had to pay for repairs when he returned. \n\nEthically, the parents might have dismissed it, but the author is the one who's out money. The neighbors might have no obligation if the parents said it's okay, but the author is the car owner. The neighbor's family might have a duty to compensate the actual owner, not just the parents. \n\nSo, the author isn't wrong for seeking reimbursement. The neighbors might have a responsibility to pay him directly since he's the car owner. The parents might have thought they were handling it, but the author has a right to be compensated. Therefore, the answer is B (author not in the wrong).\n"
