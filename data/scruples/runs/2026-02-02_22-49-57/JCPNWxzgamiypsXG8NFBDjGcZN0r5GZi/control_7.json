Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's kid hit their parked car while they were abroad, causing $1000 in damage. The kid and his mom went to the parents' house, apologized, and the parents told them not to worry about it. The author returns to find the damage and is upset because no one told him and there's no compensation. He's being told he's the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if someone causes damage to another's property, they are responsible for covering the costs unless there's a valid reason not to. However, in this case, the parents of the kid decided to let it go. But the car owner (the author) wasn't there to make that decision. The parents didn't inform him, so he's out of the loop. Ethically, the kid is at fault for causing damage. The parents might have forgiven the cost, but the author is the one who should be consulted since it's his property and he's the one facing the financial loss. \n\nThe author's parents might have acted out of a desire to avoid conflict, but they didn't have the authority to absolve the financial responsibility. The kid's parents might have thought they were resolving it, but the author is now stuck with the bill. The author is upset because he's the one who has to pay and deal with the repairs. The fact that he's trying to get reimbursement isn't unreasonable; the person who caused the damage should be responsible. \n\nHowever, some might argue that since the parents already handled it and the kid is a minor, maybe the author should have known beforehand or the parents shouldn't be blamed. But the key point is that the author wasn't informed, and his property was damaged. The responsibility for the damage lies with the person who caused it, so the author isn't wrong in seeking compensation. The people telling him to forget it might not be considering his financial burden. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. He's standing up for his rights as the car owner. The answer should be B (No).\n"
