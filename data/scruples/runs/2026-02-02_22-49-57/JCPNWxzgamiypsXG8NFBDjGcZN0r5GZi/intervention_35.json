Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is that the neighbor's kid hit the author's parked car while they were abroad. The parents were there and the kid offered to pay, but the parents dismissed it. Now the author is upset because no one told them about the damage and there's no compensation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, if someone damages another person's property, they are legally responsible for the damages. Even if the owner isn't present, the person who caused the damage should inform the owner. Here, the kid is 16, which is a minor, so the parents would be liable. The kid did apologize and offer to pay, but the parents refused to let them pay. However, the parents of the car owner also said not to worry about it. But legally, the responsible party (the kid's parents) should cover the costs. \n\nThe author's problem is that they weren't informed and are now out $1,000. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for asking for reimbursement. The parents of the car owner might have tried to resolve it on their own but didn't inform their child. However, the author wasn't consulted and had no say in the matter. \n\nEthically, the author has a right to expect that if their property is damaged, they should be informed and compensated. The fact that the parents of the kid dismissed it doesn't negate the author's right to seek compensation. The author isn't being unreasonable here. The neighbors might think the author is overreacting, but they're the ones who caused the damage. \n\nSo putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The responsible party is the kid and his parents, and the author is justified in seeking reimbursement. The answer should be B (No).\n"
