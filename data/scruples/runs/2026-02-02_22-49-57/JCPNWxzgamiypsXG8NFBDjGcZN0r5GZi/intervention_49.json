Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were away. The parents of the kid were there and the author's parents initially said it's okay. Now the author is upset because they had to pay $1k and everyone thinks they're overreacting. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants to know what others think.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the key points. The kid caused damage, the parents were present, and the author's parents let it go. The author is now being blamed for asking for reimbursement. Legally, if a minor causes damage, their parents are usually responsible. So the kid's parents should cover the cost. But the author's parents let it slide, maybe out of kindness or not wanting to cause trouble. However, the author isn't the one who forgave the debt; they weren't even present. The parents might have overstepped by making that decision without consulting the car owner. \n\nThe author's parents might have acted in good faith, thinking it's a minor incident or not wanting to burden the other parents. But the author is now stuck with the financial burden, which isn't fair. The kid did damage someone's property, and the responsible parties (the kid's parents) should be liable. The author isn't wrong for seeking reimbursement because they were the victim. The fact that the other parents were upset about being reported suggests they might be aware of their liability. \n\nSo, the author is justified in asking for compensation. They weren't present and couldn't have handled it themselves. Their parents made a decision that affected the author's property. The author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B (No). But I need to make sure there's no local laws that might affect this. Since it's in the US, typically parents are responsible for their minor's actions. So yes, the author isn't wrong.\n"
