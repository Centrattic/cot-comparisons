Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's kid hit their parked car while they were abroad, causing $1,000 in damages. The kid and his parents approached the author's parents, apologized, and offered to pay, but the parents told them not to worry about it. Now the author is upset because they weren't informed and there's no compensation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Generally, when someone damages another person's property, they are responsible for the damages. Even if the parents initially accepted the apology and said not to worry, the actual car owner (the author) is the one who's out of pocket. The parents might have resolved it among themselves, but the author is the one facing the financial loss. \n\nThen there's the question of communication. The parents didn't inform the author about the incident until after they returned. That's a problem because the author has a right to know about the damage to their property. The parents might have tried to handle it, but they should have kept the author in the loop.\n\nAlso, the age of the kid is 16. In many places, a minor causing damage would have their parents responsible for the damages. So legally, the parents should cover the costs. The fact that they offered to pay but the author's parents dismissed it doesn't absolve them of responsibility. The author is the rightful owner, so they have a valid claim.\n\nLooking at the community reaction, everyone is telling the author to let it go, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong. Emotional support from others doesn't override legal rights. The author's frustration is justified because they have to pay for something not their fault.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author isn't in the wrong. They have a right to seek reimbursement since they're the ones bearing the financial burden. The parents' handling of the situation was flawed, and the author's anger is reasonable given the circumstances. The answer should be B.\n"
