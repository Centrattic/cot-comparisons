Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a neighbor kid hitting their parked car while they were abroad. The author is upset because they weren't informed and now have to pay $1,000 in damages. They're being told they're the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. The car was parked at the author's parents' house. The neighbor's 16-year-old kid backed into it. The kid and his mom went to the parents' house, the kid apologized and offered to pay. The parents said not to worry about it. The author comes back and finds out about the damage, is upset because no one told him, and wants compensation. Everyone else tells him to let it go.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't, but wants confirmation. Let's look at the legal and ethical aspects here. Legally, if a kid causes damage, is the parent responsible? In many places, parents might be liable for their minor children's actions, especially if the kid is a minor. So the author has a right to seek compensation. However, the parents might have accepted the apology and waived the claim, but the author wasn't part of that conversation. \n\nEthically, did the parents overstep by not informing the car owner? The author's parents might have tried to resolve it themselves, but the car is the author's, so they should have informed him. The author is now being blamed for \"overreacting,\" but they have a right to be upset about financial loss. \n\nAnother angle: the kid might be responsible, but since he's a minor, the parents would handle the reimbursement. The fact that the kid offered to pay but the parents said not to worry about it doesn't absolve them of responsibility. If the parents had the authority to waive the claim, maybe, but if the car is the author's, the parents might not have the right to do that without consulting the owner. \n\nSo, putting this together, the author is not in the wrong for seeking reimbursement. The parents might have mishandled the situation by not informing the owner and not allowing him to make a decision. The kid's family should have handled it properly, and the author's reaction is reasonable given the circumstances. The answer should be B (No).\n"
