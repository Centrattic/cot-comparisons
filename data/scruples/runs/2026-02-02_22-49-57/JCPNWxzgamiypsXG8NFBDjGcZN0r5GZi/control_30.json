Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The parents were told by the kid's parents to not worry about it, but the car owner is now upset because they didn't get reimbursed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, if someone's property is damaged, the person responsible is liable for the damages. The kid here is a minor, so his parents would be legally responsible. However, if the parents told the car owner not to worry about it, maybe they didn't want to go through legal steps. But the car owner is now facing the cost.\n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The car owner was away and didn't know about the damage until returning. They're asking for reimbursement, which is understandable. The parents and neighbors think they're overreacting, but the car owner is out $1,000.\n\nThe kid did apologize and offered to pay, but the parents were told not to worry. However, maybe the parents should have insisted on compensation since it's their child's responsibility. Also, not informing the owner about the damage is a problem. The car owner has a right to know about the damage to their property.\n\nSo, the car owner isn't in the wrong here. They're seeking what's right\u2014reimbursement for damage caused by someone else. The fact that they were away and not informed makes it even more about their right to compensation. The answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
