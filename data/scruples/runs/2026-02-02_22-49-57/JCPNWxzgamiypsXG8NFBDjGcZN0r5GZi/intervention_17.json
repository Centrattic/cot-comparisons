Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the given situation. The scenario is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The parents handled it by saying not to worry, but when the author comes back, they're upset about the $1,000 damage and want reimbursement. The question is whether the author is wrong for asking for compensation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. If someone causes damage to property, they are generally responsible for covering the costs. The kid is a minor, so his parents would be liable. The parents might be arguing that they resolved the issue by having the kid apologize, but legally, compensation might still be required unless the owner (the author) accepted it.\n\nThen, there's the social aspect. The author's parents dismissed the incident, possibly to avoid conflict. But the author is now out of pocket and feels wronged. The neighbors might not have informed the author because they thought it was handled, but that's on them. The author isn't at fault for seeking what is rightfully theirs. \n\nAlso, the parents might have made a decision without consulting the author, which is a problem. They should have informed the author about the incident and the lack of compensation. The author's reaction is understandable given the financial loss. The neighbors' response of \"these things happen\" doesn't absolve them of responsibility.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong for asking for reimbursement. The fault lies with the neighbor's kid and parents for causing the damage and not compensating properly. The author's parents made a decision without considering the owner's perspective. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
