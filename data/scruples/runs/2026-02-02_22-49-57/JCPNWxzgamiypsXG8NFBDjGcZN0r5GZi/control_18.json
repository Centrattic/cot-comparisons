Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user's question is whether the author is in the wrong after their neighbor's kid damaged their car while they were away. The key points here are: the kid hit the car, the parents were informed, they were told not to worry, and now the author is upset about not being reimbursed. \n\nFirst, the kid is 16, which is a minor. Typically, minors aren't held fully responsible for damages, so the parents would be liable. The kid did offer to pay, but the parents told them not to worry. However, the author wasn't told about the incident until returning home. \n\nThe author's parents might have thought it's a family matter and chose to handle it informally. But the author, as the car owner, has a right to know about the damage and to seek compensation. The parents' decision not to inform the author could be seen as overstepping, especially since the car belongs to the author, not the parents.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the neighbor's family should cover the damages. The author isn't wrong for seeking reimbursement because the damage wasn't their fault. The issue is the parents not supporting their child in this situation. The author isn't at fault for wanting to be informed and compensated. So, the answer would be B\u2014the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
