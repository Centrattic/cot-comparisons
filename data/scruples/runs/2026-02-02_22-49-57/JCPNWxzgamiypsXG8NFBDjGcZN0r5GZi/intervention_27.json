Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for wanting reimbursement after their neighbor's kid damaged their car. The situation is that the kid hit the car while the author was away, and the parents didn't inform them and dismissed the issue.\n\nFirst, the kid caused the damage. At 16, he's a minor, but parents are usually responsible for their children's actions. The parents were upset about the author's parents not pressing a claim, but the author's parents let it slide. Now the author is coming back and being told to accept it without compensation.\n\nLegally, when someone's property is damaged by another, they have the right to seek compensation. The author's parents might have agreed not to pursue it, but the owner (the author) has the right to seek reimbursement. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting their money back after their car was damaged without their knowledge. The parents might have made a decision, but the author has the right to be informed and to seek restitution. So the answer is B.\n"
