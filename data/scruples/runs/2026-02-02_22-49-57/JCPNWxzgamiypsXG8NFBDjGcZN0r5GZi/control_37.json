Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user's situation is that their neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The kid and his mom went to the parent's house, and the parents didn't tell the user about the damage and accepted the kid's apology without any reimbursement. Now the user is upset because they have to pay for the repairs and feels everyone is blaming them for overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about responsibility and communication. The kid caused damage, which is their fault. However, the parents (the author's parents) were present and apparently let it go without informing the author. The author is now upset because they didn't know and aren't getting compensation.\n\nLegally, if a minor causes damage, their parents are usually responsible. The parents here might have the duty to cover the costs. The author's parents, by not informing them, might have overstepped by deciding the matter without consulting the car owner. The author has the right to know about the damage to their property and seek compensation, even if their parents tried to handle it. The fact that the kid and his parents were told not to worry about it doesn't absolve them legally or morally from the responsibility. \n\nThe author isn't the one who caused the damage, so they aren't at fault. The parents' decision to not inform the author and let it slide could be seen as their mistake, but the author is justified in wanting reimbursement. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer would be B (No) because the author is not responsible for the accident. The responsibility lies with the kid and his parents.\n"
