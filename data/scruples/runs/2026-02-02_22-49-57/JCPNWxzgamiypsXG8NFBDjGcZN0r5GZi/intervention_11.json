Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong when their neighbor's kid damaged their car while they were abroad, and the author is upset because they weren't informed and no compensation was offered.\n\nFirst, the situation: The neighbor kid, 16 years old, backed into the car. His parents and the author's parents met to resolve it. The kid apologized and offered to pay, but the author's parents said not to worry about it. The author came back to find the damage and is now seeking reimbursement, but everyone's telling him not to make a big deal about it.\n\nSo, the key points here are about responsibility and communication. The kid caused the damage, so the parents might be liable since he's a minor. The author's parents, however, forgave the debt and told them not to worry. Now the author is upset because he isn't being compensated for the $1,000. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a legal standpoint, if the parents of the kid agreed to cover the damage or let it go, then the author's claim might not hold. But the author's parents were the ones who said not to worry. However, the author wasn't part of the conversation and was kept in the dark. \n\nMoral perspective: The author is entitled to know about the damage and to seek compensation. The fact that the kid apologized and offered to pay suggests he acknowledges responsibility, but the author's parents dismissed the issue. The author is within their rights to want reimbursement, especially if the kid's family could afford it. But the author's parents handled it without involving him, which complicates things. \n\nPossible angles to consider: Did the author's parents have the authority to dismiss the claim? Since the car belonged to the author, maybe they didn't. Also, the neighbor's family might be in the wrong for not informing the car owner. If the author's parents were complicit in not telling him, does that make him an asshole for being upset? Or is it their fault for not handling the matter properly?\n\nAlso, the kid is a minor, so his parents are responsible. The author is in the right to ask for compensation. The author's parents might have let it slide for peace, but the author's right to know the damage was done is separate. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting reimbursement. The main issue is the lack of communication and the parents' handling of the situation without the owner's consent. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
