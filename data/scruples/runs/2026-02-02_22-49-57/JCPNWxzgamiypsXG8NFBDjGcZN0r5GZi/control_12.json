Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's kid hit their parked car while they were abroad, and the parents and others think the author is the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. The kid was 16, so a minor. The incident happened when the car owner was in Germany. The kid and his mom went to the parents' house, apologized, and offered to pay, but the parents said not to worry. The car owner found out about the damage upon returning and is upset about the $1,000 cost. People are telling them to just forget it, but they feel wronged.\n\nNow, legalese-wise, if someone's property is damaged, they have a right to seek compensation. However, the parents and the neighbor might have resolved it already. But the car owner wasn't informed. That's a problem because they're the rightful owner. The parents might have settled it, but the car owner has the right to know. Also, the neighbor's family might have agreed to pay, but the payment wasn't made, so the author is trying to get the reimbursement now.\n\nThe key points: The author wasn't told, which is an issue because they're the one responsible for the car. The neighbor's family might have agreed to pay, but if no payment was made, the author is rightly seeking compensation. The parents might have resolved it without the owner's knowledge, but that's their own decision. The author isn't at fault here because they didn't cause the damage, and it's reasonable to pursue reimbursement. The kid was at fault for hitting the car. The author isn't the asshole; the neighbors (kid and parents) are responsible. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
