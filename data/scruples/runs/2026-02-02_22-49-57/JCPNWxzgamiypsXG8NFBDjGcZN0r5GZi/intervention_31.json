Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The parents were informed and even spoke with the kid and his mom, but they told them not to worry about it. Now the author is upset because they weren't told about the damage and there's no compensation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, if someone causes damage to your property, they're responsible for covering the costs. Since the kid is a minor, his parents would typically be liable. The fact that the parents were informed and told not to worry might complicate things. But legally, the parents might still be responsible, even if they said it's okay. However, the author's own parents didn't inform them, which could affect the situation.\n\nThen there's the moral side. The author is upset because they had to pay for damages they weren't aware of. The neighbor's parents might have resolved the issue between themselves, but the author wasn't part of that. Did the parents have the right to forgive the debt without consulting the car's owner? That's a point of contention here.\n\nAlso, the kid apologized and offered to pay, but the parents declined. If the author's parents accepted the apology and refused compensation, maybe there's an assumption that the matter was settled. But the author wasn't consulted, so they feel wronged. It's like the parents made a decision that affects the author's property without their input.\n\nReddit's role here is to provide a community opinion. From the responses, many might say the author isn't in the wrong because they're the victim of property damage. Others might argue that since the parents handled it, the author overreacts. But legally and morally, the responsible parties (the kid's parents) should cover the costs, even if they were forgiven by the author's parents. However, if the parents already resolved it amicably, the author might not have legal recourse. \n\nBut the key point is that the author wasn't informed. Their parents kept it from them, which is problematic. The author's rights as the car owner were not considered. So, even if the parents let it go, the author is justified in being upset. The kid and his parents should have informed the actual owner. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
