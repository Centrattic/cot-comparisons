Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The kid and his parents were informed, the kid apologized, and the parents were told not to worry about it. Now the author is upset because they find out about the $1,000 damage upon returning and no compensation was arranged. People are telling them they're the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal and social norms. Legally, if a minor causes damage, their parents are usually responsible. Since the kid is 16, he's a minor, so the parents should handle it. The fact that the kid offered to pay but the parents said not to worry about it might complicate things. Did the parents have the authority to waive the author's right to compensation? In some jurisdictions, if a parent allows their child to drive and the child causes damage, the parents can be liable. But if they resolved it themselves without the owner's knowledge, that could be an issue.\n\nSocially, the author is being told to let it go, but they're being asked to absorb a $1,000 cost. That's a significant amount. The author's parents might have done the \"neighborly thing\" by not pressing the issue, but the author is now the one who has to pay. The problem is that the original owner wasn't consulted, so the decision to not seek reimbursement was made without their input. That seems unfair because the author is the one who owns the car and the financial loss affects them directly. \n\nThe kid and his parents might think they resolved it by apologizing, but legally, that doesn't cover the damages. The author has a right to seek compensation for their property. However, if the parents already told the other party not to worry about it, that might create a situation where the author is now going back on that agreement, which could be seen as bad faith. But if the parents didn't own the car and were just holding the author's behalf, their authority to waive the claim might be questionable. \n\nAlso, the kid's parents were upset about being asked to pay, which might indicate they didn't take responsibility. The author's frustration is valid because they weren't informed and now have to pay. The key points are: ownership of the car, whether the parents had the right to dismiss the claim, and the legal responsibility of the kid's parents. \n\nIn many places, you can't just \"let it go\" when someone else's property is damaged; the responsible party should still compensate. So even if the parents said not to worry about it, the author might have a right to pursue the matter once they return. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for seeking reimbursement after the fact. The people telling them they're the asshole are probably not considering the legal aspect and the financial burden on the author.\n"
