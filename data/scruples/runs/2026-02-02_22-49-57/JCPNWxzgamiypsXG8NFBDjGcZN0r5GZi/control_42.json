Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves a neighbor's kid hitting the author's parked car while they were abroad. The parents were present when the kid and his mother came to talk, but they didn't inform the author and let the matter drop. Now the author is upset about the $1,000 damage and wants reimbursement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most places, if someone damages your property, they're responsible for covering the costs. The kid is a minor, so the parents would typically be liable. However, the parents here might have let the kid off the hook by saying not to worry about it. The author wasn't even told, which complicates things because they weren't part of the initial resolution.\n\nThe author's parents might have tried to handle it amicably, but that doesn't absolve the responsible party. The author is now facing financial loss and isn't being supported by their parents to seek reimbursement. The key question is whether the author is in the wrong for seeking compensation after being kept in the dark. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the person who caused the damage should be responsible. The author isn't at fault for the accident itself but is being blamed for wanting to be reimbursed. The parents and neighbors might be avoiding conflict, but that doesn't make the author wrong for seeking what's fair. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
