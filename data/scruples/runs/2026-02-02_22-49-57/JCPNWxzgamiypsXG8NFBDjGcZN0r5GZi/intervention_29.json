Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. Let me break down the scenario first. The author's car was damaged by a neighbor's 16-year-old kid while they were away in Germany. The kid and his mom went to the author's parents, who told them not to worry about it. The author returns to find the damage and wants reimbursement, but everyone says he's the asshole for asking.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In many places, if someone damages another person's property, they're responsible for the damages. Even if the owner wasn't present, the person who caused the damage should cover the cost. The kid is a minor, so his parents might be liable. But the parents were told not to worry, so maybe the author's parents forgave the debt. However, the author wasn't consulted, so maybe they have a right to question it since they're the car's owner.\n\nEmotionally, the author is upset because they had to pay for repairs and didn't know about the incident. It's reasonable to expect that the person who caused the damage should cover the cost, especially if the parents were okay with it when they came to their house. The author's parents might have thought they were being generous, but it's possible they didn't consider the owner's right to seek compensation.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the kid hit the car, and even if the parents were told not to worry, the author has a right to be informed and to decide whether to forgive the payment. The fact that no one told the author is a problem. The neighbors might have an obligation to inform the actual owner, not just the parents. The author isn't overreacting by seeking reimbursement; it's their property and their financial loss.\n\nLooking at the responses from others, they might be focusing on the apology and the parents' forgiveness, but that doesn't negate the author's right to compensation. The author's parents might have made a decision without consulting the actual owner, which could be unfair. So, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to get their money back. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
