Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's kid hit their parked car while they were away. The parents of the kid said it's okay and didn't inform the owner. Now the author is upset because they have to pay for repairs and everyone says they're the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n\nHmm. The key points here are: the kid caused damage, the parents were informed, they offered to pay initially but the car owner's parents told them not to worry. The author returns and finds out about the damage and wants reimbursement. The parents are telling them not to make a big deal out of it. The author is angry about not being informed and not getting compensation.\n\nFirst, legally, the kid is a minor, so the parents are responsible. If the parents offered to pay but were told not to, that might be a problem. But the owner didn't have a chance to decide. The parents didn't inform the owner, which is a key issue. In many places, when someone's property is damaged, they have the right to seek compensation. The parents might have overstepped by not letting the owner know.\n\nEthically, the author is in a tough spot. They weren't told, so they lost the opportunity to handle the situation. The neighbors might have thought they were doing the right thing by resolving it quickly without involving police or insurance, but they still caused damage. The author is justified in wanting to be compensated. The neighbors might have a responsibility to cover the costs even if the parents didn't want to involve the kid. \n\nAlso, the fact that the kid apologized but didn't actually pay anything might be a problem. If the kid offered to pay but was denied by the author's parents, then maybe the author's parents had the authority to waive the payment? Wait, but the car is the author's, so their parents shouldn't have the right to waive reimbursement without consulting them. That seems like a big oversight. \n\nSo in terms of wrongdoings, the neighbor's kid and parents are responsible for the damage. The author's parents might have failed in informing the owner. The author is not in the wrong for seeking reimbursement since they were the victim. The neighbors, especially the parents, might be at fault for not following up properly. The author isn't the asshole here. They're standing up for their rights after being kept in the dark. \n\nSo the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The author has a legitimate claim and is not the asshole for wanting compensation. The neighbors and their parents made a mistake by not informing and not providing reimbursement.\n"
