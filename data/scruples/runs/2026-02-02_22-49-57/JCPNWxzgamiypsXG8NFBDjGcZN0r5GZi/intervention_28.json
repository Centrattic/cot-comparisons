Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the neighbor's kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The kid and his parents went to the author's parents' house, apologized, and offered to pay, but the parents said it's okay. Now the author is upset because they found out about the damage when they returned and want compensation, but everyone else says they're the asshole for asking.\n\nFirst, the kid is 16, so a minor. Legally, minors can be responsible for damages, but their parents might be liable as well. The kid did hit the car, which is intentional or at least careless. The parents were involved, though. They went to the parents' house, and the author's parents told them not to worry. But the author wasn't there, so they didn't get the chance to handle it themselves. \n\nThe author is upset because they had to pay for the repairs and are being told to just accept it. The parents and others think they're overreacting. Legally, the author might have a right to seek compensation since the kid was at fault. The parents' decision to let it go without consulting the car owner could be a problem because the author is the one who has to pay for the repairs. \n\nBut maybe the parents thought it's a small amount and didn't want to involve the police or insurance. However, the author is the rightful owner, so they should have the right to decide. The kid apologized and offered to pay, but the parents dismissed it. The author is now facing financial loss because no one informed them. \n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong for seeking reimbursement. Since they were away and their parents handled it without their input, maybe there's a conflict between the parents' decision and the author's right to compensation. Legally, the author might have a case, but socially, people might think it's a minor incident. \n\nBut the author isn't in the wrong because the damage was done to their property, and they're being unfairly expected to accept no compensation. The parents shouldn't have made the decision on their behalf. The answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
