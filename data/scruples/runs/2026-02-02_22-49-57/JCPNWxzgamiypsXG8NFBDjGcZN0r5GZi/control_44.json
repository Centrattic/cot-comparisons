Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that their neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The kid and his mom went to the parents' house, apologized, and offered to pay, but the parents said not to worry about it. Now the author is upset because they didn't get reimbursed and are being told they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if someone damages your property, they're usually responsible for the damages. But since the parents already said they'd handle it, maybe the author's parents took care of it by forgiving the debt. However, the car is the author's, so they should have been informed and involved in the resolution.\n\nEthically, the parents might have thought they were resolving the issue, but the owner should be informed about damage to their car, especially when it's expensive. The kid did apologize and offer to pay, but the parents accepted their offer and dismissed the issue. The author is now facing unexpected costs. \n\nThe key points are: the author wasn't informed, the damage is their financial burden, and the responsible party's family resolved it without the owner's consent. The author isn't overreacting because they're being asked to absorb the cost without prior notice. The parents might have made a mistake by not informing the author, and the kid should still be held accountable as the one who caused the damage. \n\nSo the author isn't in the wrong for seeking reimbursement. They have the right to know about the damage and to seek compensation. The neighbors and parents might have thought they were handling it, but the owner's rights were overlooked. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
