Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is the asshole for wanting reimbursement after their neighbor's kid damaged their car.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author left their car at their parents' house while in Germany. A 16-year-old neighbor backed into it. The kid and his mom went to the parents, apologized, and offered to pay. The parents said not to worry. Now the author is upset because they found out about the damage upon returning and want compensation. People are saying the author is overreacting.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's consider legal and social aspects. Legally, if a minor causes damage, their parents are usually liable. The parents might be responsible for covering the costs. The fact that the kid offered to pay but the parents dismissed it could mean they're avoiding responsibility. The author isn't at fault for the accident; they weren't even there. They have a right to know about the damage and seek compensation. The parents and neighbor might be in the wrong for not informing them and not taking responsibility. The author's reaction is understandable because they have to pay for repairs they didn't cause. So, the answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
