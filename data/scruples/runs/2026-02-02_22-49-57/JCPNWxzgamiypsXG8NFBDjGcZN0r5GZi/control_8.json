Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that their neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The kid and his parents were informed and even apologized, but the parents refused to take any action. The author came back to find the damage and is upset about the lack of compensation. Others are telling him he's overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the legal responsibility here. In many places, when someone damages another person's property, they are legally obligated to cover the costs unless there's an agreement to the contrary. The kid, being a minor, would likely have his parents liable. However, the parents might have resolved it with the author's parents. The story says that the kid's parents were upset about filing a claim, and the author's parents dismissed it, so maybe there was an informal agreement not to pursue compensation. \n\nBut the key issue is that the car owner (the author) wasn't informed. The author's parents might have agreed to let it go, but that decision wasn't made with the author's input. The car is the author's property, so their parents don't have the right to forgive the debt on their behalf unless they were acting as legal representatives. However, in many jurisdictions, parents can act on behalf of their minor child in such matters, but they can't unilaterally waive the rights of the car owner.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is now seeking reimbursement after the fact, which might be complicated because the initial parties (the parents) didn't pursue it. The neighbor's parents might argue that the matter was settled. However, the author's parents might not have the authority to make that decision for the author. So there's a conflict between the informal resolution by the parents and the author's right to seek compensation.\n\nLegally, the author might still be within their rights to seek compensation from the kid's parents. Ethically, the neighbor's family might be at fault for not informing the author. However, the author's parents' actions could be seen as complicating the matter. But the author's frustration is understandable because they were the actual victim and had no say in the initial decision.\n\nIn terms of social judgment, the author is being told to \"forget it,\" but that doesn't make it right. The author is justified in wanting to be compensated for their property. The problem is whether the author can still pursue this now, but that's more of a procedural question rather than whether they're in the wrong. The author isn't wrong for wanting compensation; the wrongdoers are the ones who caused the damage. The parents' handling of the situation might be the issue here, but the author isn't necessarily the one at fault for seeking what's owed to them.\n"
