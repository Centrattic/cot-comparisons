Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The kid and his parents went to the author's parents' house and offered to pay, but the parents dismissed it. Now the author is upset because they find out about the $1,000 damage and are being told to just let it go.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, if someone causes damage to your property, they are liable to pay for it. Even if the parents were there, the author is the car's owner, so they have the right to seek compensation. The fact that the kid was 16 might complicate things, but the parents' responsibility could still apply since they might be legally liable for their child's actions.\n\nNext, the social aspect. The author's parents initially accepted the apology and told them not to worry. But the author wasn't consulted, and they were in Germany. It's understandable that the author would feel wronged because they didn't have a say in the matter. The neighbors should have informed the car owner, regardless of the parents' dismissal.\n\nAlso, the author is being blamed by others for seeking reimbursement. That's odd because usually, people would support seeking compensation for someone else's damage. The neighbors not informing the author is another issue. If they had told them at the time, the author could have made a decision, but now they're facing the cost alone.\n\nConsidering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a legitimate right to seek compensation for damages caused by someone else. The initial handling by the parents doesn't absolve the responsible party from liability. So the answer should be B.\n"
