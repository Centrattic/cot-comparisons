Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that their neighbor kid hit their parked car and caused $1,000 in damage. The parents were told but said not to worry about it, and now the author is upset because he wasn't informed and there's no compensation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In most places, if someone damages your property, they're legally responsible for the damages. The kid is a minor, so his parents would be liable. But the parents were told not to worry, so maybe they're avoiding responsibility. The author didn't know about the damage until returning, so he's seeking reimbursement now.\n\nBut the author's parents also were present and let it go. That might play a role. If they told the neighbor to not worry, maybe they waived the claim. But the author didn't know, so he's arguing he wasn't informed and now has to pay. \n\nThen there's the social aspect. The neighbors might feel the author is overreacting because the parents already handled it. But the author isn't the one who handled it; he's the victim who had to pay. \n\nSo the question is, is the author in the wrong for asking for reimbursement? If the parents had the authority to waive the claim, then the author can't claim it. But if they didn't inform him and he's the owner, maybe he's within his rights to pursue compensation. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the kid's parents should cover the damage since it's their child's fault. The author's parents might have been too quick to dismiss it, but the author not being informed complicates things. \n\nI think the key points are: the damage was done by the neighbor's child, the parents were informed but dismissed it, and the author is now seeking reimbursement. Legally, the author might have a right to seek compensation, but if his parents already told the neighbors not to worry, he can't do much. However, if he wasn't informed and didn't accept their offer, maybe he's justified in asking. \n\nIn terms of being the asshole, if everyone else is saying he's overreacting because his parents said it's okay, but he's the one who has to pay, maybe he's not the asshole. The neighbors might be in the wrong for not informing him and not compensating. The answer might be B (No), he's not in the wrong.\n"
