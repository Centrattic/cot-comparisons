Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that a 16-year-old neighbor hit the author's parked car while the author was abroad. The parents of the kid were involved and apparently told the author's parents not to worry about it, so the author wasn't informed. Now the author is upset about the $1000 damage and wants reimbursement, but everyone says he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The kid caused damage, which is their fault. However, the author's parents and the kid's parents resolved it without the author's knowledge. The author wasn't informed until returning home. The main issue here is whether the author is overstepping by seeking reimbursement, given that his parents already handled it.\n\nLegally, when someone damages your property, they're responsible for compensation. But here, the parents might have already resolved it, so the author might not have a legal claim. But ethically, the author is the victim here. He wasn't involved in the initial resolution, and he's out of pocket for repairs. The parents might have agreed to let it go, but the author isn't bound by that if he wasn't part of the agreement.\n\nThe neighbors didn't inform the author about the damage, which is a problem. They might have thought the parents could handle it, but the parents should have informed the author, especially since it's his property. The kid apologized and offered to pay, but the parents said not to worry. But the author is now facing the financial loss.\n\nSo, from a legal standpoint, the kid's family should cover the damage. The parents might have acted without the author's consent, but if they have the authority to make such decisions (as guardians), maybe they can waive the claim. However, ethically, the author has a right to be informed and to seek compensation for his loss. The fact that others are calling him an asshole for seeking reimbursement suggests there's a cultural or social norm where people might downplay such incidents, but legally and ethically, the author isn't wrong for wanting to recover his costs.\n\nSo the answer is B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
