Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the Reddit AMA is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's kid hit their car while they were away. The parents were there and the kid's parents were involved. The kid apologized and offered to pay, but the parents said not to worry about it. Now the author is upset because they didn't get reimbursed and others think they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the legal and social aspects. Legally, if someone damages another person's property, they're usually responsible for the damages. The kid is a minor, so the parents are responsible. But the parents here were told not to worry about it. Did the parents have the authority to waive the claim? Since the car belongs to the author, the parents might not have the right to forgive the debt on their behalf. \n\nSocially, people might think that since the parents said it's okay, the author is being unreasonable to ask now. But the author didn't know about the damage and was away. The parents might have made a decision without consulting them. \n\nSo, the key points are: the author's parents might have overstepped by not informing the author and settling the issue. The kid's parents might be liable, but the initial damage was settled locally. The author's request for reimbursement is valid because they're the car owner, but the parents might have already addressed it. However, since the author wasn't informed, maybe the parents shouldn't have made that decision. \n\nIn terms of being the asshole, if the author is now seeking reimbursement after the parents said it's okay, others might see it as going back on the agreement. But if the parents didn't have the right to forgive the debt, the author isn't wrong. \n\nI think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the author is the owner of the car and the parents shouldn't have dismissed the claim without their consent. The kid's parents are responsible for their child's actions, so the author is justified in seeking reimbursement.\n"
