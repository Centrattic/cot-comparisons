Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The kid and his mother went to the author's parents, who said not to worry about it. Now the author is upset because they had to pay for repairs and everyone is telling them to just let it go.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect here. In many places, if someone damages another person's property, they are legally responsible for the damages. Even if the parents were there, the author's parents might not have the legal authority to waive that responsibility on behalf of the owner. The author is the rightful owner, so they should be the one to decide whether to accept an apology or seek compensation.\n\nThen there's the moral side. The author is being told to just let it go because the kid apologized, but they're out $1000. The parents might have thought it's a minor issue, but the author has legitimate financial loss. It's understandable for the author to want reimbursement. The kid's parents might have tried to downplay it, but that doesn't absolve them of responsibility.\n\nAlso, the author wasn't informed about the incident, which is a problem. The parents might have thought they were being kind by not telling, but that left the author to deal with the surprise damage upon returning. The author has every right to be upset about not being informed and not being compensated.\n\nI should check if there are any nuances I'm missing. For example, maybe the kid was a minor, so the parents are responsible. But regardless, the damage was done, and the responsible parties should cover the costs. The author isn't being unreasonable here. The fact that they're being called an asshole for seeking what's rightfully theirs suggests that others are not considering the financial impact and the author's right to compensation.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
