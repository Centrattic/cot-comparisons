Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were in Germany. The parents were there and spoke to the kid and his mom, but didn't tell the owner when he came back. Now the owner is upset about not getting reimbursed and people are saying he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out the legal and moral aspects. Legally, if someone damages your property, they're usually responsible for covering the costs. The kid is a minor, so his parents would be liable. However, the parents were involved and might have agreed to handle it, but they didn't inform the car owner. The parents might have let it slide, but the owner wasn't part of that decision. \n\nMoral angle: The owner didn't know about the damage until returning. It's reasonable for him to expect reimbursement since the damage wasn't his fault. The neighbors knew but didn't inform him, which is a problem. The kid apologized and offered to pay, but the parents dismissed it. The owner is now facing the financial burden, which he didn't cause.\n\nThe key points are: The damage was done, the responsible party (kid) and his parents were aware but didn't communicate with the car owner. The owner is asking for what's owed, which is fair. The people telling him to drop it might be prioritizing neighborly relations over justice. \n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the parents thought it was a minor incident or didn't want to involve the kid's insurance. But the owner's right to compensation stands. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. They're seeking what's rightfully theirs. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
