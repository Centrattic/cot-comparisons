Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation.\n\nThe neighbor kid, 16 years old, hit the author's parked car while the author was abroad. The damage is $1,000. The kid and his mom went to the author's parents' house. The parents said not to worry about it, and the kid apologized but offered to pay. The parents apparently told them not to worry. Now the author comes back and finds out about the damage, and he's upset because he wasn't informed and there's no compensation. The parents and others think he's overreacting and an asshole.\n\nFirst, the kid caused damage intentionally or not? Well, it's a parking situation, so maybe it was an accident. The kid is a minor, so he's 16. In many places, parents are responsible for their children's actions, especially if they were negligent. The kid offered to pay, but the parents didn't let it happen? Wait, the parents were upset if the author's side called the police or filed a claim. So maybe the parents are trying to avoid insurance issues or legal stuff.\n\nBut the author isn't the one who said to forget it. He's the victim here. His parents acted on his behalf, but he wasn't even there. So when he returns and finds out, he's justified in wanting reimbursement. The problem is that the parents already dismissed the issue. But the kid was responsible enough to offer to pay, but the parents might not have followed through. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for asking for reimbursement now. The kid's parents might be responsible for their child's actions. The author's parents told them not to worry, but they weren't the ones who had the damage. The author is the one who owns the car, so he's the one who should get compensation. \n\nIs there any reason the author is wrong? Maybe if the parents had the authority to forgive the debt on his behalf? But the author wasn't there, and he had no knowledge. So maybe the author's parents shouldn't have decided that for him. The kid's parents might have been negligent in not ensuring the owner was informed. \n\nSo the author is not in the wrong. He's the one who suffered the damage and wasn't informed. The kid is responsible for the damage, and the parents tried to sweep it under the rug. The author is justified in wanting compensation. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
