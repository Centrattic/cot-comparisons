Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's kid hit their parked car while they were abroad, causing $1,000 in damage. The kid and his parents were told by the author's parents not to worry about it, so no reimbursement was offered. Now the author is upset because they weren't informed and aren't getting compensation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal responsibilities. Normally, when someone damages another's property, they're responsible for covering the costs. The kid is 16, so his parents might be liable as they're his guardians. However, the author's parents forgave the debt, which complicates things. But the author is the car's owner, so they have a right to seek compensation. Did they lose that right by their parents not informing them?\n\nNext, communication. The parents didn't tell the author about the incident. That's a key point. The parents might have thought they were handling it, but the owner's right to know about damage to their property is important. The neighbors also didn't inform the author directly, which could be seen as evading responsibility.\n\nEthically, even if the parents forgave the debt, the author has a right to make their own decision. The parents might have the authority to waive the claim, but the author is the one bearing the financial burden. The neighbors might still be responsible for the damage, and the author's parents shouldn't have unilaterally decided without consulting the owner.\n\nThe author isn't overreacting if they're facing unexpected costs. The neighbors not informing them and the parents dismissing it could be seen as not taking responsibility. So, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong). They have the right to seek compensation and were not informed, which is a valid reason to be upset.\n"
