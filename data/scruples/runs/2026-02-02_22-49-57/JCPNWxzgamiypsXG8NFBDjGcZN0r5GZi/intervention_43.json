Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The scenario involves a neighbor's kid hitting their parked car while they were abroad, causing $1000 in damage. The kid and his parents went to the author's parents to resolve it, but the parents let it go. Now the author is upset because they weren't informed and there's no compensation. The question is whether the author is wrong for seeking reimbursement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. Generally, when someone's property is damaged, the person responsible is liable for the damages. The kid is 16, so he's a minor, but his parents are likely responsible since they went to the parents' house. The fact that the kid apologized and offered to pay but the parents dismissed it complicates things. The author's parents might have forgiven the debt, but does that absolve the kid of responsibility?\n\nEthically, the author is the car owner. They were away and not involved in the initial resolution. Their parents decided not to pursue compensation, but the author is now facing the financial loss. Is it fair for them to seek reimbursement? Legally, if the parents accepted the apology and let it go, maybe the author can't do anything. But ethically, they might feel wronged because they're the ones who have to pay for the damage. \n\nThe neighbors might argue that the matter was settled when the parents forgave them. However, the author wasn't part of that decision. The parents might not have the authority to waive the author's claim, especially if the car is registered under the author's name. Legally, the car owner is the one with the right to seek compensation. If the parents agreed to let it go without the author's consent, that might not be valid. \n\nIn some places, the parents might be responsible for their child's actions. If the kid admitted fault and the parents were present, they could be liable. The author's parents might have been mistaken in dismissing the issue, especially if they weren't the legal owners of the car. The author could still pursue the matter legally if their parents didn't have the legal right to waive their claim. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're seeking compensation for damage someone else caused. The neighbors might have made a good faith offer, but if they didn't follow through properly, the author has a right to be reimbursed. The fact that everyone is telling the author to let it go might be more about avoiding conflict than legal correctness. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
