Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit the author's parked car while the author was abroad. The kid and his mom went to the author's parents' house, the kid apologized, and offered to pay, but the parents said not to worry about it. Now the author is upset because he wasn't informed and there's no compensation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, when someone damages another person's property, they're legally responsible for the damages. Even if the parents told the kid not to worry about it, the owner of the car (the author) has the right to seek compensation. The parents might have forgiven the debt, but the author might still have a right to claim the expenses since they're the one who owns the car. So from a legal standpoint, the author is justified in seeking reimbursement.\n\nNext, the social angle. The author's parents and others think he's overreacting. But the author isn't the one who caused the damage. The kid's family might have resolved the issue with the parents, but the author wasn't involved. It's reasonable for the author to expect to be informed about such a significant event affecting his property. Also, the parents might have made a decision without consulting the actual owner, which could be a problem.\n\nThe kid is a minor, which complicates things. If the parents were involved, they might be responsible for their child's actions. But if they agreed to pay but the author's parents dismissed it, there's a conflict in who has the authority to waive the claim. The author's parents might have the right to forgive the debt, but the author is the one who's out of pocket. So the author's parents might have overstepped by not informing him.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for seeking compensation. The responsibility lies with the person who caused the damage, and the author has the right to reclaim the costs. The fact that others are calling him an asshole might be because they don't understand the situation fully or are downplaying the financial impact. The author's right to be informed and to seek reimbursement is valid here. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
