Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is the asshole in their situation. The scenario is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were away in Germany for three months. The kid and his mom went to the parent's house, apologized, and the parents said it's okay. Now the author is upset because they had to pay $1k for repairs and didn't get any compensation. People are telling them they're overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If the kid caused the damage, the parents are likely responsible since the kid is a minor. In many places, parents are liable for their child's actions. However, the parents might have resolved it themselves, which could mean they agreed not to make a claim. But the author, as the car owner, might have the right to seek compensation regardless of what the parents agreed. However, if the parents already accepted an apology and didn't press charges, maybe the author can't go back and demand payment now. But maybe there's a statute of limitations or some other legal time frame where they can still claim. But this is probably in the US, and the specifics of car accident claims in the US vary by state.\n\nThen there's the social aspect. The parents might have resolved it without informing the author because they didn't want to cause a problem or maybe they thought the damage was minor. But the author was away and didn't know. The kid apologized to the parents, but the car owner wasn't there. The parents might have thought they handled it, but the author is now upset about the financial loss. The author is being told to \"just forget it\" but feels wronged. \n\nThe key points are: 1. The accident happened while the author was away. 2. The parents were there and dealt with it, but didn't inform the author. 3. The author is now left with the cost. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for seeking reimbursement? Well, the kid caused damage to the car, which is the author's property. Legally, the author has the right to seek compensation. But the parents might have already interacted with the neighbor and perhaps there was an agreement not to pursue compensation. However, if the parents didn't consult the author, that's a problem. The parents might have assumed they could handle it, but the author's lack of knowledge means they didn't have a say in the matter.\n\nAlso, the kid's family might be financially responsible. If the kid is a minor, the parents are responsible for any damages. So the author could try to go through the kid's insurance or file a claim. If the kid's parents have insurance, that's typically where the compensation would come from.\n\nBut the author's parents might have told the neighbor's parents not to worry about it, which could mean they let the issue drop. However, the author, as the car owner, is now dealing with the expense. This situation might be a matter of the parents overstepping by deciding not to pursue compensation without consulting their child. The author's responsibility is to handle their own property, so maybe the parents shouldn't have made that decision on their behalf.\n\nIn terms of morality, the kid did something wrong, the parents of the kid tried to smooth things over, but the author is left out of the loop and out of pocket. The author isn't the asshole here because they're just asking for fair compensation for damage someone else caused. The neighbor's family might be at fault for not informing the author and not covering the costs. The author's parents could be at fault for not letting them know and for not standing up for their child's property rights.\n\nSo, based on this, the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to seek reimbursement for damages caused to their property. The parents and the neighbor's family might be in the wrong for not handling it properly. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
