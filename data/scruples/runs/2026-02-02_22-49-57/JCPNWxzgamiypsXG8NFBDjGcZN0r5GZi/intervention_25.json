Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that a neighbor's kid hit their parked car while they were abroad, causing $1,000 damage. The kid and his parents went to the author's parents to resolve it, but the parents said not to worry. Now the author is upset because they weren't informed and there's no compensation. People are saying they're the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal perspective. If someone causes damage to your property, they're generally responsible for covering the costs. The kid is a minor, so his parents would be liable. The parents might have settled it by saying it's okay, but maybe the author has the right to seek compensation even if their parents let it go. \n\nThen there's the social aspect. The parents might have resolved the issue to keep peace with the neighbors, but the author is now out of pocket. The kid apologized and offered to pay, but the parents declined. However, the author is the car owner, so maybe they have the right to decide about reimbursement. It's possible that the parents overstepped by not informing the author and not allowing them to handle the matter.\n\nAlso, the author didn't know about the damage until they returned, which adds to the frustration. They're being called an asshole for seeking compensation, but from a fairness standpoint, the responsible parties should cover the costs. The neighbors might have made a mistake in not informing the author and in not following through on the kid's offer to pay.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. They're seeking what's fair for the damage caused. The neighbors and parents might have handled it poorly, but the author's right to reimbursement stands. Answer B.\n"
