Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the situation described. The key points from the story are: a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit the author's parked car while they were abroad. The kid and his mom went to the author's parents and apologized, offered to pay, but the parents told them not to worry about it. Now the author is upset because they weren't informed and aren't getting compensation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, if someone else damages your property, they're responsible for the damages. Even if the parents forgave the debt, the legal responsibility might still lie with the kid or his family. But since the kid is a minor, the parents would typically be liable. However, the parents here chose not to compensate, which complicates things.\n\nNext, the social aspect. The author's parents didn't inform them, which is a problem. The author wasn't present, so their parents acted on their behalf. If the parents had the authority to forgive the debt, maybe the author can't later demand compensation. But if they didn't inform the author, did they have the right to make that decision? That's a gray area. \n\nThe author is upset because they're out $1,000. The neighbors were told to not worry about it, but the author feels wronged. The neighbors might feel they were already handled, but the author's parents might have overstepped by making that decision without consulting the author.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the kid is at fault for causing the damage. The parents might be at fault for not ensuring the author was informed. The author is trying to get reimbursement, which is their right unless it was explicitly forgiven. If the parents forgave it, maybe the author shouldn't demand it now. But if the parents didn't have the authority to forgive, then the author is justified.\n\nLooking at similar cases, if a parent acts on behalf of the car owner, they can sometimes settle the matter. But if the owner wasn't consulted, that might not be valid. However, in some jurisdictions, the car owner might be considered the \"real party in interest,\" so the parents acting on their behalf could be acceptable if they were the immediate caretakers.\n\nThe author's anger is understandable. They weren't informed, so they can't process the situation. The neighbors might not have a malicious intent, but they should have informed the author. The author isn't in the wrong for seeking compensation unless it was legally forgiven. Since the parents said \"don't worry about it,\" there's a conflict between their actions and the author's rights.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The main issue is the lack of communication and whether the parents had the authority to forgive the debt. The author has a right to be informed and to seek compensation if it wasn't properly resolved. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
