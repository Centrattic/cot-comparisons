Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The parents were present when the kid apologized and offered to pay, but the parents were told not to worry about it. Now the author is upset because they had to pay $1,000 for repairs and feels they should be reimbursed. Others are saying the author is being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is at fault. The key points are: the kid hit the car, the parents were informed, the kid and his parents tried to resolve it, the author's parents said not to worry, and the author wasn't informed. The author is now seeking reimbursement after returning.\n\nLegally, the kid is a minor, so the parents might be liable. But the parents in the situation already tried to handle it by the kid apologizing and offering to pay, but the author's parents dismissed it. The author wasn't present, so maybe there's an issue with how the original problem was handled. However, the author is now seeking reimbursement, which the others are against. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author is justified in wanting compensation for their property damage. The fact that the damage was done without their knowledge and they have to pay for it could make them feel wronged. The neighbors might argue that they resolved it with the kid's apology and the author's parents agreed to let it go. But the author's parents might not have the authority to waive the author's right to compensation, especially if the car is the author's property. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They are seeking what they're owed. The neighbors might have a responsibility to cover the damages even if the author's parents initially dismissed it. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
