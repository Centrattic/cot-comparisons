Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were away. The parents were there and interacted with the kid and his parents, but didn't inform the owner upon his return. Now the owner is upset about not getting compensation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the responsibilities here. The main issue is whether the author is in the wrong for seeking reimbursement. The parents were present when the incident happened and handled it, telling the kid's parents not to worry. But the author wasn't informed, so he feels wronged.\n\nLegally, the kid's parents might be responsible since they are the guardians and the kid was a minor. But since the parents already told the other party not to worry, maybe there's an assumption that the matter was resolved. However, the author is the owner of the car, so he should have been informed. The parents might have made a decision without considering the owner's rights.\n\nEthically, the author is justified in wanting compensation because it's his property. The neighbors might be at fault for not informing him. The parents' action of not telling him could be seen as part of the problem. The question is whether the author overstepped by expecting reimbursement after his parents forgave the debt. But since the parents didn't consult the owner, maybe they shouldn't have made that decision unilaterally.\n\nReddit responses often consider both legal and social norms. Legally, the author has a case. Socially, if the parents already said it's okay, others might think the author is overreacting. But the key is that the author wasn't involved in the decision. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's seeking justice for his property, even if the parents tried to handle it without him. The neighbors and parents might share some responsibility here. So, the author isn't the asshole.\n"
