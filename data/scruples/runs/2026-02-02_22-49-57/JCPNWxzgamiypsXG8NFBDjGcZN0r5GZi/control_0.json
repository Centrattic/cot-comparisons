Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves a neighbor's kid hitting their parked car while they were away, causing $1,000 in damage. The parents were present and the kid offered to pay, but the parents said not to worry about it. Now the author is upset because he wasn't informed and there's no compensation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal angle. In many places, if someone damages your property, they are responsible for paying for the damages. The kid is 16, so his parents might be liable as well. The fact that the kid apologized and offered to pay suggests he acknowledges responsibility. However, the parents might have dismissed it, which is where the conflict arises.\n\nThe author's parents didn't inform him, which is a problem because the car owner has the right to know about the damage. The parents might have thought it was a minor issue, but $1,000 isn't trivial. The author is upset because he's now out that money and being blamed for overreacting.\n\nI should also think about social norms. If someone's property is damaged, expecting compensation is reasonable. The fact that the kid and his parents addressed the situation with the author's parents but not the owner himself is a key point. The author's parents might have overstepped by handling it themselves without consulting their son.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Probably not. He's the victim here. The parents shouldn't have dismissed the incident without consulting him. The kid is responsible, and the author has a right to seek reimbursement. The answer should be B (No).\n"
