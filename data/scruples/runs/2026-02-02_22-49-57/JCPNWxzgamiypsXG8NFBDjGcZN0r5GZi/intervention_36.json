Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The key points here are that a neighbor's kid hit the author's parked car while the author was away, causing $1,000 in damage. The kid and his parents were informed, but the author's parents didn't tell them to contact the author. Now, the author is upset because he wasn't informed and isn't getting reimbursed.\n\nFirst, considering negligence. The kid was 16 and caused the damage. Typically, parents are responsible for their minor children's actions, especially if the kid isn't insured. The fact that the kid offered to pay but was told not to worry by the parents might matter here. However, the author's parents didn't inform the author about the incident, which is a point to consider.\n\nNext, legal responsibility. If the car was parked legally and the kid was at fault, the parents might be liable. But since the author's parents didn't notify the author, maybe there's a breakdown in communication. The author's main grievance is about not being informed and not being compensated. The community is saying the author is the asshole, but the author feels wronged because he has to pay for the damage.\n\nEthically, even if the parents tried to handle it, the author has the right to know about the damage. The kid's family's refusal to compensate could be seen as inconsiderate. The author isn't asking for more than reimbursement, which is reasonable. The parents might have good intentions by trying to avoid conflict, but they didn't consider the financial impact on the author.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. The kid's parents failed to inform the owner and didn't take responsibility, which is where the issue lies. The answer should be B.\n"
