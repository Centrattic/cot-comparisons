Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves a neighbor's kid damaging their car while they were abroad, and the parents didn't inform them or seek compensation. The author is upset about the $1,000 damage and feels wronged because they weren't told and there's no reimbursement. Others think the author is being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal liability. In most places, if someone causes damage to property, they are responsible for it. The kid is a minor, so his parents would typically be liable. The parents might be right to handle it themselves, but the author is the car owner, so they have a right to know about the damage. \n\nThe parents of the kid told the author's parents not to worry about it, but the author wasn't informed. Since the car belongs to the author, they should have been involved in any resolution. The parents might have resolved it by accepting the kid's offer to pay, but if they didn't pass on that agreement, the author is left out of the loop. \n\nThe author's parents might have thought they were being kind by not involving the author, but that's not their decision to make. The author has a right to know about the damage to their property and to seek compensation. So, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting reimbursement. Others might say the author is overreacting, but legally, the at-fault party (the kid's parents) should cover the damage. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
