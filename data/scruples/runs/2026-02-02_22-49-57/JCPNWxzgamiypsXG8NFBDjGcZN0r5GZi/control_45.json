Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is the asshole in the situation described. The scenario is that a neighbor's kid hit their car while they were abroad, causing $1000 in damage. The kid and his parents went to the author's parents but didn't inform the author. The parents told them not to worry about it, and now the author is upset about not being told and not getting compensation.\n\nFirst, I need to assess who is at fault here. The kid hit the car, which is clearly his responsibility. However, the parents were contacted and told not to worry, so maybe they thought it was resolved. The author's parents didn't inform their child, which is a problem. The author argues they should be reimbursed, but everyone else thinks they're overreacting.\n\nIn terms of legal responsibility, the kid's parents are usually liable for their minor's actions. However, if the author's parents accepted the apology and didn't press charges, that might complicate things. The author didn't know about the damage until returning, which is understandable. They have a right to know about damage to their property, especially when it's costly.\n\nEthically, even if the parents handled it, the author is the owner of the car. The parents might have intended to protect the neighbor's kid, but that doesn't absolve the responsibility to inform the owner. The author isn't the one who hit the car, so they aren't at fault. The issue is more about the parents not communicating and the neighbor's family not offering compensation despite the damage being their fault.\n\nReddit's \"Am I the Asshole\" community often looks at intent and fairness. The author is upset about unexpected costs and being ignored. The neighbor's family didn't inform them and dismissed the issue, which isn't fair. The parents didn't consult their child, so they might share some responsibility, but the main issue is the neighbor's family not providing compensation. The author's frustration is valid here. So, likely the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
