Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The kid and his mom went to the parents' house, apologized, and the parents said not to worry about it. Now the author is upset because he wasn't told and there's no compensation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, if someone damages your property, they're legally responsible for the damages. The kid is a minor, so the parents would typically be responsible. But the parents here told the kid not to worry about it. However, the author as the car owner might still have a right to seek compensation, even if the primary owner (the parents) tried to settle it without involving the actual owner (the author). \n\nThen there's the ethical side. The parents might have thought they were handling it, but the author wasn't informed. The author has a right to know about the damage to their property. Plus, the kid causing damage should be held accountable. The parents might have tried to resolve it informally, but if that didn't work out, the author is justified in seeking reimbursement.\n\nAlso, the author is being told he's overreacting. But when someone's property is damaged and they're out $1,000, it's reasonable to expect compensation. The neighbors might be dismissive because they don't face the financial burden, so their perspective might be biased.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The responsibility lies with the person who caused the damage, and the author's parents might have made a decision without consulting him. The answer should be B.\n"
