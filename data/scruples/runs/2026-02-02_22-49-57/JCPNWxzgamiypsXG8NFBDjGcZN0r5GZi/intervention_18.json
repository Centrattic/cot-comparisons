Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The neighbor kid hit their car while they were away, and the parents didn't inform them or get compensation. The author is upset about the $1,000 damage and being told they're the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. When someone damages another's property, they're generally responsible for covering the costs. The kid was 16, so his parents might be liable since he's a minor. Even though the kid apologized and offered to pay, the parents might have dismissed it, which could be their mistake. The author's parents told them not to worry, but that's not a legal solution. The author has a right to know about the damage and to seek compensation, especially since they have to pay for repairs.\n\nOn the other hand, the kid's family might have tried to resolve it by apologizing and offering payment, but the author's parents might have waved off the responsibility. However, the author wasn't consulted, so they might feel wronged. The key point is whether the author is in the wrong for asking for reimbursement. Legally, the responsible parties are the ones who caused the damage, not the author. So the author isn't in the wrong for seeking what's rightfully theirs. The problem here is that the parents didn't handle it properly, leading to the author's frustration. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
