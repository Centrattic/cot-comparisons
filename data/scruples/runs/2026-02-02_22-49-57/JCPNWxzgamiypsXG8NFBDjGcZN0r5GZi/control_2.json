Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor kid hit their parked car while they were away, and now they're asking for reimbursement. The parents and others think the author is being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The car was parked at the parents' house when the author was in Germany. The kid hit it and then told the parents. The parents said not to worry about it, so the kid apologized and offered to pay, but they were waved off. Now the author comes back to find the damage and wants compensation. The parents are telling him to forget it, and others think he's overreacting.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for asking for reimbursement. Let me think about legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if the kid is the one at fault, the owner should be compensated. The parents might have settled it on the author's behalf, but the author is the rightful owner. Did the parents have the authority to say not to worry about it? Since the author wasn't there, maybe they did, but the author would still be responsible for the repairs. But ethically, when someone's property is damaged intentionally or accidentally, they have the right to seek compensation. The kid and his parents offered to pay, but the author's parents accepted the apology and declined. Now the author is upset because he's out of pocket. \n\nIs the author overstepping by now demanding payment after his parents already handled it? Or is it reasonable because he's the car owner? The parents might have thought it was a small matter, but the cost is $1k. Maybe the parents should have informed the author and let him decide. By not doing so, they took away his choice. The kid's family might have thought the matter was settled, but the author is the one who actually owns the car. \n\nSo, the parents might be in the wrong for not informing him, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting compensation now. The kid is responsible, but maybe there's a time factor\u2014was the damage reported promptly? Since the incident happened while the author was away and the parents didn't inform him, maybe there's a delay in seeking reimbursement. But the damage isn't his fault. \n\nI think the key points are that the author's parents didn't inform him, and he's now being asked to accept no compensation. The kid's family might be responsible, and the author's parents shouldn't have decided for him. So the author isn't in the wrong for seeking what's his. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
