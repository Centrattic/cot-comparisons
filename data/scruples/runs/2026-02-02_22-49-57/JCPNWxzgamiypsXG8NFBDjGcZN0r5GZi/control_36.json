Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit the author's parked car while the author was abroad. The parents of the kid were there and spoke to the author's parents, who said not to worry about it. Now the author is upset because they weren't informed and there's no compensation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal perspective. In many places, if someone causes damage to another's property, they are legally responsible for covering the costs. The fact that the kid is a minor might mean his parents are liable. Since the parents were involved and initially offered to pay but were told it's okay, does that absolve them? Maybe not, especially if the damage wasn't their property. The author's parents might not have the authority to waive the claim on the author's behalf. \n\nThen there's the social aspect. The author's parents might have wanted to avoid conflict, but the author is now out $1000. It's reasonable for the author to seek reimbursement since the damage was caused by someone else. The neighbors might not have had the right to decide the matter without consulting the car owner. The kid apologized, but that doesn't replace financial responsibility.\n\nAlso, the parents of the kid might have acted in good faith, thinking a simple apology was enough. But financially, the author is the one who suffered loss. The neighbors should have informed the author once they returned. So, from the author's side, they're not being unreasonable. \n\nPutting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The responsibility lies with the person who caused the damage. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
