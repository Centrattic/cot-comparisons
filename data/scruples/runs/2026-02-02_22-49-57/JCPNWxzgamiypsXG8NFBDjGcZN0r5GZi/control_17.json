Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the given situation. Here's the scenario: a neighbor's kid, 16 years old, backed into the author's parked car while the author was abroad. The parents were informed, the kid apologized, and they were told not to worry about it. Now the author is upset because they weren't informed and want reimbursement. The parents and others think the author is being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The kid caused damage, but the parents were present when the incident happened. The parents were told not to file a claim, so they didn't. The author wasn't informed until returning home. The author is now seeking compensation, but others are telling them to drop it.\n\nLegally, if someone causes damage to your property, they are responsible for compensation. However, since the parents were present and the author's parents declined to take action, maybe there was an agreement to let it go. But the author is the car's owner, so they might have the right to pursue it. However, in some jurisdictions, if the owner (or someone acting on their behalf) forgives the debt, the person isn't legally obligated to pay. But since the author wasn't informed until after the fact, they might not have had a chance to make a decision.\n\nEthically, the kid caused damage and should cover the cost. The parents might have overstepped by not informing the car owner and dismissing the issue. The author is upset because they're out of pocket and not consulted. The parents might have been trying to be nice, but that doesn't absolve the kid's responsibility. \n\nHowever, the neighbor might not be at fault if they were told the matter was resolved. The author's parents might have the authority to forgive the debt since they were acting as the car's owner's representatives. But if the parents didn't have the authority (if the car was in the author's name), then their forgiveness might not be valid.\n\nIn some places, you can't just waive someone's liability for property damage without the owner's consent. So even if the author's parents tried to let it go, the author could still have a claim. The key is whether the parents had the right to forgive the debt on the author's behalf. If not, then the author isn't in the wrong for seeking reimbursement. \n\nAlso, the kid is a minor, so his parents are legally responsible for his actions. So even if the parents told the author's parents not to worry, they might still be liable. The author's parents might not have been the proper parties to forgive the damage, so the author's request for reimbursement is valid.\n\nSo considering all these points, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a right to seek compensation for damage done to their property, especially since they weren't involved in the initial resolution. The answer should be B.\n"
