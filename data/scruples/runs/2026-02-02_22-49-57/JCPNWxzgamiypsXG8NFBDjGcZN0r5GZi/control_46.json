Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were abroad. The kid and his mom went to their parents' house, apologized, and offered to pay, but the parents let it slide. Now the author is upset because he wasn't informed and there's no compensation. The question is whether he's the asshole for wanting reimbursement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, when someone damages your property, they're responsible for covering the costs. Even if the parents initially handled it, the car owner has the right to seek compensation. The kid is a minor, but his parents might still be liable. The author wasn't told, which is a problem because he's the actual owner. His parents might have overstepped by not informing him.\n\nThen there's the moral side. The kid admitted fault, apologized, and offered to pay, but the parents dismissed it. The author is now out $1,000. It's reasonable for him to want compensation since he's the one who has to pay for the repairs. Not being informed was a big oversight. The people around him think he's overreacting, but he's the one facing financial loss. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe there's a cultural context in Germany about handling such incidents. Sometimes, in some cultures, people might prefer to let small matters go to avoid conflict. But the amount here is significant, $1,000, which isn't trivial. The author is in a position where he has to pay out of pocket, so expecting reimbursement is understandable. \n\nThe key points are: the damage was done, the responsible party acknowledged it, and the owner wasn't informed. The parents might have resolved it without consulting the car owner, which is a mistake. The author isn't in the wrong for seeking what he's owed. The neighbors, especially the parents, might be at fault for not informing him and dismissing his right to compensation. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong. He's seeking reimbursement for damages caused by someone else. The fact that his parents didn't inform him and others are dismissing his concerns doesn't make him the asshole. He's the victim here.\n"
