Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's kid hit their parked car while they were away in Germany. The author's parents were there and initially told the kid's parents not to worry about it. But when the author comes back and sees the damage, they want reimbursement. Everyone is telling them they're the asshole for asking, but the author doesn't think so.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if someone hits your car, they're usually responsible for damages. The kid is 16, so the parents might be responsible since minors can't be held fully liable. The author's parents could have filed a claim through their insurance, but they didn't. Instead, they let the kid apologize and said not to worry about it. But the author didn't know about the incident until returning. So, the parents might have made a decision without the author's knowledge, which could be a problem.\n\nEthically, the author is upset because they had to pay $1,000. The kid hit the car, and even if the parents let it go, the author might feel wronged. However, the parents were present and handled the situation. But the author wasn't consulted, so maybe they have a right to be upset. The parents might have thought it was a minor issue, but the cost to the author is significant.\n\nAlso, the kid and his parents did approach the author's parents and offered to pay, but the parents accepted the apology. Now the author is coming back and wants compensation. The problem here is whether the parents had the authority to let it go. The author is the car owner, so maybe the parents shouldn't have made that decision without the author's input.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because the parents didn't inform them and made a decision that affected the author's property. The author has a right to seek reimbursement since the damage was caused by someone else. The kid's parents might be responsible to cover the cost, especially since their child was at fault. However, the initial response from the author's parents complicates things. But the author isn't the one who let it slide; they just found out later. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for seeking compensation now.\n"
