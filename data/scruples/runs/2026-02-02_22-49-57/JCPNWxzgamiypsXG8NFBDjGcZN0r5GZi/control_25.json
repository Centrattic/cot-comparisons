Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their car while they were abroad, causing $1,000 damage. The kid and his mom went to the parents' house, apologized, and offered to pay, but the parents let it go. Now the author is upset because they weren't informed and there's no compensation.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is at fault. The key points here are the responsibility of the neighbor's family, the role of the author's parents, and the author's right to seek reimbursement.\n\nThe kid is a minor, so the parents are responsible for their child's actions. When the incident happened, the kid and his mom approached the author's parents, the kid apologized and offered to pay, but the parents dismissed it. They didn't inform the author about the damage, even after he returned. The author argues that since the parents resolved it without his knowledge, he's now out $1,000. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the parents agreed to let the kid off without payment, maybe there's an issue. But ethically, the parents might have overstepped by not informing the car owner. The author isn't at fault for the accident itself, but he might be in the wrong if he's challenging a resolution that the parents already accepted. However, the parents might have the right to accept or reject compensation on behalf of their child. \n\nBut wait, the author is the car owner. His parents didn't own the car, so they didn't have the authority to waive his right to compensation. So maybe the parents were wrong for not informing him, and the author is justified in seeking reimbursement. The kid's family is responsible, and the author isn't the asshole here. The parents should have mentioned the incident when he returned. So the answer is B.\n"
