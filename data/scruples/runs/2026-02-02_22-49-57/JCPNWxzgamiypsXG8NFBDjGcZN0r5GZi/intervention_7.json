Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation involves a neighbor's kid hitting their parked car while they were abroad, causing $1,000 in damage. The kid and his parents went to the author's parents, apologized, and offered to pay, but the parents dismissed it. Now the author is upset because they weren't informed and aren't getting compensation. Others are telling them they're the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if someone damages another person's property, they are typically responsible for the damages. The kid is 16, so the parents might be liable as the guardian. The fact that the parents were approached and offered to pay but were told to forget it complicates things. The author's parents might have the authority to accept the apology and forgive the debt, but the author is the car owner, so they have a right to seek compensation. However, if the parents accepted the apology and refused to pursue reimbursement, that might release the other party from liability. But the author wasn't consulted, which is a problem because they're the owner.\n\nEthically, the author is upset about not being informed. The parents handled the situation without consulting them, which is a breach of communication. The author's frustration is valid because they ended up with the financial burden. The neighbors and parents might think it's resolved, but the author feels wronged because they have to pay. The key points are whether the parents had the right to forgive the debt without the owner's consent and if the kid and his family are still responsible.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, the car owner might need to pursue the matter through legal channels if the responsible party isn't compensating them. However, since the parents might have already accepted the apology and dismissed the claim, the author might have to consider that the issue was resolved. But if the parents didn't have the authority to do that, the author could still seek compensation. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for wanting reimbursement because it's their property. The neighbors and parents are in the wrong for not informing them and not addressing the financial responsibility properly. The author's reaction is reasonable given the situation. So the answer would be B, they are not in the wrong.\n"
