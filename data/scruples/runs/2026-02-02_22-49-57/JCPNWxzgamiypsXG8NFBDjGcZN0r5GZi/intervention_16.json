Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's kid hit their car while they were away, causing $1000 in damage. The parents found out and the kid offered to pay, but the parents told them not to worry about it. Now the author is upset because when they returned, they had to pay for the repairs and everyone says they're the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n\nHmm. The key points here are: the kid caused the damage, the parents were informed, the kid offered to pay but the parents waived it. Now the author is upset because they had to cover the cost. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong.\n\nI need to determine if the author is at fault. Let's break it down. First, the kid was at fault for hitting the car. The parents should inform the car owner. Since the author was away, maybe the parents had the authority to handle it. But they didn't tell the author and also didn't get compensation. Now the author is being blamed for wanting reimbursement.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, if someone causes damage to a car, they're liable for repairs. Even if the parents accepted the kid's apology and said it's okay, once the author returns, they have a right to seek compensation. The parents might have overstepped by not informing the author or handling the payment. The author isn't at fault for the accident, so they're justified in seeking reimbursement. But maybe there's a social expectation that if the parents already sorted it, the author shouldn't ask again. However, legally, the author isn't wrong to seek compensation. So the answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
