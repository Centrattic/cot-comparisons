Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's kid hit their parked car while they were away, causing $1,000 in damages. The kid and his parents went to the author's parents, apologized, and offered to pay, but the parents dismissed it. Now the author is upset because they weren't informed and there's no compensation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if a minor causes damage, their parents are usually responsible. The kid is 16, so he's a minor, so the parents should handle liability. The parents might have responsibility here, even if the kid offered to pay. Ethically, the parents might have a duty to inform the car owner, especially if they knew about the damage. The author's parents didn't tell them, which could be a problem because the car owner has a right to know about damages to their property.\n\nThe author is upset because they didn't get a chance to handle the situation themselves. They might feel that their parents overstepped by not informing them. The kid and his parents didn't contact the car owner directly, which could be a mistake. The kid apologized to the parents but not to the actual owner, which might be a procedural error. The neighbors could have informed the author directly if they knew he was away, but instead went to the parents. The author's parents dismissed it, not understanding the financial impact on the owner.\n\nNow, looking at the responses from Reddit, the user mentions that everyone is saying the author is the asshole. That's probably because the parents handled it, and others might think the author is being unreasonable. But the key points here are whether the author had a right to expect reimbursement and if the parents had the authority to dismiss the claim. Since the author is the car owner, they have the right to seek compensation. The parents might have acted without consulting the owner, which is where the conflict arises.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for asking for reimbursement. The responsibility lies with the kid's parents, and the author's parents might have made a mistake by not informing them. The neighbors didn't inform the rightful owner, which is a problem. The author is justified in seeking compensation because the damage was done to their property. The fact that the parents tried to brush it off doesn't absolve the responsible parties. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
