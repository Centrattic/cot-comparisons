Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation is that a neighbor's kid hit their parked car while they were away, causing $1k in damage. The parents were there and spoke to the kid and his mom, but the parents said not to worry about it. Now the author is upset because they didn't get compensation and others think they're overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author's actions are justified. The kid caused damage, and the author is seeking reimbursement. Legally, when someone causes damage to another's property, they are usually liable for the costs. The parents might have forgiven the debt, but the actual owner (the author) has the right to seek compensation. \n\nThe parents might have thought resolving it between them was sufficient, but the author is the one who paid for the repairs. By not informing the author, the parents might have made an agreement without consulting the rightful owner. The author isn't wrong for wanting to know about the damage and seeking reimbursement. Others saying they're the asshole might be because they think the parents' forgiveness should stand, but the author is the one who incurred the financial loss. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for seeking what's rightfully theirs. They weren't aware of the incident and their property was damaged without their knowledge. The kid and his parents should have informed the author and covered the costs. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
