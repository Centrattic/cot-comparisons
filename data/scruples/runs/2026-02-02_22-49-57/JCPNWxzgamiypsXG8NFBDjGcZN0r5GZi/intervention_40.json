Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe person left their car parked at their parents' house in the US while they were in Germany for three months. A 16-year-old neighbor kid hit the car while backing up. The kid and his mother went to the parents' house, the parents didn't tell the author, and the kid offered to pay but the parents said not to worry. Now the author is upset because they had to pay $1,000 in damages and everyone is telling them they're the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The kid hit the car, but the owner wasn't there. The parents were approached, and they didn't inform the actual car owner. The parents told the kid not to worry about it, even though the kid offered to pay. The author is returning and finding out about the damage, which is expensive.\n\nSo, the question is: Is the author in the wrong for expecting reimbursement?\n\nI think about legal responsibility here. In most places, if someone damages your property, they're legally responsible to pay for repairs. The kid is 16, a minor, so liability might fall on his parents. But the parents were there and told the kid not to worry about it. However, that doesn't negate the legal obligation. If the parents accepted the kid's offer and said it's okay, maybe they thought they could handle it, but the actual owner (the author) is the one who incurred the cost.\n\nThe author is upset because they were not informed. The parents who were present at the scene didn't inform them, which is a problem. But the author is now seeking reimbursement, which is their right. The neighbors (the kid and his parents) caused the damage, so they should be responsible. The parents of the kid might have a duty to cover it, even if they said to forget it. The author isn't overstepping by seeking compensation. The fact that the kid offered to pay but was told it's okay doesn't absolve them of liability. So, the author is justified in wanting reimbursement. The people telling them they're the asshole are probably not considering the financial burden and the right to compensation for damages. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they are within their rights to seek reimbursement for a damage caused by someone else. The parents not informing them and dismissing the issue doesn't make it right for the neighbors to avoid responsibility.\n"
