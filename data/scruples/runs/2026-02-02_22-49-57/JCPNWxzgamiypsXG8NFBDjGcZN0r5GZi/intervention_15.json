Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation. The author's car was damaged by a neighbor kid who's 16 years old while the author was in Germany for three months. The car was parked at the author's parents' house. When the accident happened, the kid and his mom went to the parents' house to sort things out. The parents said not to worry about it, and the kid apologized and offered to pay, but they were told it was okay. Now the author comes back to find out about the damage and is upset because he wasn't informed and there's no compensation. The author is being told by everyone, including his parents, that he's overreacting and should just accept it. He's asking if he's the asshole (ITA) for wanting reimbursement.\n\nFirst, let's look at the legal aspect. In most places, if someone causes damage to your property, they are responsible for covering the costs. The fact that the kid is 16 might mean that his parents are legally responsible since he's a minor. The kid offered to pay, but the author's parents dismissed it. Legally, the author should be able to seek compensation from the kid's parents, especially since the kid admitted fault. But since the parents already told the kid to forget about it, maybe the author's options are limited.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author's parents didn't inform him about the accident, which is a problem. They might have thought it was better to let it go, but that's not fair to the author who has to deal with the consequences. The author is upset because he didn't know and now has to pay for repairs. The neighbors might have done the right thing by not pressing charges, but that doesn't mean the author shouldn't be compensated. However, the author's parents might have resolved the issue by accepting the apology and not pressing for payment. \n\nThe author is in a tough spot because he wasn't informed and now has to pay for something not his fault. The neighbors might think they've done their part by apologizing, but the author is the one bearing the financial burden. The question is whether the author is wrong for expecting reimbursement. Legally, maybe he has a case, but since the parents already handled it, maybe not. Ethically, it's about responsibility. The kid caused the damage, so he should pay. But since the parents already said it's okay, maybe the author isn't in the wrong for wanting compensation but also not being informed. \n\nI think the key points are that the parents didn't inform the author, and the kid's family offered to pay but were told not to worry. The author is upset because he's now dealing with the financial hit. The answer depends on whether the author had a right to be informed and to seek compensation. If the parents were the legal owners, maybe they can't be reimbursed, but since it's the author's car, he should have the right to seek damages. But the parents might have authority to make that decision. If they said it's okay, then maybe the author can't go back and ask for money. However, if the parents didn't inform him, that's a separate issue. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the parents had authority to settle the matter, then the author's complaint is about not being informed, which is a problem for the parents, not necessarily the kid. But the author is upset because he didn't get reimbursed. If the parents already dismissed the issue, the author might not be able to go back. But ethically, the kid's family should pay. The author isn't in the wrong for expecting that. However, since the parents already resolved it, maybe the author is overstepping. \n\nHmm. I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the kid's family caused the damage and should compensate, regardless of the parents' initial dismissal. The author has a right to seek reimbursement even if his parents let it go. The parents might be at fault for not informing him and not handling it properly. The author isn't the one who caused the damage, so he's not in the wrong for wanting to get his money back.\n"
