Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for wanting reimbursement after their neighbor's kid damaged their car.\n\nFirst, the facts: The kid was 16, backed into the parked car while the owner was away. The kid and his parents went to the owner's parents, apologized, and offered to pay, but the parents said not to worry. The author came back to find the damage, was upset, and wants compensation. Others are telling him to drop it because the kid apologized and \"these things happen.\"\n\nNow, legal perspective. In most places, if someone causes damage to your property, they're liable. Minors can be held accountable through their parents. The fact that the kid's family offered to pay but the author's parents dismissed it might complicate things. If the damage occurred in the US, the author has the right to seek compensation even if the parents initially said not to pursue it. However, the author's parents might have waived that right by not informing him earlier. But legally, the author could still be within their rights to claim the damages now, especially if it's recent.\n\nMoral perspective: The kid is responsible; he caused the damage. The author isn't at fault for wanting to cover their financial loss. However, the parents of the kid might have a point if they handled it in good faith, but the author's parents accepting the apology might have given a false impression that the matter was resolved.\n\nSocial dynamics: The community's reaction is to tell the author to let it go, maybe because they see the kid as a minor and the initial resolution as sufficient. But the author is being unfair to expect others to pay for his loss. However, if the author's parents didn't inform him, that's a separate issue.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Legally, probably not. Morally, maybe not either. The neighbors might have a case if they resolved it with the parents, but the author's right to compensation still stands. The parents might be at fault for not communicating with the author. The answer hinges on whether the author's parents had the authority to waive the claim. If the car owner (author) wasn't present and the parents acted without his knowledge, the author isn't wrong in seeking reimbursement. Hence, answer B.\n"
