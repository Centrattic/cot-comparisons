Nobody told me and everyone says I'm the asshole for asking for reimbursement.\n \n\nI was staying with my girlfriend in Germany for three months so I left my car parked across the street at my parent's house. While I was working remotely and trying to make enough to get a visa, the neighbor kid who is 16 backed up into my front end and caused significant damage to my bumper, headlamp assembly, and hood.\n\nAfter the incident he and his mother walked next door to my parent's house to try to resolve the situation. His parents were all upset that we'd call the police or file a claim, but my parent's said don't worry about it. He apologized to them and offered to pay but my parents apparently told them not to worry about it.\n\nI returned home two days ago to find about $1,000 dollars worth of damage to my car, and I'm understandably upset because 1. Nobody told me about it and 2. There is no compensation for me at all.\n\nI'm being told my parents to forget it, the kid apologized and \"These things happen.\" Everyone thinks I'm the asshole and overreacting, but none of them have to pay $1,000 and deal with the aftermath.\n\nIn my opinion, the kid hit a car, didn't inform the owner, and at absolute minimum should reimburse me for the damages.\n\nReddit, what's your take? Am I the Asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is that their neighbor's 16-year-old kid hit their parked car while they were in Germany. The kid and his parents went to the author's parents and apologized, even offering to pay, but the parents dismissed it. Now the author is upset because they didn't get informed and there's no compensation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most places, when someone damages another person's property, they are responsible for the damages. Even if the parents told the neighbor not to worry, the legal responsibility might still lie with the kid and his family. The author is the rightful owner of the car, so they have the right to seek reimbursement regardless of what their parents said. The neighbor's liability here is clear; they caused the damage and should cover the costs.\n\nThen there's the issue of communication. The author wasn't informed about the incident until returning home. The parents' decision to not notify them or handle the matter might have been a mistake. The author has every right to be upset because they were left in the dark and now have unexpected expenses.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, expecting someone else to pay for damages they caused is reasonable. The neighbor's family might have tried to downplay the incident, but the author isn't at fault for seeking what they're owed. The fact that the kid offered to pay initially but was told not to worry by the parents complicates things, but the author's right to pursue compensation remains.\n\nThe community's reaction, calling the author an asshole for asking for reimbursement, seems misplaced. It's unfair to blame the victim for wanting to be compensated for damages caused by someone else. The author isn't the one who caused the accident, so they shouldn't be seen as the problem here.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong. They were a victim of an accident, weren't informed, and are seeking rightful compensation. The neighbor's family has the responsibility to cover the damages, and the author is justified in their request.\n"
