Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about their fianc\u00e9e's decreased sex drive after engagement, which they now realize is due to her wanting to wait until marriage for future sexual activity, influenced by her Catholic background and friends.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author mentions that before engagement, they had a good sex life, but after engagement, it dropped significantly. The fianc\u00e9e initially blamed body image issues but later revealed she wants to wait until after marriage. The author feels upset and resentful because they didn't agree to this when they started dating, and the change is affecting their relationship.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they made a commitment to marry and expected intimacy to continue. The fianc\u00e9e's sudden shift in behavior without prior discussion might make the author feel like their needs are being neglected. They're questioning if it's fair to adjust expectations post-engagement.\n\nOn the other side, the fianc\u00e9e has her reasons rooted in personal beliefs and religious upbringing. She might feel conflicted between her current desires and her past decisions. It's possible she didn't realize how much this would impact the relationship until it was already causing tension. Her Catholic background might make her feel guilty about premarital sex, leading her to want to change their dynamic.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. They didn't initiate this change; it was the fianc\u00e9e's choice. However, they did confront her and tried to understand her reasons. The author's resentment comes from the unmet expectations and lack of prior communication. But the fianc\u00e9e's decision is a personal one, possibly influenced by her values. \n\nThe key here is consent and mutual agreement. The author didn't agree to wait until marriage for all sexual activity when they started dating. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to change their relationship's sexual aspect post-engagement might be a breach of the initial understanding. However, people can change their minds based on new circumstances or personal growth. \n\nBut is the author wrong for feeling upset? They have a right to be concerned about their needs and the relationship's intimacy. However, the fianc\u00e9e's reasons are personal and valid. The problem arises if the author is pressuring her to continue, but the story suggests they're upset because she changed her mind. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties need to communicate. The fianc\u00e9e should have discussed her feelings earlier, and the author might need to adjust or find a middle ground. However, the author isn't wrong for being upset; they have a right to express their feelings. The focus should be on resolving the issue together rather than assigning blame. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is that the author isn't in the wrong. They're dealing with a situation where expectations changed after the engagement, which they didn't agree to initially. Their feelings of resentment are valid given the circumstances, but the primary issue is the lack of prior communication from the fianc\u00e9e. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
