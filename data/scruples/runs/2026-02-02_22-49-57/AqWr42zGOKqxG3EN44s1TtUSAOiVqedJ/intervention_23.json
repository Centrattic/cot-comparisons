Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is a fianc\u00e9 whose partner's sex drive dropped after engagement. They had good sex before engagement but now it's rare. The fianc\u00e9 confronted the partner, who revealed she's feeling guilty due to Catholic upbringing and wants to wait until marriage, even though they both didn't choose that path initially. The author is upset, feels a dynamic change, and resents her for it.\n\nFirst, the key points: The partner changed her stance post-engagement, which wasn't discussed before. The author didn't agree to waiting for the first time until marriage. The partner's reasons are internal\u2014body image, religion, past relationships. The author is upset because their expectations aren't met. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's feelings are valid; they had a prior sexual relationship and now it's drastically reduced. The partner's reasons are personal and moral, but the change came after commitment. The author isn't pressuring her to have sex, but is upset that the dynamic shifted. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The partner did express feelings of guilt and body issues, but the author feels this was a sudden shift. The author isn't forcing her to have sex, just expressing frustration. It's about unmet expectations. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for feeling this way? If they didn't agree to waiting, and the partner changed the terms without prior consent, then the author isn't in the wrong. However, if the author is pressuring the partner to have sex despite her reasons, that would be wrong. But the author seems to be upset about the change in dynamic, not actively forcing her. So the answer would be B\u2014Not in the wrong.\n"
