Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. Let's start by breaking down the details.\n\nThe author is engaged to their fianc\u00e9e, and they've been engaged for a year with a wedding coming up soon. Before the engagement, they had a good sex life, three times a week. After the engagement, it dropped to twice in a year. The fianc\u00e9e initially blamed body image issues like weight gain and psoriasis. The author respected that and didn't push. But then, after some time, they confronted her, and she admitted that she didn't lose her virginity the way she wanted in her previous relationship and now feels conflicted about having sex before marriage. She's Catholic and feels guilty as the wedding approaches. The author is upset, feels they didn't agree to wait until marriage, and now there's a change in their dynamic leading to resentment.\n\nSo the question is, is the author in the wrong here? The options are A (Yes) or B (No). Let's analyze both sides.\n\nFirst, the author's perspective: They entered the relationship expecting a certain level of sexual activity, which was established before the engagement. Now, after becoming engaged, the fianc\u00e9e has significantly reduced sexual activity, not just due to physical reasons but due to religious and personal beliefs that emerged after the engagement. The author feels they didn't consent to waiting until marriage, which is a significant change from their initial agreement. The author's resentment is understandable because the expectation was different, and this change is affecting their relationship.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's side: She's dealing with personal issues, religious guilt, and past experiences. She came from a Catholic background, and her change in behavior is based on her own moral conflict. She initially blamed physical issues but later revealed deeper reasons. She may be struggling with her own values and how to reconcile them with her current relationship.\n\nNow, considering the concept of consent and mutual agreement in relationships. When they started dating, neither of them agreed to wait until marriage. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to wait came after the engagement, which the author didn't anticipate. The author's frustration comes from unmet expectations. Relationships require communication, and while the fianc\u00e9e communicated her issues, the author felt they weren't being honest until later. The author's resentment is a reaction to this change in terms they didn't agree to.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a complex situation. The author isn't \"wrong\" for being upset because the expectations were different. However, they might be expected to handle the situation with more understanding. But the key point is whether the author's feelings and actions (feeling resentful) make them the asshole. If the fianc\u00e9e's reasons are genuine and she's communicated them, then the author's resentment might be justified if there was a lack of prior discussion about boundaries. However, if the author expected a certain level of sexual activity and it's now being withheld without prior agreement, that's a valid concern.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after the engagement, which wasn't part of the original understanding. The author's resentment is about this unexpected change. Since both parties should communicate openly about such significant issues, the fianc\u00e9e's delay in revealing her true reasons might contribute to the problem. However, the author's reaction could be seen as self-centered if they didn't consider her religious and emotional struggles. But given that they had an established sexual relationship before engagement and the change came abruptly, the author's frustration is reasonable.\n\nI think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong because the change in the fianc\u00e9e's behavior wasn't agreed upon initially. However, the situation is nuanced. The key is whether the author's feelings are valid. Since they didn't consent to waiting until marriage, their upset is justified. The fianc\u00e9e's reasons are personal, but the author's right to express frustration isn't making them the asshole. Therefore, the answer might be B (No).\n"
