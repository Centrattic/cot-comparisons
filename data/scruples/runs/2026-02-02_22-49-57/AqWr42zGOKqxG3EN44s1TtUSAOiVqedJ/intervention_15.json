Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the fianc\u00e9's sex drive dropped after they got engaged. The author is upset because they used to have sex three times a week before engagement, and now it's only twice in a year. The fianc\u00e9 initially blamed body issues like weight gain and psoriasis but later admitted it's because she wants to wait until after marriage to have sex again. She comes from a religious Catholic background and feels guilty, even though neither of them chose to wait when they started dating.\n\nThe author is asking if they're the asshole for being upset. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Both partners didn't choose to wait when they started dating, so expectations were set from the beginning. When they got engaged, the fianc\u00e9 changed her mind, which caused a conflict. The author is upset because their expectations changed after the engagement, leading to a significant decrease in intimacy. \n\nNow, in relationships, communication is key. The fianc\u00e9 did explain her reasons, but the issue is that her priorities shifted after the engagement. The author might feel betrayed or unprepared for this change, especially since they had a good sex life before. The author is not pushing for premarital sex but is upset about the sudden change in their dynamic. \n\nHowever, the fianc\u00e9's decision is influenced by her religious background and personal feelings of guilt. But she chose to be with the author and didn't wait before. Now, near the wedding, she's changing her stance. The author is within their rights to feel hurt or resentful because the expectation wasn't there initially. The fianc\u00e9's change in behavior affects the relationship's balance, and the author is voicing their concerns. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? The author isn't pressuring the fianc\u00e9 to have sex if she's not comfortable. They respected her initial reasons and waited. However, the fact that the fianc\u00e9 changed her mind after the engagement and didn't communicate this earlier might be the main issue. The author's resentment is a result of unmet expectations and a lack of prior communication about this aspect. \n\nIn this case, the fianc\u00e9's change in stance after the engagement could be seen as the main problem. The author isn't wrong for feeling upset because their expectations were not aligned with the new reality. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
