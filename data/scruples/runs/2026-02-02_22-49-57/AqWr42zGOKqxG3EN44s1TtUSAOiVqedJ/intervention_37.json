Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author is engaged and wants to have sex, but their fianc\u00e9e's sex drive has dropped significantly after engagement. The fianc\u00e9e initially blamed body issues but later admitted she wants to wait until marriage due to Catholic upbringing and guilt. The author feels upset and is developing resentment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple started dating before engagement and had a regular sex life. The fianc\u00e9e's change in desire came after engagement. The author didn't know about her intention to wait until marriage when they started dating. The fianc\u00e9e's reasons are based on her religious background and peer influences. \n\nThe author is upset because their expectations changed. They didn't agree to wait for marriage when they started the relationship. Now, close to the wedding, the fianc\u00e9e's stance has caused a shift in their dynamic. The author feels resentful because their needs aren't being met, and they feel this was a sudden shift. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they are expressing their feelings of disappointment and resentment. They tried to respect the fianc\u00e9e's initial reasons but now feel misled because the real issue was revealed later. The fianc\u00e9e's change in behavior happened after the engagement, which might be a key point. The author didn't agree to this change when they started the relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e has her reasons rooted in her upbringing. But the author might feel that the expectations weren't clear from the start. The problem arises because the fianc\u00e9e's decision to wait until marriage came after the engagement, which the author didn't agree to. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties need to communicate their needs and expectations. The fianc\u00e9e didn't communicate this desire to wait earlier, leading to the author's current feelings. However, the author is also expressing their feelings validly. They aren't wrong for being upset about unmet expectations. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling upset. The issue stems from a lack of communication and mismatched expectations. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
