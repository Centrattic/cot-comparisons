Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a fianc\u00e9 whose sex drive has dropped after they got engaged. The author is upset because the fianc\u00e9 now wants to wait until after marriage to have sex, citing Catholic upbringing and guilt about not losing her virginity in a certain way. The author feels they didn't agree to this arrangement before marriage and are now resentful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple was engaged for a year, married in a few months. Before engagement, they had a good sex life (3x a week), but after, it dropped to twice a year. The fianc\u00e9 initially blamed body image issues but later revealed she wants to wait until after marriage due to her Catholic background and feelings of guilt. The author didn't agree to this before marriage and is now resentful.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's look at both sides. The fianc\u00e9 changed her stance after engagement, which was a significant shift. The author didn't consent to this change beforehand. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 has her reasons rooted in her upbringing and personal beliefs. However, the key here is that the author didn't agree to this arrangement. The fianc\u00e9's decision to wait is her choice, but it affects the author's expectations and needs, which haven't been met. The author is upset because their expectations were not discussed upfront, leading to resentment.\n\nIn relationships, communication is crucial. The fianc\u00e9 did eventually explain her reasons, but the timing of this revelation (after engagement) might be an issue. The author is not wrong for feeling upset if they didn't agree to wait until marriage. The fianc\u00e9's choice is valid, but the author's feelings are also legitimate. The problem arises from the lack of prior agreement. Since the author didn't sign up for this arrangement, it's reasonable for them to feel wronged. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
