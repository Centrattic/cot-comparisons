Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is engaged and had a good sex life before the engagement, but after getting engaged, their fianc\u00e9e's sex drive dropped significantly. The fianc\u00e9e initially blamed body issues but later revealed she felt guilty because she didn't lose her virginity the way she wanted and wanted to wait until after marriage. The author is upset because they didn't agree to wait until marriage, and now they're resenting the change in dynamics.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the engagement context. When someone gets engaged, it's a big step, but in many relationships, expectations can change as they move forward. The fianc\u00e9e changed her stance on waiting until marriage after the engagement, which wasn't part of their initial agreement. The author is upset because their expectations weren't met, which is understandable. However, the fianc\u00e9e has her own reasons rooted in her religious background and personal feelings about her past. \n\nThe key points here are communication and consent. The author tried to respect her reasons at first but felt ignored when the issue persisted. The fianc\u00e9e eventually explained her deeper reasons, which include guilt from her Catholic upbringing and feeling that she should wait now. But the author didn't agree to this arrangement when they started dating or engaged. The dynamic changing significantly after engagement could be a point of contention. \n\nIn terms of morality, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. They communicated their needs, but the fianc\u00e9e's change in stance led to a shift that affects both partners. However, the author's resentment might be a result of unmet expectations. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to wait wasn't discussed before the engagement, so maybe the author is justified in feeling that they didn't sign up for that. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e's reasons are personal and valid, so the author's reaction might be seen as not respecting her boundaries now. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether the author's expectations were communicated and respected. Since the fianc\u00e9e changed her stance post-engagement without prior discussion, the author is not in the wrong for being upset. Both parties need to communicate and find a compromise, but the author's feelings are valid here. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
