Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 whose sex drive dropped after they got engaged. The author is upset because they used to have sex three times a week, but now it's only twice in a year. They confronted the fianc\u00e9, who explained it's because of her Catholic upbringing and wanting to wait until marriage, even though they both didn't choose that path initially.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault. Let's break it down. First, they were in a committed relationship and had a good sex life before engagement. After engagement, the fianc\u00e9's desire decreased. The author respected her initial reasons (body issues) but then found out it was about waiting until marriage. The author is now upset and feels resentful because they didn't agree to that arrangement upfront. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual understanding. The fianc\u00e9 didn't mention this religious hesitation before they got engaged, and now the author feels it's affecting their relationship. The author is within their rights to feel upset if their expectations were not met. However, the fianc\u00e9 is also within her rights to have her own beliefs and change her stance based on her background. \n\nBut wait, the author didn't sign up for waiting until marriage, so if the fianc\u00e9 changed her stance after the engagement, that's a significant shift. The author's resentment might be valid if they didn't have that conversation earlier. However, the fianc\u00e9's reasons are personal and rooted in her upbringing. It's a conflict between differing values that weren't fully discussed before the engagement. \n\nIn relationships, both partners need to communicate their needs and boundaries. If the fianc\u00e9 didn't make this clear before the engagement, the author might be justified in feeling wronged. On the other hand, the author should have addressed this earlier instead of letting it fester into resentment. But since the fianc\u00e9 only came forward with the real reason after some prying, maybe the communication wasn't adequate. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They're upset about a change in their partner's behavior without prior discussion. They might not be in the wrong because they had a different understanding. However, if the author didn't communicate their own needs regarding the sex life, that could be a factor. But the main issue is the fianc\u00e9's change in stance without prior agreement. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because the fianc\u00e9 didn't establish this boundary before the engagement, leading to a mismatch in expectations.\n"
