  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for wanting to have sex with my fiance?\nMy fiance and I have been engaged for a year and are getting married in a few months. Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a fianc\u00e9 whose sex drive dropped after engagement, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, the author is upset because their fianc\u00e9 suddenly wants to wait until marriage for sex, even though they both were not virgins and didn't choose that route before. The fianc\u00e9 cites Catholic background and guilt as reasons. The author feels resentful and is questioning if they're the asshole.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author had a good sex life before engagement but now it's almost non-existent. They respected the fianc\u00e9's initial reasons about body image but later found out it was about waiting until marriage. The author didn't agree with this change and is upset because it wasn't discussed before engagement. However, the fianc\u00e9 has her reasons rooted in her upbringing and current feelings.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, maybe the fianc\u00e9 should have addressed this issue earlier. The author didn't sign up for waiting until marriage, so a change in expectations post-engagement could be a problem. But the fianc\u00e9 is coming from a place of guilt and religious beliefs, which are personal and valid. The author is justified in feeling upset about the lack of communication and sudden shift. However, respecting her decision is important in a relationship. \n\nBut the question is about who is in the wrong. The author's resentment is understandable if the fianc\u00e9 changed her stance without prior discussion. However, the author might also need to consider compromise. It's a complex situation where both have valid points. The key is whether the author's feelings are justified. Since the fianc\u00e9 changed her mind post-engagement without prior discussion, the author's frustration is valid. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the author is reacting to a significant change in the relationship's terms after engagement, which wasn't discussed initially. The fianc\u00e9's reasons are personal, but the author has a right to be upset about the lack of communication.\n"
