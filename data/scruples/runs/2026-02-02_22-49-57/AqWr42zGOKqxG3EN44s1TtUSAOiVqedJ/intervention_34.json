Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The scenario involves a fianc\u00e9 whose sex drive has dropped significantly after engagement, leading to the author's frustration.\n\nFirst, the key points: The couple was engaged for a year, with a good sex life before engagement. After engagement, the fianc\u00e9e's libido dropped. She initially blamed body image issues but later revealed she wanted to wait until marriage due to religious upbringing and guilt. The author is upset because they didn't agree to this arrangement beforehand and now feel resentment.\n\nI need to assess both sides. The author isn't wrong for feeling upset if there was a sudden change without prior agreement. The fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after they were engaged, which could be a valid reason for the author's frustration. However, the fianc\u00e9e's reasons (religious guilt, wanting to wait) are personal and might be legitimate for her. \n\nBut the main issue is communication. They had conversations about the change, and the author respected her initial reasons. The key is whether the author is wrong to be upset. Since the author didn't agree to the change upfront, and the fianc\u00e9e decided this post-engagement, the author's frustration is understandable. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling this way. However, the answer might depend on cultural or personal values. In some contexts, waiting until marriage is expected, but the author didn't agree to that. So, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
