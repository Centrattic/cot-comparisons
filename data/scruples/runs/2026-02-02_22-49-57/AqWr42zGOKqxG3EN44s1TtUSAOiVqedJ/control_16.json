Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation. The author's fianc\u00e9e had a good sex life before engagement but it dropped after. She initially blamed body issues but later admitted she wanted to wait until after marriage due to her Catholic upbringing and guilt. The author is upset because they didn't agree to this beforehand, leading to resentment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author feels wronged because the change in their fianc\u00e9e's sex drive happened after engagement, not before they started dating. The fianc\u00e9e's reasons are based on her religious beliefs and personal guilt, which are valid for her. However, the author didn't consent to this change in the relationship terms. Communication is key here. Did the fianc\u00e9e discuss this with the author when she first felt the change, or did she keep it to herself? The author says they had conversations but she didn't disclose the real reason until later. Maybe the fianc\u00e9e should have been more transparent earlier. On the other hand, the author might have been too passive, not pushing harder for answers sooner. \n\nAlso, cultural and religious values can influence personal decisions, but relationships require mutual agreement. If the author didn't agree to waiting until after marriage, and the fianc\u00e9e only decided this post-engagement, that's a problem. The author's resentment comes from unmet expectations, which is understandable. However, the fianc\u00e9e's reasons are personal and important to her. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being upset. Since both parties have valid points, but the fianc\u00e9e's decision came after the engagement without prior agreement, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer might be B (No), but need to check if there's a flaw in this reasoning. Maybe the author should have communicated their needs better too. But the main issue is the fianc\u00e9e changing terms without prior discussion. So the author isn't wrong for being upset.\n"
