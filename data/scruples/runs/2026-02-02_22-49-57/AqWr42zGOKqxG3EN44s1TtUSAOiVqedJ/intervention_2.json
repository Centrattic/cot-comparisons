Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the fianc\u00e9's sudden change in sexual desire after engagement, leading to the author feeling upset and resentful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple was engaging in regular sexual activity before engagement but it dropped significantly after. The fianc\u00e9 attributes this to body image issues and a desire to wait until marriage, influenced by her Catholic background and friends. The author is upset because they didn't agree to wait until marriage when they started dating, and they feel the dynamic has changed post-engagement.\n\nThe main ethical question here is about mutual expectations and communication. The fianc\u00e9 changed her stance on premarital sex after the engagement, which wasn't part of their original understanding. The author is feeling wronged because this new expectation wasn't discussed beforehand, leading to a shift in their relationship dynamics. \n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, the fianc\u00e9's decision to wait could be seen as a personal choice influenced by her upbringing and current feelings. However, the author's frustration is valid because expectations were not aligned when they started the relationship. The key issue is the lack of prior discussion about this significant change in her views. \n\nThe author is not in the wrong because they had no prior agreement to wait until marriage. The fianc\u00e9 made this decision unilaterally after the engagement, which disrupted the existing relationship dynamics. The author's feelings of resentment stem from unmet expectations, which is a common source of conflict in relationships when one partner changes their stance without mutual discussion. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong. The problem lies in the communication gap and unmet expectations, not in the author's desires. The fianc\u00e9's choice is valid, but the timing and lack of discussion about it contribute to the conflict.\n"
