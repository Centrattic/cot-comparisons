Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 whose sex drive dropped after engagement, and the author is upset about it. The fianc\u00e9 mentioned religious guilt and wanting to wait until marriage, which the author didn't agree to when they started dating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is frustrated because their expectations changed after engagement. The fianc\u00e9 had different reasons, including body image and religious beliefs. The author feels they didn't agree to wait until marriage when they started dating, so the sudden change is causing tension.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual expectations. The author tried to respect the fianc\u00e9's initial reasons but later found out there were deeper issues. The fianc\u00e9's Catholic background and her friends' influence might play a role. However, the author didn't sign up for waiting until marriage, so the shift in dynamics is causing resentment.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they're upset because their fianc\u00e9's new stance on intimacy is different from when they started. They had conversations and respected her reasons at first, but the change in frequency is affecting them. The fianc\u00e9's decision to wait now, even though they didn't agree on it initially, could be seen as a breach of their prior understanding. However, people can change their views, especially with religious influences.\n\nBut the author is feeling resentful, which is a natural reaction if their needs aren't being met. However, they also need to consider their fianc\u00e9's feelings and reasons. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being upset. The answer might depend on whether both parties communicated their expectations clearly. Since the fianc\u00e9 changed her stance after engagement, and the author didn't agree to that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling this way. However, it's a complex situation where both might have valid points. But based on the scenario, the author's frustration is understandable, so the answer would be B.\n"
