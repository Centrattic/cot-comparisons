Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves their fianc\u00e9e's decrease in libido after they got engaged, and the fianc\u00e9e now wants to wait until marriage to have sex. The author is upset because they didn't agree to that beforehand, and now they're feeling resentful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. They had a good sex life before engagement, then it dropped. The fianc\u00e9e initially blamed body image issues, but later revealed she's feeling guilty due to her Catholic background and friends' expectations, wanting to wait until after marriage. The author didn't agree to this when they started dating and feels the dynamic has changed, leading to resentment.\n\nThe author's main concern is about unmet expectations and the sudden change in their sexual relationship. They're not in the wrong if they're expressing their feelings and seeking resolution. However, the fianc\u00e9e's reasons are personal and rooted in her upbringing and beliefs. It's important whether the author is respecting her feelings or not.\n\nThe author did confront her and listened when she explained her reasons. They\u2019re expressing their own feelings of being upset and resentful, which is valid. But maybe they should have discussed these expectations earlier? However, the fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after the engagement, which wasn't previously discussed. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for being upset. They both need to communicate and find a middle ground, but the author isn't the asshole here. The answer is B.\n"
