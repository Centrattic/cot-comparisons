Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is engaged to be married in a few months. They had a good sex life before engagement, but after getting engaged, the fianc\u00e9e's sex drive dropped significantly. The author respected her initial reasons like body image issues but noticed a big decrease in their sexual activity. After some time, the fianc\u00e9e admitted she feels guilty because she didn't lose her virginity the way she wanted and wants to wait until after marriage for future sex. The author is upset and feels resentful because they both didn't choose to wait and now the fianc\u00e9e is changing her stance, affecting their relationship.\n\nSo, the key points here are communication and expectations. When they started dating, neither of them chose to wait until marriage. The fianc\u00e9e's change in stance came after they got engaged. The author is feeling upset because their expectations about the relationship's physical intimacy have changed. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the fianc\u00e9e made a decision post-engagement that affects their relationship dynamics. The author is expressing their feelings of being upset and resentful, which is a valid emotional response. However, the fianc\u00e9e has her reasons rooted in her religious background and personal guilt. \n\nBut here's the thing: relationships require mutual understanding and communication. The author tried to respect her reasons initially but felt it's a change from when they started. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to wait now might not have been discussed before engagement, so the author might feel it's a new issue. However, the author is also expressing their dissatisfaction, which is their right. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether the fianc\u00e9e's decision was communicated earlier. Since she mentioned it after the sex drive dropped, maybe the author didn't have a chance to discuss it earlier. The author's resentment might be justified if they feel this change wasn't discussed upfront. But the fianc\u00e9e's reasons are personal and valid. \n\nSo, it's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset because their needs and expectations aren't being met. However, the fianc\u00e9e's reasons are also valid. The real issue might be communication. Since the author is expressing their feelings and seeking understanding, they aren't the asshole here. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
