Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about the engaged couple. The fianc\u00e9's sex drive dropped after they got engaged, and it turns out she's feeling guilty because of her Catholic background and wants to wait until marriage. The author is upset because they were having sex regularly before engagement but now she's changed her mind, leading to resentment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author didn't agree to wait until marriage when they started dating. They were having sex before engagement, and now she's decided to change things. The author feels wronged because the expectations shifted after the engagement. However, she came from a deeply religious background, which might have influenced her later decision. She also mentioned feeling guilty as the wedding approaches, which suggests it's a personal struggle.\n\nThe author is upset because their needs aren't being met, and their relationship dynamic has changed. But they did respect her initial reasons about body image. However, the new reason wasn't discussed before. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being upset.\n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to be upset if their expectations were different. On the other hand, she made a choice based on her beliefs, even if it's a recent change. The author might not be in the wrong because the expectations weren't aligned from the start. The fianc\u00e9 changed her stance without prior discussion, which could be seen as unfair. But the author also didn't press the issue initially, respecting her reasons. Now they're both dealing with the consequences.\n\nBut is the author overstepping? If they agreed to wait after the engagement, maybe not. However, they didn't agree to wait initially. The key point is that the engaged couple's expectations shifted without mutual agreement. The author's resentment is valid if they didn't expect to wait, but the fianc\u00e9's reasons are personal. It's a conflict of values and expectations. The author might not be the asshole because they didn't agree to the change, but maybe they should have addressed it earlier. However, the answer hinges on whether the author is wrong to be upset. Since they didn't agree to the new terms, and it's affecting their relationship, the answer might be B (No).\n"
