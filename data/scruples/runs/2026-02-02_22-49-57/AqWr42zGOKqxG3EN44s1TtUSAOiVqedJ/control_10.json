Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a fianc\u00e9 whose partner's sex drive has dropped after they got engaged. The author is upset because the fianc\u00e9e is now wanting to wait until after marriage to have sex, even though they both weren't virgins when they started dating. The fianc\u00e9e's reasons include her Catholic background and guilt about losing her virginity in the way she wanted with her previous boyfriend. The author feels wronged because they didn't agree to wait until marriage at the start, and now the dynamic has changed, leading to resentment.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are communication and expectations. When they started dating, neither wanted to wait until marriage, so there was no prior agreement. After engagement, the fianc\u00e9e changed her stance. The author is upset because this change is causing a decline in their sexual relationship. The fianc\u00e9e's reasons are personal and tied to her religious upbringing and personal feelings about her past. \n\nThe author is expressing frustration and resentment, which is a valid emotion when expectations change. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9e had the right to change her mind about her personal boundaries, even if it wasn't discussed beforehand. The author respected her initial reasons (body issues) and waited patiently. However, the author might feel that their needs aren't being met now because of this change. \n\nIn relationships, both partners' needs should be considered. If the fianc\u00e9e's decision is causing significant distress and the author feels they can't meet in the middle, there might be issues in communication or alignment of expectations. But since the author initiated discussions and the fianc\u00e9e was honest about her reasons, the fault isn't entirely on one side. However, the author's resentment and surprise at the change could indicate that they didn't fully consider that personal values might evolve. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author is wrong for feeling upset. Since the fianc\u00e9e changed her stance without prior agreement, the author's feelings are understandable. However, if the author can't adapt to this change and it's leading to resentment, maybe they share some responsibility for not discussing long-term expectations earlier. But given the scenario, the author's frustration is valid. The fianc\u00e9e's change in perspective is personal, and the author is reacting to that. It's not that the author is wrong, but maybe there's a need for mutual adjustment. The question is whether the author is the asshole. If the author is respecting her reasons but still feels wronged, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong. Alternatively, if the author is being selfish about their needs versus respecting her new beliefs, maybe they are. But considering all factors, the answer is likely B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because they have valid reasons for their feelings and they tried to communicate and respect her initial reasons.\n"
