Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the fianc\u00e9's sex drive dropped significantly after they got engaged. The author says they used to have sex three times a week before engagement, but now it's twice in a year. The fianc\u00e9 initially blamed body issues but later admitted she wants to wait until after marriage because of her Catholic background and friends' influence. The author is upset and feels resentful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations both parties had. When they started dating, neither chose to wait until marriage. The change happened after engagement. The author didn't sign up for that, so maybe there's an unmet expectation here. But the fianc\u00e9 has her reasons rooted in her upbringing and personal beliefs. She's feeling guilty now that the wedding is near. \n\nIs the author wrong for being upset? Well, the fianc\u00e9 did change her stance after the engagement, which the author didn't anticipate. The author respected her body issues at first but felt ignored when it turned out to be about waiting. The author's frustration is about a shift in the relationship dynamic. But does that make them the asshole? Or is the fianc\u00e9 not communicating her needs effectively?\n\nThe author is in a committed relationship, engaged, but suddenly the fianc\u00e9 wants to change the terms. The author's resentment might be valid if communication was lacking. However, the fianc\u00e9's reasons are personal and religious. It's a conflict between expectations. The author isn't wrong for feeling upset, but maybe there's a mutual responsibility here. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author didn't agree to wait until marriage initially and the fianc\u00e9 changed her mind after engagement, the author's frustration is understandable. The fianc\u00e9's actions might be selfish in changing terms without considering the impact. So, probably the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
