Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 whose sex drive dropped after the engagement, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, the couple had a good sex life before engagement but now it's twice in a year. The fianc\u00e9e cited body image issues at first, then later revealed she's feeling guilty about not saving her virginity for marriage. Her religious background and friends' expectations play a role here. The author is upset because they didn't agree on waiting until marriage when they started dating, and now the dynamic has changed, causing resentment.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. The author's frustration is valid if they didn't agree on this change. The fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after engagement, which might not have been communicated clearly upfront. However, her reasons are personal and tied to her values and background. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? They wanted to have sex, which is understandable. But they should also respect her feelings and reasons. However, the key point is that the change in expectations happened after the engagement without prior discussion. The author might not be in the wrong because they had no prior agreement. But maybe they should have discussed this more before engagement? Or maybe the fianc\u00e9e should have communicated her feelings earlier. \n\nThe question is whether the author is the asshole. The answer hinges on whether the author's resentment is justified given the lack of prior agreement. If the author didn't know about her intention to wait until marriage before engagement, then their frustration is reasonable. However, if they should have discussed expectations around intimacy when they got engaged, maybe they share some responsibility. \n\nBut the main issue is the change in behavior after the engagement. The fianc\u00e9e's guilt and religious background are her personal reasons. The author's resentment comes from unmet expectations. Since there was no prior agreement, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, the situation is complex and both sides have valid points. The answer depends on whether the author is at fault for not discussing this before engagement. Since the fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after the engagement, and the author didn't know, the author might not be the asshole. So the answer is B (No).\n"
