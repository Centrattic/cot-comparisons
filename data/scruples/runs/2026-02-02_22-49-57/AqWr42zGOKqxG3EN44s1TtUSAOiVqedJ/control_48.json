Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nSo, the author and their fianc\u00e9e have been engaged for a year, set to marry soon. Initially, they had a good sex life, but after engagement, her sex drive dropped. She cited body image issues and minor health issues like psoriasis. The author respected that but noticed a significant decrease in frequency. Later, the fianc\u00e9e revealed that she now wants to wait until marriage for sex because of her Catholic background and feelings of guilt as the wedding approaches. The author is upset, feels a change in their dynamic, and is developing resentment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's frustration is understandable. They mention they didn't agree to wait until marriage when they started dating, so this new boundary is a surprise. The fianc\u00e9e changed her stance post-engagement, which the author didn't consent to. Communication is key here. The fianc\u00e9e did talk about her reasons, but the author feels it's a recent development that's affecting their relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e's reasons are personal and rooted in her religious beliefs and values. She's coming to terms with her past and wants to align her actions with her current beliefs. It's possible she's struggling with guilt or pressure from her upbringing. The author is now in a conflict between respecting her wishes and their own needs.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The author's resentment comes from unmet expectations and a lack of prior agreement. However, the fianc\u00e9e's decision, while affecting the relationship, might be genuine. The answer depends on whether the author's frustration is justified given the circumstances. Since both have valid points, but the author's resentment stems from a lack of prior discussion, it's possible the author isn't in the wrong, but the situation is complex. However, the author might need to address this through further communication rather than resentment.\n"
