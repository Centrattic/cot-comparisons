Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation. The author and their fianc\u00e9e have been engaged for a year, and their sex life decreased after engagement. The fianc\u00e9e initially blamed body issues but later admitted she's waiting until marriage due to her Catholic background and guilt. The author feels upset and even resentful because this wasn't discussed before engagement and now they're expected to wait.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is frustrated because their expectations changed after engagement. They didn't sign up for waiting until marriage, so the sudden shift might feel unfair. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e's reasons are based on her religious beliefs and personal guilt, which can be valid. However, the key point is communication. Did they talk about this before getting engaged? If not, it's possible the author didn't realize this would be an issue. But since the fianc\u00e9e only mentioned it after engagement, the author isn't necessarily wrong to feel upset if this wasn't discussed upfront. Relationships need mutual understanding and boundaries set early on. The author's resentment might stem from unmet expectations and lack of prior discussion. The fianc\u00e9e's change in behavior post-engagement could be seen as a shift in priorities, which the author has a right to be concerned about. So, the author isn't in the wrong because they're expressing valid feelings about a change that affects their relationship. The answer is B.\n"
