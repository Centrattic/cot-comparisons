Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the fianc\u00e9's sex drive dropped after engagement, and she now wants to wait until marriage because of her Catholic background and guilt. The author feels upset and developing resentment because they didn't agree to wait until marriage when they started dating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is engaged, and had a good sex life before engagement. Now, the fianc\u00e9 is pulling back, citing religious reasons and body image issues. The author feels they didn't sign up for waiting until marriage, so the change is causing tension.\n\nI should think about communication and expectations. When they got engaged, maybe they didn't discuss marital expectations around intimacy. The fianc\u00e9's reasons are personal, rooted in her upbringing and beliefs. She did communicate her feelings eventually, but the author feels blindsided. \n\nIs the author wrong for feeling upset? Well, they had a different understanding initially. If they both didn't agree to wait until marriage at the start, then the fianc\u00e9 changing her stance after engagement could disrupt their dynamic. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for being upset, as unmet expectations can lead to valid feelings of resentment. However, the fianc\u00e9's reasons are personal and she did try to explain them. The key is whether the author is being unreasonable in their reaction. \n\nBut the question is about being \"in the wrong.\" If the author's feelings are valid because expectations were not aligned, then they aren't in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9 made a decision post-engagement, which the author now feels is altering their relationship. So the answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
