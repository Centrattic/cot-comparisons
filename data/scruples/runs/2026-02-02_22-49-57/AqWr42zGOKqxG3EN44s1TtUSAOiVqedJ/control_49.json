Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's fianc\u00e9e suddenly losing interest in sex after getting engaged, which he later finds out is because she wants to wait until marriage due to religious upbringing and guilt. The author is upset and feels resentful because they didn't agree to this beforehand.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is justified in feeling frustrated because their needs and expectations for intimacy have changed. The fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after engagement, which might not have been communicated earlier. However, the fianc\u00e9e has her own reasons rooted in her background, and she might be struggling with her feelings.\n\nBut the key points are: the author didn't agree to waiting until marriage, the change happened after engagement, leading to a significant decrease in intimacy. The author is upset because their expectations weren't met. The fianc\u00e9e's reasons are valid to her, but the author didn't sign up for that. \n\nThe question is if the author is in the wrong. If the fianc\u00e9e suddenly changed her stance without prior discussion, leading to a major shift in their relationship dynamic, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. The fianc\u00e9e's reasons are personal, but the author's feelings are also valid. So the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They have a right to feel upset if their partner's expectations changed without mutual agreement.\n"
