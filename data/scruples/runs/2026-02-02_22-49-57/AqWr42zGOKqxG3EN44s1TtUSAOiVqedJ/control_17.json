Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person in this situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again carefully.\n\nThe user is engaged and has been with their fianc\u00e9e for a year. They were having sex three times a week before engagement but now only twice in the past year. The fianc\u00e9e initially blamed body image issues but later admitted she feels pressure from her Catholic upbringing and her friends to wait until marriage. She didn't lose her virginity the way she wanted with her ex, so she wants to wait now. The user is upset because they didn't agree to this arrangement when they started dating. They feel their dynamic has changed and they're resentful.\n\nFirst, I should consider both perspectives. The user is upset about the lack of sexual activity and the sudden change in her stance. The fianc\u00e9e is dealing with personal values and guilt, influenced by her background. The user didn't sign up for abstinence pre-marriage, so they feel wronged. Did they have a prior agreement? No, the change came after engagement. The fianc\u00e9e's reasons are personal and cultural, but the user is now conflicted.\n\nIs the user in the wrong? Well, they have the right to be concerned about their needs in the relationship. However, the fianc\u00e9e is also making a decision based on her values. The user respected her initial reasons (body issues) but later felt it was a different issue. The key here is communication. The user addressed it, and she explained her reasons. The user is frustrated because the agreement wasn't mutual from the start. But in a relationship, both partners' values can evolve. The user's resentment might be valid if they feel their needs are being neglected. However, the fianc\u00e9e is making a choice based on her beliefs. The question is whether the user is the asshole for feeling resentful and upset. It's a complex situation where both have valid points. The answer might depend on whether the user's expectations were communicated and if the fianc\u00e9e's choice was made known sooner. Since the change happened post-engagement, the user's reaction could be seen as justified because the terms of their relationship's sexual aspect changed without prior agreement. So the user isn't necessarily in the wrong. But if the fianc\u00e9e didn't make her intentions clear earlier, maybe the user's resentment is understandable. Alternatively, the user should have discussed their needs more proactively. Hmm. It's a tough call. I think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the user is expressing their feelings and the fianc\u00e9e made a change after the engagement, not beforehand. The user's reaction is about their own needs and expectations not being met, which is valid unless there was an explicit agreement. Since there wasn't, the answer is B.\n"
