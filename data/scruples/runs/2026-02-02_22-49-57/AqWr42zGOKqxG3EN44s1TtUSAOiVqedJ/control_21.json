Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 whose sex drive has dropped significantly after the engagement, and the author is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both perspectives. The author mentions that before engagement, their sex life was good, but after engagement, it plummeted. The fianc\u00e9 initially blamed body image issues but later admitted to feeling guilty due to her Catholic upbringing and wanting to wait until marriage. The author didn't know about this until after the engagement and now feels resentful because they didn't agree to wait until marriage initially.\n\nSo, the key points here are communication and mutual expectations. When they started dating, neither of them chose to wait until marriage. The fianc\u00e9's change in stance came after the engagement. The author feels misled or that the expectations changed without prior agreement. The fianc\u00e9 is dealing with personal feelings and religious guilt, which is valid, but the timing of when she decided to change her stance is important. \n\nThe author's frustration is understandable because they had a certain expectation based on their previous relationship. However, the fianc\u00e9's reasons are personal and tied to her beliefs. The question is whether the author is wrong for being upset. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, if both partners agreed on a certain dynamic when they started dating, and one changes expectations later without prior discussion, the other might feel betrayed or frustrated. However, the fianc\u00e9 did have her own reasons, and the author respected her initial body image concerns. The problem is that the new reason came after the engagement, which might not have been discussed beforehand. \n\nThe author's resentment could stem from feeling that the terms of their relationship are changing without mutual agreement. However, the fianc\u00e9 is also dealing with personal issues and her own convictions. It's a conflict between the author's needs and the fianc\u00e9's personal beliefs. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both might have some accountability here. The fianc\u00e9 should have communicated her feelings about waiting until marriage earlier, especially since it's a significant change. The author might be in the right to feel upset if there was no prior agreement. However, the author also needs to consider the fianc\u00e9's beliefs and whether they can adjust their expectations. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main issue is that the change in the fianc\u00e9's stance happened after the engagement, leading to a conflict in expectations. If the author didn't agree to wait until marriage from the start, then the fianc\u00e9 changing her mind now could be seen as a breach of mutual understanding. However, the author is also expected to respect her feelings and beliefs, even if they lead to a change in the relationship dynamic. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author's frustration is justified. They are allowed to feel upset if the expectations changed without discussion. However, if the fianc\u00e9's reasons are valid and she communicated them now, the author needs to navigate this with understanding. But the author isn't wrong for being upset because they had a prior agreement (or lack thereof) that's now being altered. So, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong because they have valid reasons for feeling frustrated given the circumstances.\n"
