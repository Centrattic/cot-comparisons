Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's fianc\u00e9e suddenly losing interest in sex after they got engaged, leading to the author feeling upset and resentful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple was already having a good sex life before the engagement. After engagement, the fianc\u00e9e's sex drive dropped, and she initially attributed it to body image issues. The author gave her space, but over time, the frequency of sex decreased further. Eventually, she revealed that she didn't lose her virginity the way she wanted with her previous boyfriend and now wants to wait until after marriage. She comes from a Catholic background, which adds to her guilt as the wedding approaches.\n\nThe author is upset because they didn't agree to wait until marriage when they started dating. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to change her stance post-engagement is causing conflict. The author feels they signed up for a different dynamic and now resents the change.\n\nNow, evaluating if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are mutual expectations and communication. When they got engaged, there wasn't a prior agreement about waiting until marriage. The fianc\u00e9e changed her approach after the engagement, which the author finds surprising and upsetting. The author's feelings of being upset and resentful are valid because they expected a certain level of sexual activity and now feel it's been significantly reduced without prior agreement.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e's reasons are rooted in personal and religious beliefs. She's experiencing guilt and body image issues, which are legitimate factors affecting her. However, the timing of her decision to change their relationship's dynamic post-engagement is a problem. Both partners need to have open communication and possibly adjust expectations, but the author isn't necessarily wrong for feeling upset, especially if they didn't agree to this change beforehand.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. The issue stems from a lack of prior agreement and sudden change in expectations. The answer should be B (No).\n"
