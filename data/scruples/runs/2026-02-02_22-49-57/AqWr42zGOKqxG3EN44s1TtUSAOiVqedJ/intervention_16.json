Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is engaged, and before the engagement, they had a good sex life, about three times a week. After getting engaged, the fianc\u00e9e's sex drive dropped, and now they have sex maybe twice in a year. The fianc\u00e9e first blamed body image issues like weight gain and psoriasis, but after more discussion, she revealed she didn't lose her virginity the way she wanted with her last boyfriend and now wants to wait until after marriage. She comes from a religious Catholic background and feels guilty as the wedding approaches. The author is upset, feels resentment, and is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for being upset. They respect waiting until marriage but didn't agree to it when they started dating, and the fianc\u00e9e only brought it up after engagement.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to decide between A (yes) and B (no).\n\nFirst, I should consider the key points. The author and fianc\u00e9e didn't discuss this before engagement. The change in the sex drive happened after engagement, which the fianc\u00e9e now attributes to religious beliefs and personal issues. The author is upset because their expectations for intimacy have changed, and they're developing resentment. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The fianc\u00e9e did eventually explain her reasons, which is good, but she didn't bring it up until after the engagement. The author felt blindsided because they didn't agree to this when they started the relationship. The author's feelings of being upset or resentful are valid if their needs aren't being met. However, the fianc\u00e9e has her own reasons rooted in her background and personal trauma. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for being upset? Well, the author is expressing their feelings about a change in the relationship that affects them. The fianc\u00e9e's choice to wait might be valid for her, but the author's feelings of being hurt or resentful because of this unmet need could be understandable. The problem is that the fianc\u00e9e only brought this up after the engagement, which might have been a surprise to the author. \n\nBut in terms of right and wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling upset. However, maybe the author should have addressed the issue sooner or explored solutions with their fianc\u00e9e. But the fianc\u00e9e's reasons are personal and valid, so the author's resentment might not be entirely her fault. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is in the wrong if they expected the relationship to continue as before. But since the fianc\u00e9e had her reasons, the author's frustration is about unmet expectations. The question is whether the author is the asshole. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is on whether the person's actions or feelings make them the asshole. The author hasn't done anything wrong; they're just feeling upset about their partner's change in behavior. The fianc\u00e9e's decision is her choice, but the author is allowed to feel hurt. The author isn't the asshole for being upset, but maybe they need to communicate better. \n\nSo the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
