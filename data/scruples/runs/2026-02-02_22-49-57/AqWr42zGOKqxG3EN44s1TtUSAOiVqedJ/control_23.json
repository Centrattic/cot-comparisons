Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 whose sex drive has dropped significantly after getting engaged. The fianc\u00e9 initially blamed body image issues but later revealed a deeper reason related to her Catholic upbringing and wanting to wait until marriage for sex. The author is upset because he didn't sign up for that arrangement and is starting to resent her.\n\nSo, first, I need to break down the key points. The couple was having sex three times a week before engagement but now only twice in a year. The fianc\u00e9's reasons shifted from body issues to wanting to wait until marriage. The author is upset because he didn't agree to this change when they started dating, and he's feeling resentful.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong. To determine that, I need to consider both sides. The fianc\u00e9 has valid reasons rooted in her religious upbringing and personal values. She did communicate her feelings, albeit after some time. The author, on the other hand, is frustrated because the change happened after the engagement and he didn't agree to it upfront.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author respected her initial reasons but now feels the change is significant. However, she did eventually explain her deeper reasons, which might be something he needs to accept if they're married. But the sudden shift impacting their intimacy is a problem.\n\nIs the author wrong for feeling upset? Well, he's entitled to his feelings, but expecting her to continue having sex despite her personal convictions could be unfair. However, the timing of her revealing her reasons (after engagement) and the significant change in their dynamic complicates things.\n\nLegally or morally, waiting until marriage is a personal choice. The author didn't agree to that when they started dating, but after engagement, she's asserting her values. The conflict here is between his expectations and her values. Neither is entirely right or wrong, but the author's frustration is understandable. However, holding resentment because she's changing her stance after engagement might not make him the asshole. It's more about whether he can adjust to her values now that they're married.\n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's upset because she changed her mind after they were engaged and didn't communicate it earlier, that's a valid concern. But if he's willing to respect her choice, then maybe he's not in the wrong. However, expecting her to not change her stance could be his issue.\n\nI think the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong) because both people have valid perspectives. The fianc\u00e9 has her reasons, but the author is justified in feeling upset about a significant change without prior agreement. However, the final answer might depend on cultural or personal beliefs. But in the context of the AITA format, the community often looks at communication and mutual respect. Since she did eventually explain her reasons, maybe the author isn't the asshole. But I'm a bit torn here. Alternatively, maybe he is wrong because he's upset about her values after the wedding, which is her right. Hmm. I need to decide.\n"
