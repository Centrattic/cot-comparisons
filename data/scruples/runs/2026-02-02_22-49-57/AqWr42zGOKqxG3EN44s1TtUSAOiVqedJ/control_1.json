Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a fianc\u00e9 whose sex drive has decreased after engagement, and the author feels upset about it, leading to resentment. The fianc\u00e9 gives reasons like body image and Catholic upbringing, and decided to wait until marriage. The author is upset because they didn't agree to that initially.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The couple was having sex regularly before engagement but not after. The fianc\u00e9's reasons for the change are body issues and religious beliefs. The author didn't know about the religious aspect until after engagement. They feel wronged because the decision to wait wasn't mutual from the start.\n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics. Communication is a big part here. The author says they respected her initial reasons but later confronted her. The fianc\u00e9's change in stance after engagement could be a problem if it wasn't discussed earlier. However, the author also didn't express their needs clearly, leading to resentment. Both parties might have responsibilities here. The author's resentment is valid if they felt misled, but the fianc\u00e9's reasons are personal and valid too. However, the key issue is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the fianc\u00e9's decision came after engagement and wasn't part of the initial agreement, the author's frustration is understandable. But the author might be in the wrong if they didn't address it sooner or if they're now holding it against her. Alternatively, the fianc\u00e9's sudden change without prior discussion could be the issue. It's a bit of a gray area. The author's resentment might indicate a lack of negotiation. But the question is whether the author is the asshole. If the author didn't agree to wait and the fianc\u00e9 changed the terms, the author isn't wrong. But if they should have communicated better, maybe they share some blame. Hmm. The answer might hinge on whether the author's expectations were communicated. If the author didn't express their needs, maybe they share some responsibility. However, the fianc\u00e9's decision post-engagement without prior discussion could make the author justified in feeling upset. But the question is about being in the wrong. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. I think the answer is B (No), because both parties have valid points, but the author isn't necessarily wrong for feeling upset. The fianc\u00e9 made a decision that affects the relationship without prior agreement, leading to the author's frustration. So the author isn't the asshole.\n"
