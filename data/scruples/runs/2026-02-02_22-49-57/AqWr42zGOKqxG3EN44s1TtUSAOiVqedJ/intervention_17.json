Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's fianc\u00e9e suddenly losing interest in sex after they got engaged, with reasons tied to her Catholic background and wanting to wait until marriage. The author is upset and possibly resentful.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The fianc\u00e9e's behavior changed after engagement, not before. They had a good sex life prior. She mentioned body image issues initially, but later admitted it's about waiting until marriage. The author feels they didn't agree to this arrangement and is now resentful. \n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9e changed her stance post-engagement, which wasn't discussed beforehand. The author is respecting her reasons but is distressed because it wasn't an agreement they made when they started dating. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The fianc\u00e9e didn't bring up her desire to wait until marriage before the engagement. The author might feel blindsided, especially since their expectations were set before the engagement. However, the fianc\u00e9e is now acting on her personal beliefs and values. \n\nThe author's resentment comes from a shift in the relationship dynamic that wasn't mutual. The fianc\u00e9e is following her religious and personal convictions, which the author needs to respect. But if this was a deal-breaker for the author, they should have addressed it earlier. However, the author tried to respect her reasons initially but now feels wronged. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit complex. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling upset if this wasn't discussed before the engagement. However, the fianc\u00e9e's reasons are personal and valid. The author might need to consider if this is something they can accept or if it's a fundamental issue. \n\nSince the answer is binary (A or B), I think the author isn't in the wrong because the fianc\u00e9e changed her stance post-engagement without prior discussion. The author's feelings are valid given the lack of prior agreement. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
