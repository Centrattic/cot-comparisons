Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a fianc\u00e9 whose sex drive dropped significantly after engagement, leading to the author's frustration.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple was engaged for a year, with a good sex life before engagement. After engagement, the fianc\u00e9e's sex drive decreased. The author respected her initial reasons (body image issues) but later found out she's conflicted about having sex before marriage due to her Catholic background and friends' views. The author is upset because the expectation of waiting until marriage wasn't discussed before engagement, and now they're feeling resentful.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is wrong for feeling this way. The user wants a binary answer: A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong).\n\nI should consider communication in relationships. The fianc\u00e9e didn't disclose her feelings about waiting until marriage until after they were engaged. The author might feel misled if this was a new factor affecting their relationship. However, the fianc\u00e9e's reasons are personal and rooted in her upbringing and current feelings of guilt. The author has a right to be upset if their expectations were not met, but they also need to respect her boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might be in the wrong if they didn't address the issue earlier. The fianc\u00e9e had valid reasons for her change, and the author's resentment might stem from unmet expectations that weren't discussed. However, since the fianc\u00e9e introduced a new dynamic post-engagement, the author's frustration is understandable. The key here is whether the author is responsible for not addressing the issue sooner or if the fianc\u00e9e should have communicated her feelings earlier.\n\nI think the answer leans towards B (not wrong). The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling upset. The fianc\u00e9e's new stance came after engagement, and the author had a right to express their feelings. However, the situation is complex, and both parties need to communicate better. The author's resentment is a reaction to a significant change in their relationship's dynamics, which wasn't expected or discussed beforehand. So, the author isn't the asshole here.\n"
