Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a fianc\u00e9 whose sex drive dropped significantly after the engagement, and now he's upset about it. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple was already having sex regularly before the engagement, but after getting engaged, the fianc\u00e9e's interest decreased. She initially blamed body image issues, but later confessed that she's feeling guilty about having had premarital sex and now wants to wait until after marriage. The author is upset because they didn't agree to wait until marriage when they started dating, and now the change is causing tension and resentment.\n\nSo, the main issue here is about mutual expectations in a relationship. The author didn't sign up for waiting until marriage, and neither did his fianc\u00e9e. They were both okay with having sex before marriage when they started the relationship. Now, post-engagement, her stance has changed, which is affecting the relationship dynamics. \n\nI should think about consent and communication. The fianc\u00e9e didn't mention this desire to wait until after marriage before they got engaged. The author respected her initial reasons but now feels blindsided. The change in her behavior after the engagement could be seen as a shift in her personal values, possibly influenced by her religious background. However, the author is justified in feeling upset because their expectations were not aligned from the start, and the sudden change is causing emotional distance and resentment.\n\nAnother angle is about the timing of the revelation. If she knew her Catholic upbringing and potential guilt about premarital sex were going to affect her sexual desire, she should have communicated that earlier. The author might feel that this is a new and significant factor that was kept from him, leading to the current conflict. \n\nAlso, the fact that she's changing her stance after the engagement complicates things. The author might feel that the commitment of marriage was supposed to be a mutual decision, but now one party is imposing new conditions that weren't discussed before. The resentment he's feeling is understandable because the dynamic of their relationship has changed without prior agreement.\n\nHowever, it's also important to consider her perspective. She might be struggling with her religious beliefs and personal values, which are causing her internal conflict. The author is trying to respect her reasons but is frustrated because they didn't align their expectations before the engagement. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling upset. The problem stems from a lack of communication and differing expectations. If they had discussed their views on sex and marriage before getting engaged, they might have avoided this situation. But since she changed her stance after the engagement, and he's now dealing with the consequences, it's a valid source of conflict. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the issue is more about unmet expectations and communication gaps rather than the author acting in a wrong way. His feelings of resentment are justified given the change in circumstances without prior agreement.\n"
