Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's fianc\u00e9e changing her stance on having sex after they got engaged. Before engagement, they had a good sex life, but after engagement, it dropped. The fianc\u00e9e initially blamed body issues but later confessed she didn't lose her virginity how she wanted and now wants to wait until marriage because of her Catholic background and friends' influence. The author feels upset and starting to resent her for this change.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The engagement was a year ago, and the change happened after that. The author and fianc\u00e9e were both not virgins when they started dating and didn't agree to wait until marriage. Now, she's decided to wait, which is causing conflict. The author is upset because their expectations were different.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the fianc\u00e9e changed her stance without prior agreement. The author respected her initial reasons (body image) but later found it was due to different factors. The author's feelings of resentment are valid if the expectations were unmet. However, the fianc\u00e9e is now choosing to wait, which might be her right, considering her beliefs. The author might not be in the wrong for feeling upset, especially since the change came after the engagement and affected their relationship dynamic. But maybe the author should have discussed boundaries earlier. However, the fianc\u00e9e didn't disclose her reasons until later, which complicates things. The key is whether the author's feelings of resentment make them the asshole. It's a personal conflict where both have valid points, but the author is expressing their hurt, which isn't necessarily wrong. So, the answer is B (No).\n"
