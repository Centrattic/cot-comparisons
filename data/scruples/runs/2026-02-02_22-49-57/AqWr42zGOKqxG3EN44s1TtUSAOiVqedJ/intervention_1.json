Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is engaged and upset because their fianc\u00e9e's sex drive has dropped significantly since the engagement. Initially, the fianc\u00e9e attributed it to body image issues, but later revealed she's feeling guilty due to her religious background and wants to wait until after marriage for sex. The author is frustrated because they didn't agree to wait until marriage and feels their dynamic has changed, leading to resentment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key factors here. The couple had a good sex life before engagement but not after. The fianc\u00e9e's reasons are personal and rooted in her upbringing and religion, which is valid. The author is upset because they didn't agree to this change when they started dating. But the change happened after engagement, which is a different phase in the relationship. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for being upset? Well, they have a right to feel their needs are not being met. However, the fianc\u00e9e's feelings of guilt and religious beliefs are also valid. The author didn't sign up for waiting until marriage, but they also didn't communicate their needs effectively. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being upset or for not understanding her reasons. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9e made a sudden decision after engagement, which might have come as a surprise. The author might feel that their expectations were not discussed beforehand. However, the fianc\u00e9e's reasons are personal and should be respected. The author's resentment could stem from unmet expectations, but that doesn't necessarily mean they're in the wrong. \n\nIt's a complex situation where both parties have valid points. The author isn't wrong for feeling upset, but they might need to address the communication gap. However, the fianc\u00e9e's decision is her own right, even if it's causing strain. So, the answer likely is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
