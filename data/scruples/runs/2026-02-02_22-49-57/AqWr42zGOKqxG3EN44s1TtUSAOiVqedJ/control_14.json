Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author wanting to have sex with their fianc\u00e9e, but she's lost interest after they got engaged. She cites body image issues and religious guilt about not waiting until marriage. The author is upset because they didn't agree to wait until marriage when they started dating, and now the engagement has changed things.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple had a good sex life before engagement but it dropped after. The fianc\u00e9e's reasons include body issues and religious guilt. The author feels they didn't agree to abstinence and now feels resented. \n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, communication is key. The fianc\u00e9e did talk about her reasons, which include her Catholic background and personal feelings. The author respected her initial reasons but is now upset because the frequency of their sex life has decreased significantly. However, the fianc\u00e9e later brings up the religious aspect as a new reason. It's possible she's dealing with internal conflicts about her choices, which might affect her libido. \n\nThe author is frustrated because they didn't make a prenuptial agreement or an understanding about waiting. But since they didn't agree to that when they started dating, the fianc\u00e9e's change in stance post-engagement is a new development. The author's resentment comes from unmet expectations. However, the fianc\u00e9e's reasons are personal and rooted in her upbringing and current feelings. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? They didn't force the fianc\u00e9e to change her mind and tried to respect her initial reasons. However, they're now upset that the situation has evolved. The fianc\u00e9e might have a right to her religious convictions, even if it changes their relationship dynamic. The author might feel wronged because the expectations shifted without prior agreement, but the fianc\u00e9e's reasons are valid for her. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both might have a role. The author could have addressed the issue sooner, but the fianc\u00e9e's reasons are personal. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for feeling upset. The answer might hinge on mutual respect and communication. Since the fianc\u00e9e is acting on her beliefs and the author is reacting to a change in expectations, it's a complex situation. However, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to have sex; it's about differing needs and expectations. The fianc\u00e9e's reasons are her own, so the author's frustration isn't entirely their fault. Therefore, the answer might be B (No).\n"
