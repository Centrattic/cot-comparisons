Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 whose sex drive dropped after they got engaged, and now he's feeling upset and resentful because she wants to wait until marriage for sex. The question is whether he's the asshole (AITA) for being upset.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author mentions that before the engagement, they had a good sex life, three times a week. After engagement, it dropped to twice in a year. He tried talking to her, and she initially blamed body image issues but later admitted that she's Catholic, comes from a religious background, and feels guilty because she didn't lose her virginity the way she wanted with her last boyfriend. Now that the wedding is near, she wants to wait until after marriage. The author is upset because they didn't agree to wait until marriage when they started dating, and now this change is causing tension. He's starting to resent her for it.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Let's think. The key points here are communication, expectations, and mutual respect. When they got engaged, maybe there was an unspoken agreement about their sexual relationship, but it seems like the fianc\u00e9e changed her stance later. The author is frustrated because the dynamic has shifted without prior agreement. However, the fianc\u00e9e has her reasons rooted in her personal and religious beliefs. She came forward with her feelings after being confronted, which shows she tried to communicate, albeit not immediately. \n\nThe author is upset because he feels this change was not discussed earlier. But did he have a right to expect that the frequency of their sex life would stay the same? Maybe they should have had an open conversation about their expectations when they got engaged. However, the fianc\u00e9e did mention body image issues first, which is a common reason for a decrease in libido. He respected that and didn't push, which is good. Now, she's revealing deeper reasons tied to her religious beliefs and feelings of guilt. \n\nIs the author wrong for being upset? Well, his feelings are valid. He's entered into a relationship with certain expectations, and a significant change in intimacy can affect his emotions. However, the fianc\u00e9e is also trying to navigate her own feelings and beliefs. The question is whether he's in the wrong for being upset or if both sides need to work through this. \n\nBut the question specifically is whether he's in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for being upset, but maybe he's not handling it correctly. However, the core issue is the change in expectations after engagement. Since they didn't discuss this before the engagement, and she only revealed the reason later, it's a mutual issue. The author's resentment is understandable, but it's not entirely his fault. However, the fianc\u00e9e also needs to take responsibility for not communicating her feelings sooner. \n\nIn the AITA format, the focus is on whether the person asking is the asshole. The author is asking if he's the asshole for being upset. The answer would depend on whether his reaction is justified. Since the fianc\u00e9e has valid reasons and the author is respecting her choice now but is upset about the change, it's a complex situation. But since the question is about the author's wrongdoing, and he's not violating any moral code by being upset, the answer is likely B (he's not in the wrong). However, some might argue that he should have discussed expectations earlier. But given the scenario, the answer is probably B.\n"
