Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 whose sex drive dropped after the engagement, and the author is upset because the fianc\u00e9 is now saying she wants to wait until after marriage to have sex again, citing religious guilt and her friends' choices.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The engagement period was supposed to be a time of anticipation, but the fianc\u00e9's sudden change in sexual desire is causing conflict. The author is upset because they didn't agree to wait until marriage when they started dating. Now, with the wedding approaching, the fianc\u00e9 is feeling guilty and wants to delay intimacy. The author is resentful because their expectations were different.\n\nI should think about mutual respect and communication. The author tried to respect the fianc\u00e9's initial reasons (body issues) but felt ignored when the problem persisted. When the real reason came out\u2014religious guilt and wanting to wait\u2014the author is conflicted. They didn't agree to this term when they started the relationship, so the sudden shift is causing tension. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, wanting to have sex is a natural part of a relationship, especially if that's what both parties expected. However, if the fianc\u00e9 is making a valid personal choice now, even if it's a late change, the author might feel wronged. But the fianc\u00e9's reasons are personal and rooted in her background. However, the key issue is that this decision was made after the engagement, which the author didn't agree to. \n\nBut maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they had a prior understanding. The fianc\u00e9's change in stance is causing a conflict that wasn't discussed before the engagement. The author's resentment is justified if they felt misled about future expectations. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 is now making a choice based on her values, which she didn't disclose earlier. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author is not in the wrong because they had a different expectation, and the fianc\u00e9's change in decision is causing unforeseen issues. The answer is B.\n"
