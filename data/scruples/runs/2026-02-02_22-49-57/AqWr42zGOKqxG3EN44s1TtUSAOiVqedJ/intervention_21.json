  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for wanting to have sex with my fiance?\nMy fiance and I have been engaged for a year and are getting married in a few months. Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong in their situation with their fianc\u00e9e. The author is upset because their fianc\u00e9e's sex drive has dropped significantly after they got engaged. The fianc\u00e9e cites body image issues at first, but later reveals she had guilt about not losing her virginity the way she wanted and now wants to wait until after marriage. The author is frustrated because they didn't agree to wait until marriage, and they're feeling resentful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The engagement changed things. Both partners didn't choose to wait until marriage initially, but the fianc\u00e9e is now feeling the need to do so due to her Catholic background and friends. The author is upset because their expectations didn't align with the fianc\u00e9e's new stance. \n\nThe main issue here is about mutual expectations in a relationship. When they started dating, neither saw marriage as a prerequisite for sex. But after engagement, the fianc\u00e9e's perspective changed. The author is hurt because this wasn't discussed beforehand. The fianc\u00e9e might feel conflicted between her beliefs and the author's expectations. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author is expressing their feelings of being upset and resentful. They tried to respect her initial reasons but are now confronting her after learning the real issue. The fianc\u00e9e's change in stance is causing tension. The author isn't forcing the issue; they're expressing their frustration. \n\nIt's important to note that both parties have valid points. The author feels their needs aren't being met, while the fianc\u00e9e is struggling with guilt and changing values. The author's resentment might be valid if they feel their expectations were unmet. However, the fianc\u00e9e's feelings and background are also significant. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, relationships require communication and compromise. The author isn't at fault for feeling upset about a change in their partner's behavior, especially if it wasn't discussed before engagement. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to change her stance after the engagement might have been a mistake in communication. So, the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
