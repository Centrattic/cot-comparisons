Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about their fianc\u00e9e's sudden decrease in sex drive after engagement.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author is upset because their fianc\u00e9e's sex drive dropped significantly after they got engaged. Initially, the fianc\u00e9e blamed body issues like weight gain and psoriasis, but later revealed she's waiting until marriage to have sex again. She comes from a religious background and feels guilty as the wedding approaches. The author is frustrated because they didn't agree to wait until marriage when they started dating, and now the dynamic has changed, leading to resentment.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the key points. The author and fianc\u00e9e didn't set that expectation of waiting until marriage when they started dating. They were already having sex before engagement. The fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after engagement, possibly due to personal or religious reasons. The author feels it's unfair because they didn't sign up for that. However, the fianc\u00e9e has her reasons, and the author had to confront her about it after the change.\n\nIs the author wrong for being upset? Well, communication is key in relationships. The author tried to respect her initial reasons but after the change, it's a new issue. The author isn't wrong to feel frustrated if the expectations were not discussed upfront. But also, the fianc\u00e9e has a right to change her mind, especially regarding personal values. The problem here is a miscommunication. The author might not be in the wrong for being upset, but they should address it through open dialogue. The fianc\u00e9e might be making a personal choice, but it's important that both partners are on the same page. The author's resentment is valid if the expectations were not aligned. But maybe the author should have had more communication earlier. However, the fianc\u00e9e did eventually explain her reasons, so the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling this way. The answer is probably B (No), the author isn't in the wrong, but the situation requires mutual understanding and discussion.\n"
