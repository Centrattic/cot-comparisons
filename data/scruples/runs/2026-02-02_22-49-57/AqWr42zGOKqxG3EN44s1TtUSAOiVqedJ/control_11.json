Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is engaged and upset because their fianc\u00e9e's interest in sex dropped after they got engaged. They were having sex three times a week before engagement, but now it's like twice a year. The fianc\u00e9e initially blamed body image issues but later admitted it's about wanting to wait until marriage. She comes from a Catholic background and feels guilty now that the wedding is near. The author is frustrated because they didn't agree to wait until marriage when they started dating. They're starting to resent her for changing their dynamic.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. \n\nOn one hand, the author is upset because their expectations of a regular sex life were unmet. They had a certain understanding when they were dating, and now the fianc\u00e9e is changing the terms. The author feels it's unfair because they didn't agree to abstinence until marriage. Also, the sudden drop in intimacy might be affecting their relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e has valid reasons rooted in her upbringing and personal beliefs. She's dealing with Catholic guilt and trying to align with her values now that the wedding is close. She's also mentioned body image issues, which are real and can affect libido. The author respected her initial reasons, so maybe they shouldn't be blamed for not pushing harder before she came clean. However, the fact that she changed her mind after engagement might be a point of contention. Did the author know this was a possibility when they got engaged? If they both didn't choose to wait initially, maybe the author now feels betrayed because she's enforcing it post-engagement.\n\nIs the author wrong for resenting this change? Well, if the fianc\u00e9e's reasons are genuine and she's trying to honor her beliefs, the author might need to adjust. But if the author didn't agree to this boundary and feels it's affecting their relationship, they might have a right to be upset. The key is communication. The author tried to respect her reasons at first but now feels it's a significant issue. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's sudden change might not be the author's fault, but the author's reaction (resentment) is understandable. However, expecting the fianc\u00e9e to change her stance just because the author is upset could be unfair. The author might need to find a middle ground, but if they don't agree with waiting, they might be in the right to feel conflicted. \n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, maybe not. They're expressing their feelings about a change in the relationship dynamic. However, they could be part of the problem if they're unwilling to compromise or if their resentment is causing more harm. The answer depends on whether the author is respecting the fianc\u00e9e's boundaries while also addressing their own needs. Since the fianc\u00e9e has valid reasons and the author didn't agree to wait from the start, the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but there's a mutual responsibility here. The question is if the author is the asshole. If the author is pushing for sex despite her reasons, that could be problematic. But since they're upset because their needs aren't met, maybe they're not wrong. The answer might be B (No), but I'm a bit conflicted. However, considering the fianc\u00e9e's personal beliefs and the author's frustration without coercion, it's a complex situation where both could have valid points, but the author's resentment might not make them the asshole.\n"
