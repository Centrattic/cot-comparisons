Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation. The author is engaged, and their fianc\u00e9e's sex drive has dropped significantly after the engagement. They discovered that she now wants to wait until after marriage to have sex again, citing her Catholic background and the fact that she didn't lose her virginity the way she wanted to. The author is upset because they didn't agree to this arrangement beforehand and are starting to resent her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after being engaged, which might not have been discussed before the engagement. The author feels misled or disappointed because they didn't sign up for waiting until marriage. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e has her reasons rooted in her background and feelings of guilt. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual expectations. If they didn't set this boundary before the engagement, the fianc\u00e9e might be shifting the dynamics without prior agreement. The author's frustration is valid if they expected a certain level of sexual activity based on their previous relationship. However, the fianc\u00e9e's decision to wait could be a personal choice influenced by her values and emotional state. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the fianc\u00e9e changed her mind without discussing it thoroughly beforehand, the author's resentment is understandable. The author isn't necessarily at fault here because they didn't agree to the new terms. However, the situation could also be a matter of differing expectations that need to be resolved through communication. Since the question is about whether the author is the asshole, the answer might hinge on whether the fianc\u00e9e's change in stance was communicated properly and if the author is respecting her boundaries now. \n\nGiven that the author is upset about a change that wasn't discussed before the engagement, and they're experiencing resentment, it's a complex situation. But since the fianc\u00e9e is now acting on her own choice, even if late, the author's feelings are valid. The answer would likely be B (No), meaning the author isn't in the wrong. However, it's important to note that both parties need to communicate better to find a solution that works for both.\n"
