Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation with their fianc\u00e9e. The author is upset because their fianc\u00e9e's sex drive dropped after they got engaged. She mentioned body image issues at first, but then later admitted she's holding off because she wanted to wait until marriage, influenced by her Catholic upbringing and friends. The author is frustrated because they didn't agree to that arrangement beforehand and are now resentful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is in a committed engagement, expecting a certain level of intimacy. The fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after engagement, which the author didn't consent to. The key here might be communication. When they got engaged, did they discuss their expectations about sex? If not, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault for being upset. However, the fianc\u00e9e did try to explain her reasons, including personal guilt and religious influence. She might have a right to her feelings, especially if she's dealing with internal conflict. But the author's surprise and resentment suggest that the fianc\u00e9e didn't communicate this boundary clearly before the engagement. \n\nAlso, the fact that the fianc\u00e9e didn't mention this until after the engagement could be an issue. The author might feel that a major decision like changing the sexual arrangement wasn't discussed upfront. However, the fianc\u00e9e's reasons might be valid for her, and the author needs to respect her boundaries if that's the case. The problem is whether the author is in the wrong for being upset. If they both entered the engagement without clear communication about this aspect, maybe both share some responsibility. But the question is specifically about the author. The author didn't agree to wait until marriage, so their frustration is understandable. However, the fianc\u00e9e's decision is her own, and the author might need to adjust or discuss it further. \n\nIn terms of cultural context, some people might see the author as reasonable for expecting their needs to be met, while others might see the fianc\u00e9e's religious convictions as a valid reason. The answer might hinge on whether the author is respecting her decision despite their own feelings. But the author is asking if they're in the wrong. If the fianc\u00e9e's reasons are legitimate and she's communicated them, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for being upset, but they might need to find a compromise. The question is whether the author is the asshole, so the answer might be B (No), because the author's frustration is valid given the change in expectations without prior agreement. However, if the author is pressuring her against her wishes, then maybe they are in the wrong. The story doesn't mention coercion, just that the author is upset and developing resentment. So maybe the answer is B because the author isn't in the wrong for feeling this way, but there's room for discussion.\n"
