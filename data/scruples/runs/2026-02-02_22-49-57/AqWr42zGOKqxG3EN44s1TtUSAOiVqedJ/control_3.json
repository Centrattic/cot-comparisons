Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 whose sex drive dropped after engagement, and the author is upset because their fianc\u00e9e decided to wait until marriage for sex, even though they hadn't agreed to that beforehand.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author mentions they had a good sex life before engagement but it's way down now. The fianc\u00e9e attributes it to body issues and later admits she wants to wait until marriage. She comes from a Catholic background, which might influence her feelings of guilt. The author is upset because this was a sudden change and they feel resentment. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the fianc\u00e9e made a choice that affects their relationship. The author didn't agree to a waiting period before marriage, so the change in dynamics is unexpected. The author has a right to feel upset if their needs aren't being met, but it's also about communication. They did talk about it, and the fianc\u00e9e explained her reasons. However, the author might be in the wrong if they're not considering her feelings and religious background. But the key point is that the decision to wait was unilaterally made by the fianc\u00e9e after the engagement, which wasn't part of their prior agreement. The author is expressing frustration over a change in the relationship terms without prior consent. \n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e is dealing with personal issues and her beliefs. If the author is pressuring her, that could be a problem, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's resentment stems from unmet expectations, but if they didn't agree to wait, it's reasonable to feel upset. However, the author should also be empathetic. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because the fianc\u00e9e changed the terms of their relationship without prior agreement. The author's feelings are valid given the circumstances. But I need to check if there's a nuance I'm missing, like if the author is being unreasonable about the fianc\u00e9e's decision. But since the change happened after engagement and wasn't discussed before, the author's reaction is understandable. So the answer is B.\n"
