Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's fianc\u00e9e suddenly losing interest in sex after they got engaged, citing religious guilt and wanting to wait until marriage. The author is upset because he didn't agree to that arrangement when they started dating, and now feels resentful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple had a good sex life before engagement but it dropped significantly afterward. The fianc\u00e9e explains it's due to body issues, then later reveals she feels guilty about not losing her virginity as she wanted and now wants to wait until marriage. The author feels they didn't agree to this when they started dating, so the change in their dynamic is causing resentment.\n\nI should think about the concept of consent and mutual agreement in relationships. When they started dating, neither of them agreed to wait until marriage. Now, the fianc\u00e9e is changing her stance post-engagement. The author's feelings of being upset and resentful are valid because there was a shift in expectations that wasn't discussed beforehand. However, the fianc\u00e9e's decision might stem from personal values and guilt, which are her own reasons. \n\nFrom a relationship ethics perspective, both partners should have ongoing communication about their needs and boundaries. If the fianc\u00e9e is now making a choice that affects their intimacy, the author is justified in feeling that their needs aren't being met. But at the same time, respecting her personal values is important unless they cause harm. \n\nHowever, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If he's expressing his feelings of being upset and resentment due to a lack of prior agreement, it's reasonable. He's not forcing her to have sex; he's upset because the dynamic has changed without mutual discussion. On the other hand, if he's pressuring her or being disrespectful, that's different. The original post doesn't mention coercion. \n\nIn many AITA scenarios, the \"asshole\" is someone who acts unreasonably or without empathy. The author here is expressing his feelings and explaining the situation, so unless he's being dismissive or aggressive in his response, he's not the asshole. The fianc\u00e9e's change in behavior is causing the issue, but the author's reaction to that is within his rights. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong. He's expressing his feelings about a situation that was not agreed upon, which is a common and valid reaction. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
