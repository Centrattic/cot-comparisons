Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for wanting to have sex with their fianc\u00e9e after her sex drive decreased post-engagement. The situation involves a change in their relationship dynamic due to her religious upbringing and personal feelings of guilt about not waiting until marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple was already having a good sex life before engagement but now it's significantly less. The fianc\u00e9e initially attributed it to body image issues but later revealed that she's feeling guilty about not waiting until marriage, which wasn't a prior agreement. The author is upset and beginning to resent her for this change.\n\nIn terms of social norms, some people might argue that the author should respect her choice, especially if it's rooted in her values. However, others might say that since there was no prior agreement to wait until marriage, it's reasonable for the author to feel frustrated. The key points here are communication, mutual respect, and the initial terms of the relationship. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's decision seems to be a personal one, influenced by her background and feelings. The author is not pressuring her before the wedding, but the sudden shift post-engagement is causing tension. It's important to note that both partners have the right to their sexual preferences, but they also need to find a compromise that works for both. \n\nThe author's reaction is understandable as long-standing relationship dynamics changing can lead to feelings of resentment. However, whether they're \"in the wrong\" depends on whether they're respecting her boundaries and the reasons behind her decision. The author hasn't forced her into anything, just expressed their feelings, which is part of healthy communication. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might lean towards B (No), because the author is expressing their feelings and it's part of a mutual conflict where neither is entirely at fault. The fianc\u00e9e's change in behavior is her personal choice, and the author's frustration is valid if it wasn't discussed earlier. But there's also a need for them to talk and find a solution together. The question is about being in the wrong, and since both have different perspectives, the author isn't necessarily wrong for feeling upset. They need to address it through discussion, not necessarily blame.\n"
