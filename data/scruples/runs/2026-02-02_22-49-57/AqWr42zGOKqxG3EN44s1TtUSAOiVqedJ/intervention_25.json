Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The scenario is about a fianc\u00e9 whose sex drive has dropped after they got engaged, and now she wants to wait until after marriage to have sex. The author is upset about this change and feels some resentment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author and his fianc\u00e9e had a good sex life before engagement, but after engagement, it plummeted. The fianc\u00e9e gave reasons like body image issues and then later mentioned religious guilt about waiting until marriage. The author feels they never agreed to wait until marriage, so he's upset about the sudden change.\n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. When they started dating, neither chose to wait until marriage, so the author didn't expect that. The fianc\u00e9e's change in stance after engagement could be a new boundary she's setting. However, the author is now dealing with the consequences of that boundary, which affects their relationship dynamic.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, it's about mutual respect. The author respected her initial reasons but now feels the change is affecting him negatively. The fianc\u00e9e's decision might be valid for her personal beliefs, but the author has a right to feel upset if this change wasn't discussed or agreed upon. However, it's also important that the author approached her about it and tried to understand her reasons.\n\nOn one hand, the author isn't in the wrong for feeling upset if the change wasn't discussed upfront. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e's decision to wait is her personal choice, influenced by her religious background. The author might need to adjust his expectations, but resentment could indicate a deeper issue if communication continues to be lacking.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't the asshole for being upset, but maybe he should focus on open communication rather than resentment. The fianc\u00e9e's change in stance could be valid, but the author's feelings are also legitimate. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, considering they didn't agree to wait until marriage and are now dealing with the consequences, the answer might lean towards \"B\" (not in the wrong). However, if the author is not respecting her new boundaries, then maybe \"A\". But the story says he respected her initial reasons and confronted her later, which shows he tried to communicate. So, the author's frustration is understandable, and he's not necessarily in the wrong.\n"
