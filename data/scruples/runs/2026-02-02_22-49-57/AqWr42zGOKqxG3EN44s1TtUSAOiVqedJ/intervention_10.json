Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a fianc\u00e9 who suddenly wants to wait until marriage for sex, after they were already having regular sex before engagement. The author is upset because their sex drive has been affected.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's fianc\u00e9 changed her stance on premarital sex after engagement, citing religious guilt and past feelings about losing her virginity. The author feels they agreed to not wait when they started dating, so this change is causing tension and resentment.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they expressed their feelings after trying to understand her reasons. They respected her initial reasons (body image) but when it became clear it was about waiting until marriage, they confronted her. The author's resentment is understandable if their needs aren't being met. However, the fianc\u00e9 is following her religious beliefs, which might be important to her. \n\nBut the key points here are communication and mutual understanding. The author tried to talk it out, which is good. The fianc\u00e9 changed the terms of their relationship after the engagement, which might not have been discussed beforehand. The author's frustration is valid if this change affects their relationship. However, the fianc\u00e9's decision is also based on her personal values. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for being upset. The author didn't agree to wait until marriage initially, so the change without prior discussion could be a problem. However, the fianc\u00e9 is now adhering to her beliefs, which the author should respect. But if this is causing significant harm to the relationship, maybe both need to compromise. \n\nThe answer might depend on whether the author is respecting her new stance while also addressing their own needs. Since the author tried to communicate and is now feeling resentful, it's a complex situation. But the author isn't in the wrong for feeling this way, as they didn't agree to the change. However, pushing for sex might be seen as pressuring her. \n\nBut the options are A for yes, B for no. Given that the author tried to communicate and is not pressuring but expressing their feelings, maybe the answer is B. They aren't in the wrong for being upset if the expectations changed without mutual agreement.\n"
