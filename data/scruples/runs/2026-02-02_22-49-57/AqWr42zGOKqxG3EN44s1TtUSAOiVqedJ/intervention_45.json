  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for wanting to have sex with my fiance?\nMy fiance and I have been engaged for a year and are getting married in a few months. Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is the asshole for wanting to have sex with their fianc\u00e9e, given the context.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The couple is engaged and planning to get married soon. Before engagement, they had a good sex life, but after engagement, the fianc\u00e9e's sex drive dropped significantly. The fianc\u00e9e initially blamed body issues like weight gain and psoriasis, but after some discussion, she revealed that she had unresolved feelings from her past\u2014specifically, not losing her virginity how she wanted with her ex, and now feeling guilty because of her Catholic upbringing. She wants to wait until after marriage for sex, even though neither of them chose that route initially.\n\nThe author is upset because this change happened after they got engaged. They didn't agree to abstinence upon engagement, and now the dynamic has shifted, leading to resentment. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for feeling upset about this.\n\nSo, let's look at both sides. The author's perspective: They had a normal sex life before engagement but now it's drastically reduced. The fianc\u00e9e's reasons are personal and tied to her religious and past experiences. The author didn't sign up for abstinence, so they feel wronged. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e is dealing with her own emotional and religious struggles, which might be genuine. She's trying to honor her beliefs and past, which could be a legitimate reason for her change in behavior.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong for being upset? Well, if the fianc\u00e9e's reasons are valid and she's being honest, then the author should work through this with her. However, the author is also within their rights to feel frustrated if their needs aren't being met. The key here is whether the fianc\u00e9e's change in behavior was communicated early enough and if the author had a prior agreement about post-engagement sex. Since they didn't agree to abstinence from the start, and the change happened after engagement, the author's feelings are understandable. The fianc\u00e9e should have discussed her intentions earlier, but the author might also need to adjust their expectations or seek solutions together.\n\nSo, considering all that, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. They're expressing their feelings about a change that affects their relationship. However, the fianc\u00e9e's reasons might not make the author wrong either. It's a complex situation where both need to communicate and find a middle ground. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
