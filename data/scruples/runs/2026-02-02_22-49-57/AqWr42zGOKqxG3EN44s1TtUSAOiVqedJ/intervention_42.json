Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is \"in the wrong\" for being upset that their fianc\u00e9e wants to wait until marriage for sex, which is a change from when they were engaged. The fianc\u00e9e cites religious guilt and body image issues as reasons for the sudden change.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The couple had a regular sex life before engagement, and after engagement, the fianc\u00e9e's sex drive dropped. The author confronted her and found out she's having feelings of guilt due to her Catholic background and wants to wait until marriage. The author is upset because they didn't agree to this beforehand and now feel resentment.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for being upset. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong.\n\nI should think about consent and communication. The fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after engagement, which wasn't part of their original agreement. The author is upset because this change affects their expectations. However, people can change their minds, especially regarding personal values. The author didn't force the engagement; they had the choice to accept her terms. But the sudden shift without prior discussion could be valid for the author to be upset. \n\nReligious upbringing and personal ethics play a role. The fianc\u00e9e's background might influence her decision, but if she didn't communicate this earlier, it could be a problem. The author's resentment might stem from unmet expectations, but if the fianc\u00e9e made a choice based on her beliefs, the author has to decide whether to support her or not. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for feeling upset because the situation changed without prior agreement. However, the fianc\u00e9e's decision is also her right. The core issue is communication and mutual expectations. The author's feelings are valid, but the fianc\u00e9e's choice is her own. So the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
