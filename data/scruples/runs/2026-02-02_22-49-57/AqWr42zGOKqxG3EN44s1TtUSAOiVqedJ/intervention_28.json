Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a fianc\u00e9 who is upset that his fianc\u00e9e has become less interested in sex after they got engaged. She mentions Catholic upbringing and wanting to wait until marriage, which wasn't part of their original agreement. The author feels resentful because the change came after the engagement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author has valid feelings here. They were expecting a similar level of intimacy as before, but it dropped significantly. The fianc\u00e9e's reasons are rooted in her religious beliefs, which she's now choosing to follow more strictly post-engagement. The key point is that the decision to wait until marriage wasn't agreed upon when they started dating. The author is upset because the dynamic shifted without prior discussion.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e has her own reasons\u2014body image, religious guilt, and wanting to align with her values. She might be struggling with these feelings, which are personal and influenced by her background. However, the change in behavior after the engagement might have caught the author off guard, leading to his resentment.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. The author's frustration is understandable because expectations were not met. However, the fianc\u00e9e's decision is a matter of personal belief. Neither is entirely wrong, but the author's reaction is based on unmet expectations. Since the change wasn't discussed before the engagement, it's a valid point of conflict. However, the author's resentment might indicate a lack of consideration for her personal journey. But the main issue is the shift in their agreement, so the author isn't necessarily wrong for being upset. The answer probably leans towards B, the author isn't in the wrong, but it's a nuanced situation.\n"
