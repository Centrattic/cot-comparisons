  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for wanting to have sex with my fiance?\nMy fiance and I have been engaged for a year and are getting married in a few months. Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 whose sex drive dropped after engagement, leading to conflict. The author is upset because the fianc\u00e9 is now waiting until after marriage to have sex, which wasn't part of their original agreement. They both had different past experiences and the fianc\u00e9 comes from a religious background contributing to her feelings of guilt.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is frustrated because their partner's sudden decision to wait until marriage is affecting their relationship. They had a good sex life before engagement, so the change is significant. The fianc\u00e9's reasons include religious upbringing and body image issues. She didn't mention this before engagement, which might be a problem.\n\nThe key points are: the fianc\u00e9 changed her stance after engagement, the author didn't expect this, and they're both upset. The author respects waiting until marriage in general but feels it wasn't their agreement. The fianc\u00e9's reasons are valid, but the change in the engagement period caused tension.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they're expressing their frustration about a change in expectations after the engagement. They didn't know about this issue before committing, which might be a factor. However, the fianc\u00e9 has her reasons, and the author is now resentful. But the question is about being in the wrong. The author's feelings are valid because they didn't agree to this change. But maybe they should have discussed it earlier?\n\nWait, the fianc\u00e9 did bring up body issues first, and the author respected that. Then later, after some prying, she revealed the real reason. The author confronted her, and she explained. The author is upset because the decision to wait until marriage came after engagement, which wasn't part of their initial understanding. The author is justified in feeling upset as their expectations weren't met. The fianc\u00e9's reasons are personal but might not take into account the author's needs. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're reacting to a change that wasn't discussed upfront. The answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They have valid concerns about the shift in their relationship's dynamic after engagement.\n"
