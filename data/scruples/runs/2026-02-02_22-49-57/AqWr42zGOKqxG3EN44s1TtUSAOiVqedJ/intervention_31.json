Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted this is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9's sudden change in sexual desire after engagement.\n\nFirst, the couple had a good sex life before engagement. After engagement, the fianc\u00e9e's sex drive dropped. She initially blamed body issues but later admitted she's feeling guilty due to her Catholic upbringing and wants to wait until marriage. The author is upset because they didn't agree to wait until marriage when they started dating, and now they're getting married soon, leading to resentment.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual expectations. The author tried to respect her reasons initially but felt blindsided when she changed her stance. The fianc\u00e9e's Catholic background plays a role, but the author didn't agree to waiting until marriage. \n\nIn relationships, it's important that both partners are on the same page regarding major life decisions, like when to have sex. If one partner introduces a new expectation after the relationship has progressed (like after engagement), it can create tension if the other isn't prepared for it. The author is expressing frustration because this change hasn't been addressed and is affecting their relationship negatively. \n\nHowever, the fianc\u00e9e's reasons are personal and rooted in her values. It's possible she's struggling with her own conflicting feelings. The author's resentment is understandable if they feel their needs aren't being met, especially after agreeing to a timeline (engagement) that implied continuing their previous sexual relationship. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? They tried to respect her reasons, but the sudden drop without prior agreement could be a breach of mutual understanding. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e's personal ethics might be a legitimate reason for her change. The problem here might be a lack of communication when she decided to change her stance. \n\nSince the author didn't agree to wait until marriage initially, the fianc\u00e9e's decision to change the dynamic without prior discussion could be problematic. The author's feelings of resentment are valid in this context. So, the author isn't in the wrong for being upset. The fianc\u00e9e's actions might be the issue here, but the question is about the author's wrongness. The answer is likely B.\n"
