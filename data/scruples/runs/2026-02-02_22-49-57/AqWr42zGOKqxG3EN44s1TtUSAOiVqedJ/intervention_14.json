Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to have sex with their fianc\u00e9e after she changed her stance on premarital sex post-engagement.\n\nFirst, both the author and the fianc\u00e9e have had sex before marriage. The fianc\u00e9e's shift in attitude happened after they got engaged, which is when the issue really started. The author respected her initial reasons but is now upset because the frequency of their sexual activity dropped significantly. The fianc\u00e9e mentioned religious upbringing and guilt about the wedding, which are personal reasons. \n\nThe author argues that they didn't agree to wait until marriage initially, and the change in her stance is causing tension. From a fairness perspective, if the fianc\u00e9e changed her mind after the engagement, that could be a problem. But the author also needs to consider her feelings and reasons, which include body image and religious guilt. \n\nHowever, the key point is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they both entered the engagement with the understanding that they had both been sexually active before, the fianc\u00e9e's sudden change without prior discussion might be the issue. The author expressing their feelings of being upset and developing resentment is a valid reaction if they feel their needs are being unmet without prior agreement. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of respecting her reasons. If the author is pressuring her to have sex against her will, that would be wrong. However, the question is about the author's feelings and their right to be upset, not about forcing her. The author is not in the wrong for feeling this way, as long as they are communicating and respecting her boundaries while expressing their own needs. The main conflict here is a mismatch in expectations after the engagement, which is a common issue in relationships. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong for being upset, as they are expressing their legitimate feelings and the fianc\u00e9e changed her stance without prior agreement.\n"
