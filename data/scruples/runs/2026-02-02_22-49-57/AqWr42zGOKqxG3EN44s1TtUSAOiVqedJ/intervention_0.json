  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for wanting to have sex with my fiance?\nMy fiance and I have been engaged for a year and are getting married in a few months. Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's fianc\u00e9e changing her stance on having sex after they got engaged. Initially, their sex life was good, but after the engagement, it plummeted. The fianc\u00e9e cites body image issues, but later reveals she didn't lose her virginity how she wanted and wants to wait until after marriage. The author is upset because this is a new development post-engagement and feels a dynamic shift leading to resentment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is frustrated because the change in sexual frequency is affecting their relationship. The fianc\u00e9e has personal reasons rooted in her religious background and personal experiences. The key question is whether the author is wrong for being upset about this.\n\nFrom the author's side, it's reasonable to feel upset if the relationship dynamics have changed significantly, especially since they didn't agree to abstinence after engagement. The fianc\u00e9e's change in behavior came later, not during their initial commitment. The author respected her initial reasons (body issues) but felt betrayed when the real reason was a shift in stance about premarital sex. They had agreed not to take that route, so her change of heart might feel like a breach of their mutual understanding.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e's Catholic background and personal experiences with losing her virginity could be genuine factors. She might be struggling with guilt as the wedding approaches. However, the author is not in the wrong for being upset because they entered the engagement with expectations based on their past relationship. The sudden change without prior discussion could lead to resentment, even if the fianc\u00e9e's reasons are valid.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is the asshole. Since the author is expressing frustration over a significant change in their agreed-upon relationship terms, and the fianc\u00e9e didn't communicate her intentions earlier, the author's feelings are justified. The answer would likely be B (No), as the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
