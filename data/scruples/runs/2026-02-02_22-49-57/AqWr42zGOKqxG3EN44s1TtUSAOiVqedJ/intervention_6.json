Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 whose sex drive has dropped significantly after engagement, and the author is upset about it. The fianc\u00e9 cites body image issues and a desire to wait until marriage due to her Catholic background. The author is frustrated because they didn't agree to wait until marriage when they started dating, and now the dynamic has changed, leading to resentment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple was already sexually active before engagement, and the fianc\u00e9 decided to wait until marriage after the engagement. The author is upset because this change in the fianc\u00e9's stance affected their relationship. The author's resentment is growing because the fianc\u00e9's new decision isn't what they originally agreed upon.\n\nI should think about communication here. The fianc\u00e9 came forward with her reasons after being confronted, which is good. However, the author feels blindsided because this wasn't discussed earlier. The author might feel that their needs aren't being considered now that the fianc\u00e9 has changed her mind. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 has valid personal and religious reasons for her decision, which she's now acting on.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they respected her initial reasons (body issues) but are now upset because the fianc\u00e9 changed her stance. The author might be in a tough spot because their expectations were based on their previous relationship dynamic. However, the fianc\u00e9's decision is her own, especially influenced by her background. The author's resentment might stem from unmet expectations, but does that make them the asshole?\n\nI think the key here is that both partners have different needs and values. The author didn't agree to wait until marriage, so the change in the fianc\u00e9's behavior affects them. However, the fianc\u00e9 is also acting on her beliefs. The author could be in the right if they communicated their feelings and tried to find a compromise. But if they're just resentful without addressing it constructively, maybe they share some blame. However, the situation is complex, and both might have valid points. But based on the information given, the author's frustration is understandable, and the fianc\u00e9's change in stance was a surprise. The answer is likely B (not wrong), but I need to check if there's anything else.\n"
