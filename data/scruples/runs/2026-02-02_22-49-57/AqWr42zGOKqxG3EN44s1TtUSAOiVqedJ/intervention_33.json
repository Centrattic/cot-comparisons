Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 whose sex drive dropped after engagement, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they used to have a good sex life, three times a week, but after engagement, it's down to twice in a year. The fianc\u00e9e initially blamed body image issues but later admitted she wanted to wait until marriage. She has a Catholic background and feels guilty now that the wedding is approaching. The author feels upset and resents the change in dynamics.\n\nNow, considering the options. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nThe key points here are about expectations and communication. When they started dating, neither chose to wait until marriage. So, the author didn't expect to wait, and neither did she. Now, after engagement, she's changing her stance, which affects their relationship. The author feels this is unfair because it's a recent development. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's reasons are personal\u2014religious guilt and friends' influence. The author is upset because their expectations have shifted, leading to resentment. However, the author initially respected her body image concerns and gave her space. The issue arises when the fianc\u00e9e's stance changes post-engagement, which wasn't discussed before. \n\nIn relationships, communication is crucial. If the fianc\u00e9e decided to wait after engagement, maybe she should have discussed it earlier. The author's feelings of resentment are valid because the dynamic changed without prior agreement. But the author also didn't push the issue initially, showing consideration. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? They're upset because the fianc\u00e9e's decision is affecting their sex life and trust. However, the fianc\u00e9e's choice to wait now might be her personal growth, even if it's late. The author's resentment is understandable, but it's a complex situation. \n\nLooking at the options, AITA is often about fairness and communication. The author might not be in the wrong because they communicated their feelings and tried to understand. The fianc\u00e9e's change in stance is the main issue here. So, the answer would lean towards the author not being in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
