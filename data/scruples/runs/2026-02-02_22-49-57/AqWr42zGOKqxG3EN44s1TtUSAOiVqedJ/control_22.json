Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to have sex with their fianc\u00e9e, given the context provided.\n\nFirst, the couple is engaged and planning to get married. Before engagement, they had a regular sex life, but after engagement, the fianc\u00e9e's sex drive dropped. She initially attributed it to body issues, but later revealed she's waiting until marriage to have sex, influenced by her Catholic upbringing and friends. The author is upset because they didn't agree to this change until after engagement and now feel resentful.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual expectations. The fianc\u00e9e didn't mention her desire to wait until marriage until after the engagement, which was a significant change from their previous understanding. The author is now feeling upset because their expectations were different. \n\nIn relationships, it's important for both partners to have open and honest communication about their needs and boundaries. The fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after the engagement, which wasn't discussed beforehand. The author's frustration is understandable because they made compromises (like respecting body image issues) without knowing the real reason. However, the author also didn't address the issue immediately when the sex drive dropped, which might have contributed to the current tension.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the fianc\u00e9e changed her position after the engagement without prior discussion, and the author is now struggling with this change, it's a matter of mutual respect and communication. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting sex, but the situation highlights a breakdown in communication from both sides. However, the question specifically asks if the author is in the wrong, and given that the fianc\u00e9e changed her stance post-engagement without prior agreement, the author's feelings are valid. Therefore, the answer might be B (No) because the author isn't in the wrong for being upset about a change that wasn't mutually agreed upon.\n"
