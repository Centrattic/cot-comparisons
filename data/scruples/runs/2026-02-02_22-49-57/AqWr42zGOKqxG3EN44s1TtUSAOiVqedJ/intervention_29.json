Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about their fianc\u00e9e's sudden decrease in sexual interest after engagement, which the fianc\u00e9e attributes to her Catholic upbringing and wanting to wait until marriage. The author is upset because they didn't agree to this beforehand, leading to resentment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple had a good sex life before engagement. After engagement, the fianc\u00e9e's sex drive dropped significantly. She initially blamed body image issues but later revealed she's feeling guilty due to her religion and wanting to wait until marriage. The author didn't agree to waiting when they started dating, so the change in dynamic is causing conflict.\n\nNow, thinking about relationship expectations. When they started dating, neither chose to wait until marriage. The fianc\u00e9e's change in stance came after engagement. In a healthy relationship, both partners should communicate their needs and boundaries. The author felt respected when she first mentioned body issues but now feels blindsided by the religious reasons. \n\nThe author's resentment is understandable because there was a lack of communication about this important issue before the engagement. Both partners should have discussed their views on sex and marriage expectations earlier. However, the fianc\u00e9e's reasons (religious guilt) are personal and valid, even if the author didn't anticipate this. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? They're upset because the agreement changed after engagement. But since they didn't set this boundary earlier, maybe they should have discussed it more. However, the fianc\u00e9e's sudden change without prior communication could be the main issue. The author's feelings are valid, but so is the fianc\u00e9e's need to reconcile her beliefs. \n\nI think it's a mutual issue. The author didn't agree to wait, but the fianc\u00e9e's reasons are personal. Neither is entirely wrong. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author didn't agree to this shift and it's causing conflict, maybe the answer is B (No), but it's a bit nuanced. The author isn't wrong for feeling upset, but both need to communicate better. However, the main issue is the fianc\u00e9e changing the terms post-engagement without prior discussion. So the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
