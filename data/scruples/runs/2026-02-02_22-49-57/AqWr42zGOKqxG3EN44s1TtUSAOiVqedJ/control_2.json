Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in their situation.\n\nSo the scenario is that the author is engaged and wants to have sex with their fianc\u00e9e. Before engagement, they had a good sex life, but after getting engaged, it dropped. The fianc\u00e9e initially blamed body image issues but later admitted she's waiting until marriage because of her Catholic upbringing and friends who waited. The author is upset because they didn't agree to wait until marriage when they started dating, only after engagement. The author feels resentful now that the dynamic has changed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations. When they started dating, neither of them chose to wait until marriage. They had sex before engagement. Now, after engagement, she's changing her stance. The author feels blindsided because this wasn't part of their initial agreement. The fianc\u00e9e's reasons are about personal guilt and her background, but the timing of her change is after the engagement. \n\nIs the author wrong for being upset? Well, the author's frustration is understandable. If they had mutual expectations before engagement, a sudden shift post-engagement could create conflict. However, the fianc\u00e9e is making a choice based on her values, which she's now clarifying. The author might feel that this change isn't fair, especially since they didn't agree to it beforehand. \n\nBut does that make the author the asshole? Or is the fianc\u00e9e overstepping by changing terms after engagement? The key here is communication. They had conversations about her body issues, but she didn't disclose her religious feelings until later. The author tried to respect her reasons initially. Now, the author is upset because the dynamic has changed, and they're resentful. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, relationships require compromise. If the fianc\u00e9e is now choosing to wait, even if it wasn't part of the original agreement, it's her personal choice. But the author has the right to express their feelings about the change. However, the author's resentment could be justified if they feel misled. Did she not communicate her true reasons earlier? If she only revealed the religious aspect after the engagement, that might be a problem. But if she genuinely only realized later, then it's a matter of mutual adjustment.\n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for being upset. They had expectations based on their past relationship. The fianc\u00e9e's change in stance post-engagement is causing conflict, and the author is valid in feeling that their needs aren't being met. However, the answer depends on whether the fianc\u00e9e was truthful from the start. Since she admitted it was a sudden realization, maybe the author isn't the asshole here. The answer might be B (No), as the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for being upset about a change in circumstances that wasn't agreed upon beforehand.\n"
