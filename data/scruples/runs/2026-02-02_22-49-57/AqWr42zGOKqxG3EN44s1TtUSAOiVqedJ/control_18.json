Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 whose sex drive has decreased after engagement, and the author is upset about it. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the details. They were engaged for a year, originally had a good sex life, but after engagement, it dropped. The fianc\u00e9 initially blamed body issues but later revealed she wants to wait until marriage because of her Catholic background and guilt, even though both didn't take that route initially.\n\nThe author is upset that the dynamic has changed, leading to resentment. They question if they're the asshole for feeling this way. \n\nNow, the key elements here are consent, communication, and mutual agreements. When they started dating, neither chose to wait until marriage. The fianc\u00e9 changed her stance after engagement, which the author didn't expect. The author respects waiting but feels it wasn't part of their original agreement. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the fianc\u00e9's decision to change her views post-engagement is her choice, but it's affecting the relationship. The author is expressing their feelings of being upset and resentful, which is valid. However, they need to consider if there's mutual agreement now. The author might be in a tough spot because they didn't sign up for this change. But is it their fault? They tried to respect her initial reasons, confronted her when necessary, and are now voicing their feelings. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9's actions might be causing the problem, but the author's reaction is about their own feelings. It's a complex situation where both parties need to communicate. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling upset, especially since the expectation wasn't there from the start. However, the answer depends on whether their resentment is justified. Since they\u2019re both adults and she changed her stance, the author isn't the asshole for being upset. So the answer is B (No).\n"
