Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The author is engaged and upset because their fianc\u00e9e's sex drive dropped after the engagement. They say that before engagement, they had a good sex life, but after, it's gone down significantly. The author confronted her, and she mentioned feeling guilty about losing her virginity to her previous boyfriend and now wanting to wait until marriage. Their friends also waited, and she comes from a Catholic background.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author and fianc\u00e9e didn't agree on waiting until marriage initially; they both had sex with others. The fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after engagement, which led to the author feeling upset and resentful. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nLooking at the situation, the author respected her initial reasons (body image issues) and gave her space. Later, the fianc\u00e9e revealed deeper reasons tied to her religious background and social influences. The author feels they didn't sign up for this change, leading to resentment. \n\nI should think about communication and expectations. When couples engage, they might have discussions about their sexual expectations. However, if the fianc\u00e9e changed her mind post-engagement, the author is justified in feeling confused or upset, especially if this wasn't discussed beforehand. The author isn't wrong for having needs and expectations either. \n\nBut also, the fianc\u00e9e's reasons are personal and tied to her values. The author might need to adjust or find a compromise. However, the question is about the author being in the wrong. Since the fianc\u00e9e's change in stance is a personal decision influenced by her background, the author isn't necessarily wrong for being upset. They didn't agree to wait from the start, so her change might catch them off guard. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is mutual respect and communication. The author communicated their feelings when the situation changed, and the fianc\u00e9e shared her reasons. The author's reaction is valid given the change in circumstances. Therefore, the answer is B (author isn't in the wrong).\n"
