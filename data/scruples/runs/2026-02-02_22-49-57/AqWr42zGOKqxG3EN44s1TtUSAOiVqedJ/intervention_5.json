Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the fianc\u00e9's sex drive dropped after they got engaged, and she later explained she wants to wait until marriage because of her Catholic background and guilt. The author feels upset and is developing resentment because they didn't agree to that beforehand.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is engaged, so they expected a certain level of intimacy. The fianc\u00e9 changed her stance after the engagement, which wasn't discussed earlier. The author might feel betrayed or like their needs are being neglected. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9 has her reasons rooted in religion and personal comfort. She might be struggling with her beliefs and wants to honor them now that the wedding is near.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual understanding. Did the fianc\u00e9 communicate her feelings earlier? She mentioned body issues first, then later the religious reasons. The author respected her initial reasons but now feels blindsided. The author is upset because the dynamic changed without prior discussion, leading to a significant decrease in intimacy. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they're upset because their expectations weren't met. They didn't agree to wait until marriage, so the sudden change might be a problem. However, the fianc\u00e9 has her own valid reasons. It's about whether the author is justified in feeling resentful. If the fianc\u00e9 didn't communicate her intentions before the engagement, that's an issue. But the author also has a right to express their needs and discuss this openly. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for being upset. Since the fianc\u00e9 changed her approach after the engagement without prior agreement, the author isn't wrong to feel this way. The problem here is more about communication breakdown and differing expectations. The author isn't in the wrong because they're expressing their feelings and seeking resolution. The answer would likely be B (not in the wrong).\n"
