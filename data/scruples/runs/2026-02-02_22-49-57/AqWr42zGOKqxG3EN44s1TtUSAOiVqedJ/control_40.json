Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 whose partner's sex drive dropped after engagement, and the partner now wants to wait until marriage because of Catholic guilt and friends' influence. The author is upset because they didn't sign up for that when they started dating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's fianc\u00e9 changed her stance after engagement. They had a good sex life before, and now it's almost nonexistent. The author feels wronged because the decision to wait was made after the engagement, not during their initial dating. The fianc\u00e9 mentions body image issues, but the real reason came out later. The author is upset and developing resentment.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's reasons are personal\u2014religious background, friends' choices, and feeling guilty as the wedding approaches. She might be struggling with her own feelings and societal expectations. The author respected her initial reasons but now feels blindsided by the deeper religious motivations.\n\nKey points: Communication was attempted, but the change only happened post-engagement. The author didn't agree to this condition upfront. The fianc\u00e9's reasons are valid for her, but the timing and lack of prior discussion might be an issue. The author's resentment is understandable given the circumstances. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether the author should accept this sudden change without prior discussion. Since the fianc\u00e9 decided this after engagement, and the author didn't agree to it initially, it's more about the fianc\u00e9's change in stance rather than the author being wrong. However, the author's feelings of being wronged could also be valid if they expected a certain level of consistency. But the main issue is the fianc\u00e9's decision post-engagement, so the author might not be in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
