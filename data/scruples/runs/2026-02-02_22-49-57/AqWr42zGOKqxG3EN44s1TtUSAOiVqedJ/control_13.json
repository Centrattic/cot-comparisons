Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 who wants to have sex, but after engagement, the partner's sex drive dropped significantly. The fianc\u00e9 found out that the partner is now choosing to wait until after marriage due to Catholic upbringing and feelings of guilt. The author is upset and feels resentful because they didn't agree to wait until marriage when they started dating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is feeling wronged because the expectations changed after engagement. They had a good sex life before engagement, and now it's less frequent. The fianc\u00e9 has a valid reason rooted in her religious beliefs and personal feelings. She's struggling with guilt because her current partner is not the one she wanted to lose her virginity to. \n\nThe author's main issue is the sudden shift in their relationship dynamic. They didn't agree to wait until marriage when they started dating, so the change after engagement is a problem. However, the fianc\u00e9 has her own reasons, which might be valid and important to her. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they're upset because their expectations weren't met. But the fianc\u00e9's reasons are personal and tied to her beliefs. The author respects her body issues at first but later confronts her. It's a communication issue. Both parties have valid points. The author might not be in the wrong for feeling upset, but they might also be missing the depth of the fianc\u00e9's feelings. The key is whether the author is unreasonable in their expectations or if they should have addressed this before engagement. Since the change happened after engagement, the author's frustration is understandable, but the fianc\u00e9's reasons are also significant. So, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but there's a need for mutual understanding. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they didn't agree to wait until marriage, the fianc\u00e9's decision after engagement changes things. The author is upset because of the change in their agreed-upon terms. So, maybe the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. But wait, the fianc\u00e9 did communicate her reasons, so maybe the author should try to understand. But the author is allowed to feel upset. Hmm. It's a bit of a toss-up. The key is whether the author is unreasonable. If the fianc\u00e9's reasons are legitimate and she communicated them, the author might be in the right to express their feelings but not necessarily in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
