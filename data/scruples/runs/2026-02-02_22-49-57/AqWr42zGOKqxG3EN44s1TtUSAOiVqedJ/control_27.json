Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is the asshole in their situation. The author is engaged to be married in a few months, and after getting engaged, their fianc\u00e9e's sex drive dropped. They had good sex three times a week before, but now it's maybe twice in a year. The fianc\u00e9e attributes it to body image issues and psoriasis, but later admits she's feeling guilty because of her Catholic upbringing and wants to wait until after marriage. The author is upset and feels resentful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is in a committed engagement, but they didn't agree to wait until after marriage. They had an active sex life before engagement. The fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after the engagement, possibly due to religious guilt. The author is now upset because their expectations weren't met, leading to resentment. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they respected her initial reasons but then felt ignored when she changed her mind. The fianc\u00e9e didn't communicate this change earlier. The author's resentment is understandable if they feel it's a sudden shift without prior discussion. However, the fianc\u00e9e's feelings and beliefs are valid. But the key point is whether the author is wrong for being upset. They didn't agree to wait after marriage, so the change in her behavior affects their relationship. The author's frustration is about unmet expectations and lack of communication. \n\nBut maybe the fianc\u00e9e didn't make it clear that she wanted to wait until after marriage. If the author didn't know this was coming, then their reaction is justified. On the other hand, the author might have expected her to communicate this earlier. However, the fianc\u00e9e's reasons are personal and valid. The author is not in the wrong for being upset, as they had no prior agreement. So the answer would be B.\n"
