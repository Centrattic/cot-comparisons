Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole for being upset that their fianc\u00e9e wants to wait until after marriage for sex. They had a good sex life before engagement but it dropped off after. The fianc\u00e9e mentioned body issues at first, then later revealed she's religious and wants to wait, even though they both didn't take that route before. The user is upset because they didn't agree to that when they started dating, and now their dynamic is changing.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. The author didn't agree to waiting until marriage, so their expectations were different. The fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after engagement, which the author didn't anticipate. The author is feeling resentful, which is a valid emotion when expectations shift. However, the fianc\u00e9e has her own reasons, including religious beliefs and personal guilt. \n\nIs it fair for the author to be upset? They have a right to be, since their needs and the agreed-upon relationship terms changed. But the fianc\u00e9e's decision might be based on her values. The key point is that both should have discussed expectations before engagement. Since they didn't, the sudden shift is causing conflict. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling upset because they didn't consent to the change. The fianc\u00e9e's actions are her choice, but it's a problem if it wasn't discussed upfront. So, answer B.\n"
