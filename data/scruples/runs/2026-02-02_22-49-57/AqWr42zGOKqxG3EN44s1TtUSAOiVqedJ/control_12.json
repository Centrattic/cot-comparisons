Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 whose sex drive dropped after engagement because of religious guilt and wanting to wait until marriage. The author is upset and feels resentment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author didn't agree to waiting until marriage when they started dating. The fianc\u00e9 changed her mind later, which affects their relationship. The author has a right to feel upset if their expectations were different. But maybe the fianc\u00e9 is dealing with personal issues and her Catholic background is influencing her now.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is being honest about their feelings. They tried to respect her initial reasons but are now addressing the real issue. It's important that they're having these conversations, but they might need to find a compromise. However, the fianc\u00e9's change in stance after the engagement could be a problem. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for being upset, especially if their needs aren't being met. But maybe there's a middle ground they can find. The key here is communication and mutual respect. Since both have different expectations now, they need to work it out together. The author isn't the asshole if they're trying to address the issue, but maybe they need to approach it with more empathy. However, the fianc\u00e9's sudden change might be the main issue here.\n"
