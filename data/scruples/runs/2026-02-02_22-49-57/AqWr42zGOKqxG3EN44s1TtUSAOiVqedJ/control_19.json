Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The question is whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple engaged to be married, where the fianc\u00e9e's sex drive dropped significantly after the engagement. The author is upset because their fianc\u00e9e now wants to wait until after marriage to be intimate, even though they didn't choose that path when they started dating. The fianc\u00e9e's reasons include religious upbringing and guilt as the wedding approaches. The author feels resentful and is asking if they're the asshole for being upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The couple has been together for a while, had a good sex life before engagement, and now there's a significant change. The fianc\u00e9e's shift in perspective comes after engagement, which is when the author feels the dynamic changed. The key points are consent, communication, and mutual expectations.\n\nThe author isn't in the wrong if they didn't agree to waiting until marriage initially. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to change her stance might be personal or influenced by her background, but the author has the right to feel that their needs aren't being met if they didn't agree to this change. However, the author should also consider the reasons behind the fianc\u00e9e's decision, like her religious upbringing and the fact that she's feeling guilty. It's a matter of mutual respect and communication. If both partners hadn't discussed this expectation beforehand, the sudden change could lead to conflict. The author's resentment is valid if they didn't consent to this change, but it's also important for them to work through it together. The answer likely leans towards the author not being in the wrong (B), because the fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after the engagement without prior agreement, and the author's feelings are understandable if they didn't sign up for that.\n"
