Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author is engaged to their fianc\u00e9e, and they've noticed a significant drop in their sexual activity since getting engaged. The fianc\u00e9e initially blamed body issues like weight gain and psoriasis, but after some discussion, it came out that she felt guilty about losing her virginity to their current partner before marriage. She comes from a deeply religious Catholic background and now, as the wedding approaches, she's decided she wants to wait until after marriage to have sex again. The author is upset because they didn't agree to this arrangement when they started dating, and they're starting to resent her for changing the dynamic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author and fianc\u00e9e were already in a sexual relationship when they started dating and got engaged. The change in the fianc\u00e9e's stance happened after the engagement, not beforehand. The author feels they didn't sign up for waiting until marriage, which suggests that there was no prior agreement about this. The fianc\u00e9e's reluctance is tied to her religious beliefs and guilt, which might be a valid personal conflict for her. However, the author is now dealing with the consequences of this change, leading to resentment.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author mentions that they had conversations about the decrease in sexual activity, and the fianc\u00e9e initially attributed it to other factors. The author respected her reasons, but the fianc\u00e9e later revealed the real reason. The author feels wronged because the change in her stance came after the engagement, altering their relationship dynamic.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From an ethical standpoint, both partners should have discussed and agreed on their expectations regarding sex and intimacy before committing to marriage. However, the fianc\u00e9e's decision to wait until after marriage wasn't made at the beginning of their relationship. The author had no prior knowledge or agreement about this, so they're not at fault for expecting the previous level of intimacy. The fianc\u00e9e's change in stance, while based on her personal beliefs, affects the relationship without the author's consent. The author's resentment is a valid emotional response given the circumstances.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e's feelings of guilt and the influence of her religious background might be genuine. However, it's the timing of her decision that's problematic. If she had discussed this earlier, they could have addressed it together. Since she changed her stance after the engagement, the author's frustration is understandable. Neither party is entirely in the wrong, but the question is about the author's fault. Since the author didn't agree to wait until marriage and the fianc\u00e9e changed her stance without prior discussion, the author isn't in the wrong for feeling upset. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
