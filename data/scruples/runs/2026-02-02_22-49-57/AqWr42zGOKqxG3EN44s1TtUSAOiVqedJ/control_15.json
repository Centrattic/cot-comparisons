Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole for wanting to have sex with their fianc\u00e9e, who has significantly reduced their sexual activity since engagement. The fianc\u00e9e cites body issues and a desire to wait until after marriage due to religious upbringing and past regrets about losing virginity. The author is upset because they didn't agree to this arrangement when they started dating and now feel resentful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple was already engaged, so they made a commitment to each other. The fianc\u00e9e's change in behavior comes after the engagement, which the author didn't consent to. The author's frustration is understandable because their expectations were different. However, the fianc\u00e9e's reasons involve personal values and emotional healing, which are valid. The key here is whether the author's expectations were communicated and if both parties are respecting each other's boundaries. Since the author didn't agree to wait until after marriage, but the fianc\u00e9e is making that choice now, it's a conflict of expectations. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to continue their previous sexual relationship, but they also need to communicate their feelings and work with their fianc\u00e9e. However, the question is if the author is the asshole. The answer might hinge on whether the author is being unreasonable or not considering their partner's feelings. But since the fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after the engagement without prior agreement, the author's resentment is a reaction to unmet expectations. So, the answer is B (No), as the author isn't in the wrong, but the situation requires mutual discussion.\n"
