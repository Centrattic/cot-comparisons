Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're the asshole for wanting to have sex with their fianc\u00e9e, but she's not interested anymore after they got engaged. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, they were engaged for a year, with a wedding coming up. Their sex life was good before the engagement but dropped significantly after. The fianc\u00e9e mentioned body image issues at first, like weight gain and psoriasis. The author respected that but eventually confronted her. She then revealed she didn't lose her virginity the way she wanted and now wants to wait until after marriage, influenced by her Catholic background and friends. The author is upset because they didn't agree to that before the engagement, and now they're resentful.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. The author is in a committed relationship and is expressing their needs and feelings. It's reasonable to expect communication about such a significant change. However, the fianc\u00e9e has her own reasons, including personal and religious beliefs, which are valid. The author didn't agree to abstinence before marriage initially, so the sudden change might be a problem. But is the author wrong for feeling upset? They're supposed to respect each other's boundaries. If the fianc\u00e9e is clear about her stance, the author might need to find a solution, like counseling, rather than just resenting her. However, the author is also within their rights to express their dissatisfaction. The key here is whether the author is being unreasonable in expecting the relationship to continue as before. Since the fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after the engagement, the author isn't necessarily wrong to be upset, but they might need to address it through communication rather than resentment. So, the answer might be B (No), because the author isn't in the wrong for feeling this way, but they should work on resolving it with their partner.\n"
