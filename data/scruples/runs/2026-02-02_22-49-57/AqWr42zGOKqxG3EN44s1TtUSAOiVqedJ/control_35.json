Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for being upset that their fianc\u00e9e wants to wait until marriage for sex. \n\nFirst, let's break down the situation. The couple has been engaged for a year, with a wedding approaching. Initially, their sex life was good, but after engagement, the fianc\u00e9e's sex drive dropped. She attributed it to body image issues, but later revealed her Catholic background and a desire to wait until marriage. The author is upset because they didn't agree to celibacy when they started dating, only after engagement. They feel resentful now that the dynamic has changed.\n\nNow, the key points here: Did the author agree to wait until marriage? The question states that neither of them chose to wait when they started dating. The change happened after engagement. The fianc\u00e9e's reasons are personal\u2014religious guilt and wanting to align with friends who waited. The author feels wronged because their expectations weren't met.\n\nBut wait, expectations in relationships can vary. When they got engaged, maybe communication about sexual expectations wasn't clear. The fianc\u00e9e changed her stance based on her values, which is her right. The author didn't sign up for celibacy, but they also didn't discuss this before the engagement. Could they have set boundaries earlier? Maybe. But the fianc\u00e9e's decision is valid for her, even if it causes conflict.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? They're upset about unmet expectations, but maybe they should have communicated their needs better during engagement. However, the fianc\u00e9e's reasons are personal and religious. The author's resentment is understandable, but does that make them the asshole? It's a tough call. \n\nThe answer might hinge on whether the author respected her reasons and tried to find a middle ground. The question says they had conversations, but if the author is now resentful because the terms changed after engagement, perhaps they're not in the wrong entirely. However, maybe they should have addressed this during engagement planning. \n\nBut the fianc\u00e9e made a change post-engagement without prior agreement, which is her choice, but it affects the relationship. The author's frustration is valid, but the fianc\u00e9e's decision is also her autonomy. Neither is entirely in the wrong. However, the question is about the author's actions. If they're upset about not having agreed to this change, maybe they're not the asshole. So, answer B (No).\n"
