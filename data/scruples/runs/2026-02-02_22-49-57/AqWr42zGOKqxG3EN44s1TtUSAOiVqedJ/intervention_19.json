Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The author is engaged and is upset because his fianc\u00e9e's sex drive has dropped after they got engaged. She mentioned she wants to wait until after marriage to have sex again, which is a shift from their previous agreement. The author is wondering if he's the asshole for being upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author didn't agree to wait until marriage when they started dating, so this sudden change might be causing him distress. He's feeling resentful because their dynamic has changed. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e has her reasons rooted in her Catholic upbringing and personal feelings about her past. She's dealing with body image issues and guilt as their wedding approaches.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author says they've had conversations, and she initially attributed the change to body issues. He respected that but now feels it's different. She later revealed her religious reasons. The author respects waiting until marriage in general but didn't agree to it when they started. Now, he's upset because the expectation has changed.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's expressing his feelings and explaining his perspective. He tried to understand her reasons and was patient. However, he's feeling resentful because the terms of their relationship have shifted without prior agreement. The fianc\u00e9e's change in stance might be causing tension, but the author isn't necessarily wrong for feeling upset. It's about whether expecting mutual understanding and compromise is fair.\n\nIn relationships, both parties need to communicate their needs and boundaries. If one's expectations change significantly after a commitment like engagement, it's important to address it. The author isn't in the wrong for being upset because his needs aren't being met, but he also needs to consider her perspective. The question is whether his reaction is valid. Since he's not pressuring her and is trying to understand, it's more about differing expectations than being an asshole. So, the answer is likely B.\n"
