Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So, the question is whether the author of this story is in the wrong. The situation is that they're engaged, and after getting engaged, their fianc\u00e9e's sex drive dropped a lot. She attributes it to body image issues and some religious guilt about not waiting until marriage. The author is upset because they didn't agree to wait until marriage when they started dating, and now they're starting to resent her for changing their dynamic.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The couple has been engaged for a year and is getting married soon. Before engagement, their sex life was good, three times a week. After engagement, it's dropped significantly. The fianc\u00e9e initially blamed body issues but later revealed she wanted to wait until after marriage because of her Catholic background and friends' influence. The author feels upset because they didn't agree to that arrangement when they started dating. They're frustrated that the dynamic changed after engagement and now have resentment.\n\nSo, the main conflict is about expectations and communication. The author didn't agree to wait until marriage, and the fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after they got engaged. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being upset about this. \n\nI think the key here is that both partners have different expectations. The author is entitled to feel upset if there was a change in their agreed-upon relationship dynamics without prior discussion. However, the fianc\u00e9e's reasons are personal and rooted in her religious background, which is valid. But the problem is that she changed her approach after the engagement, which the author didn't agree to initially. \n\nIn relationships, communication is crucial. If the fianc\u00e9e had discussed this earlier, maybe during the engagement period when they were planning the wedding, it could have been addressed. Instead, the change happened after they were already engaged, leading to the author's frustration. The author's resentment is understandable if they feel that a significant aspect of their relationship is being altered without mutual agreement now.\n\nOn the other hand, the fianc\u00e9e's feelings of guilt and wanting to wait might be genuine, but she should have communicated this earlier. The author is not in the wrong for being upset because their expectations weren't met, and the change wasn't mutually agreed upon. However, it's also important for the author to consider the fianc\u00e9e's feelings and the reasons behind her decision. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author is wrong. Since the author didn't agree to wait until marriage initially, and the fianc\u00e9e changed her stance later without prior discussion, the author's frustration is valid. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong (B). They have a right to feel upset about the change in their relationship's dynamic and the lack of prior agreement on this significant aspect.\n"
