Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The author is engaged and upset because their fianc\u00e9e's sex drive dropped significantly after the engagement. They had a good sex life before, but now it's way less frequent. The fianc\u00e9e initially blamed body image issues, but later admitted she wants to wait until marriage to have sex again. She's influenced by her Catholic background and friends who waited. The author feels they didn't agree to this arrangement when they started dating and now they're resentful.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are communication, expectations, and mutual consent. When they started dating, neither expected to wait until marriage. The fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after engagement, which caused a shift in their relationship dynamic. The author is upset because their expectations weren't met. \n\nIn relationships, both partners should have open and honest communication about their needs and boundaries. The fianc\u00e9e's change in behavior without prior discussion might lead to misunderstandings. However, the author also needs to consider their fianc\u00e9e's feelings and reasons. The fianc\u00e9e's religious background and personal guilt might be genuine factors. But the author's frustration is valid if this sudden change wasn't discussed earlier. \n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't wrong for feeling upset, especially if there was no prior agreement to wait until marriage. However, the fianc\u00e9e's reasons are personal and might require empathy from the author. The real issue is the lack of communication and mutual understanding. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but both might need to address this more openly. The answer would be B (No), as the author isn't in the wrong for being upset, but both partners need to work on communication.\n"
