Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong in this situation. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 whose sex drive dropped after they got engaged. The author is upset because their fianc\u00e9 now wants to wait until after marriage for sex, which wasn't part of their original agreement when they started dating. The fianc\u00e9 explains it's due to Catholic upbringing and guilt as the wedding approaches.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are consent, communication, and mutual agreements in a relationship. When they started dating, neither wanted to wait until marriage. They had a good sex life before engagement but after becoming engaged, the fianc\u00e9's desire changed. The author feels wronged because they didn't agree to wait until marriage, and now they're ressenting the change. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the fianc\u00e9 changed their stance after the engagement. The author might not be in the wrong if they were clear about their expectations from the start. But if the fianc\u00e9 is now choosing to change her mind, maybe she should have communicated that earlier. However, the author is upset because their needs aren't being met now. But the fianc\u00e9 has her reasons based on her background. \n\nBut wait, the author respected her initial reasons (body issues) but then discovered it was about waiting until marriage. The author might not be in the wrong because they didn't agree to that condition. However, relationships require compromise. The author might be justified in feeling upset since expectations have shifted. On the other hand, the fianc\u00e9's feelings and beliefs are valid too. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is being unreasonable. If the fianc\u00e9 only changed her mind after engagement, maybe she should have been honest earlier. The author's frustration is valid because they didn't agree to this change. So, maybe the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the fianc\u00e9 changed her mind without prior agreement, leading to the author's justified feelings.\n"
