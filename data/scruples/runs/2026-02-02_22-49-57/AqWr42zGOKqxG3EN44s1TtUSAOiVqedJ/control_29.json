Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The scenario is about a fianc\u00e9 whose sex drive has decreased after engagement, and the author is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The couple was engaged a year ago and getting married soon. Their sex life was good before engagement but dropped significantly afterward. The fianc\u00e9e initially blamed body image issues but later admitted to feeling guilty about not waiting until marriage due to her Catholic background. The author is upset because they didn't agree to wait until marriage when they started dating. Now they're resentful because the dynamic has changed.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for feeling upset. Let's break it down. The author didn't agree to a premarital sex ban when they started the relationship. Now, after engagement, the fianc\u00e9e is changing the terms. The author's resentment comes from unmet expectations. But is that the author's fault?\n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to expect consistency in the relationship's terms. If the fianc\u00e9e decided to change the agreement after engagement, that could be a problem. However, the fianc\u00e9e's reasons are personal and rooted in her values and background. The author respected her initial concerns about body image, which is good communication. But when the fianc\u00e9e later admitted to a change in her stance, the author felt blindsided.\n\nIs the author wrong for resenting this? Maybe not entirely. Relationships require mutual discussion about expectations. If the fianc\u00e9e didn't communicate her desire to wait until marriage before engagement, the author might feel it's a late change. However, the author could also be at fault for not having these conversations earlier or for not addressing the issue more proactively when the sex drive dropped. \n\nBut the fianc\u00e9e's decision to change her stance after engagement is a significant shift. The author didn't agree to that, so their frustration is understandable. However, the author should consider that people's values can change, especially under pressure like an impending marriage. The key here is whether the author is respecting the fianc\u00e9e's current wishes despite their own feelings. If they're resentful but trying to work through it, maybe they're not the asshole. If they're pressuring or being disrespectful, then maybe they are.\n\nIn the post, the author says they confronted the fianc\u00e9e and tried to understand. They didn't push back on her reasons but are now resentful. The question is about being in the wrong. Since the fianc\u00e9e changed her stance without prior agreement, the author isn't entirely wrong for being upset. However, they might need to address this through open communication and find a middle ground. But the initial question is if the author is in the wrong. Considering the circumstances, the answer might be B (No), because the author's feelings are valid given the unagreed change. However, the author's resentment could also be seen as unreasonable if they didn't communicate their needs earlier. But the fianc\u00e9e's decision came after engagement, so the author isn't wrong for feeling this way. So I think the answer is B.\n"
