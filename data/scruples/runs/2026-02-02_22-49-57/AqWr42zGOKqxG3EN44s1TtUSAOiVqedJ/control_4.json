Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 who feels upset because his fianc\u00e9e's sex drive has dropped after they got engaged. She initially blamed body image issues but later revealed she's holding off because she wants to wait until marriage, influenced by her Catholic background and friends. The author is upset and feels some resentment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple was already having sex before engagement, so the change happened post-engagement. The fianc\u00e9e's shift in attitude is due to personal and religious reasons, which she communicated after some discussion. The author didn't know about this motivation until later. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author's perspective is that he didn't agree to waiting until marriage when they started dating, which makes the sudden change difficult. He's feeling wronged and resentful. But from her side, she's making a conscious choice based on her values, even if it conflicts with his expectations.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The fianc\u00e9e did eventually explain her reasons, so maybe the author's resentment comes from not anticipating this shift. However, he also respected her initial reasons before discovering the deeper issue. The fact that she's making a change now might be tough for him, especially if he had different expectations. \n\nBut is he in the wrong? If he didn't agree to waiting until marriage, and she's now choosing that path, maybe the issue is about mutual expectations. However, since they're getting married, perhaps she's adjusting her behavior based on her beliefs. The author's resentment might stem from unmet needs post-engagement. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's expectations were communicated or if he should have been more understanding of her religious values. Since they didn't discuss this before engagement, maybe he's not entirely wrong to feel upset. However, expecting her to not change her stance based on her beliefs might be unfair. \n\nBut the question is about being in the wrong. If the author is respecting her decision now, even if it's causing tension, maybe he's not in the wrong. Alternatively, if he's pressuring her to change her stance, he might be. The post says he's upset and resentful but doesn't specify if he's pressuring her. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's expressing his feelings about the situation, which is valid. But it's also a matter of differing values. The fianc\u00e9e's choice is her right, but the author's feelings are real too. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for feeling upset, as long as he's trying to communicate. However, if he's being disrespectful about her decision, that's different. Since the post shows he's trying to understand but is still hurt, maybe he's not in the wrong.\n"
