Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is the asshole (AITA) in the situation described. Let me break down the details.\n\nSo, the author is engaged and wants to have sex, but their fianc\u00e9e's sex drive has dropped significantly after engagement. They had good sex three times a week before engagement, now twice in a year. The fianc\u00e9e blames body image issues and a religious background, but later admits she wants to wait until after marriage. She has Catholic friends who did that. The author didn't agree to waiting when they started dating, only after engagement. Now the author feels upset and resentful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is frustrated because the fianc\u00e9e changed her stance on premarital sex after they became engaged. They didn't discuss this expectation clearly before engagement. The fianc\u00e9e is feeling guilty due to her background and friends' influences. She might have developed these feelings later. The author feels wronged because they didn't agree to wait, leading to resentment. \n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's reasons are based on personal guilt and religious beliefs, which are significant. But she didn't communicate this earlier. She waited until after engagement to bring it up, changing the dynamics. The author might feel that this was a hidden condition, leading to a lack of mutual agreement. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, wanting to have sex is normal, especially if it was part of the relationship before. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to wait now could be a valid personal choice, but the author didn't consent to this change. However, the author also didn't push for communication earlier. Maybe both could have discussed expectations more openly. The key point is whether the author is unreasonable in feeling upset. If the fianc\u00e9e changed her stance without prior agreement, the author's frustration is understandable. But the author could also be at fault for not addressing the issue sooner. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, it's about mutual responsibility. The author's resentment is valid if the fianc\u00e9e changed terms after engagement. However, the author might not be in the wrong because they didn't agree to the change. So, answer B (not in the wrong) makes sense here. The fianc\u00e9e's actions led to the conflict, but the author's feelings are justified. However, maybe the author should have communicated better earlier. Hmm. But given the situation, the author is more in the right because they didn't agree to the new condition. So B.\n"
