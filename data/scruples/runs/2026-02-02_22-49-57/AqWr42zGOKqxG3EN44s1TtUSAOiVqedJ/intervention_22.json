  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for wanting to have sex with my fiance?\nMy fiance and I have been engaged for a year and are getting married in a few months. Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this query. The user is asking if the author of the described situation is in the wrong. The setup is that the fianc\u00e9's sex drive dropped after engagement, and now he's upset she wants to wait until marriage. The author claims they didn't agree to wait and that this change came after engagement, leading to resentment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is frustrated because their sexual needs aren't being met, and the fianc\u00e9's reasons are based on religious upbringing and personal guilt. The key points are:\n\n1. **Communication**: They've had discussions about the change in sex drive. The fianc\u00e9 initially cited body image issues but later admitted it's about waiting until marriage. The author confronted her, which led to the truth. Communication is a big part here. Did the author press the issue appropriately, or was it prying? The fianc\u00e9 did eventually open up, so maybe the author's approach was valid to understand the root cause.\n\n2. **Expectations and Agreements**: When they started dating, neither intended to wait until marriage. The fianc\u00e9's change in stance post-engagement could disrupt their original understanding. The author isn't in the wrong for expecting consistency unless there was a mutual agreement to adjust. However, relationships can evolve, and maybe the fianc\u00e9 felt differently once engaged.\n\n3. **Respect for Boundaries**: The author respects her reasons but is now resentful. It's important to balance mutual respect with personal feelings. The author might be in the right to feel upset if this change wasn't discussed earlier, but they also need to consider her feelings and background.\n\n4. **Cultural and Religious Influences**: The fianc\u00e9's Catholic background plays a role. Her sudden guilt might not be something the author can control. However, the author should have been aware of this aspect if it's a significant part of her identity.\n\n5. **Impact on Relationship**: The resentment is growing. Both need to address this to reconcile expectations. The author's frustration is understandable, but the fianc\u00e9's decision to change her stance post-engagement complicates things. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling hurt, but they might need to work on finding a solution together.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't entirely in the wrong. They communicated and tried to understand but are justified in feeling upset over unmet expectations. However, the fianc\u00e9's reasons are valid from her perspective. The main issue is the lack of prior agreement on this change. So, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
