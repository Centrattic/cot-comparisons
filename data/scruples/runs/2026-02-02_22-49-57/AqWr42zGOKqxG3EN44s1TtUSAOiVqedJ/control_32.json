Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong (AITA). The scenario involves a fianc\u00e9 whose sex drive dropped after engagement, leading to conflict. The fianc\u00e9 gives reasons like body image issues and a religious background, but later admits it's about waiting until marriage. The author feels upset and resentful because they didn't agree to wait until marriage when they started dating, only after engagement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is frustrated because their fianc\u00e9 changed her stance on sex after engagement, leading to a significant decrease in intimacy. The fianc\u00e9's reasons are personal\u2014body image, religious upbringing, and wanting to wait. The author didn't agree to this arrangement initially, so they feel wronged.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The fianc\u00e9 did talk about body issues first, then later revealed her religious reasons. The author tried to respect her initial reasons but was upset when the real issue was about waiting until marriage. The author is now resentful because the dynamic changed after the engagement.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they didn't agree to wait until marriage initially. The fianc\u00e9 changed her stance after the engagement, which is after they committed to marriage. The author has a right to feel upset if their expectations were different. However, maybe the author could have addressed this earlier. But since the fianc\u00e9 didn't disclose her reasons until after the engagement, the author might not be in the wrong for feeling resentful. The key point is that the fianc\u00e9's change in stance occurred after the engagement, which the author didn't consent to. So the answer is likely B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
