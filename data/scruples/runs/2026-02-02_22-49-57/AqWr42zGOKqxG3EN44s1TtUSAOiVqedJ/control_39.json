Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that their fianc\u00e9e's sex drive dropped significantly after they got engaged, and she now wants to wait until marriage despite not having done so before.\n\nFirst, the key points: They were engaged a year ago, had a good sex life before engagement, now it's much less. The fianc\u00e9e mentions body image issues and a religious background leading to guilt. The author feels upset and resentful because they didn't agree to wait until marriage initially, and now the dynamic has changed.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong. From the description, the author respected the fianc\u00e9e's concerns initially and didn't push. When the fianc\u00e9e changed her stance, the author is upset because the expectation wasn't there before. The fianc\u00e9e changed her perspective after the engagement, which the author didn't agree to, leading to resentment.\n\nThe author's feelings are valid because consent and mutual agreement are important in relationships. The fianc\u00e9e's change in stance post-engagement could be a significant shift without prior discussion. However, the author's reaction (resentment) might be seen as a problem if they didn't communicate their needs or if they're not considering her reasons. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for feeling upset. The author is not in the wrong for being upset if the terms of the relationship changed without mutual agreement. The fianc\u00e9e changed her mind about premarital sex after they got engaged, which wasn't part of the original understanding. The author's frustration stems from unmet expectations and a lack of prior discussion. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
