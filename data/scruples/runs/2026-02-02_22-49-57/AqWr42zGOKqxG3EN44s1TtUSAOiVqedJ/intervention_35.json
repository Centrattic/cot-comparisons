Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for being upset that their fianc\u00e9e wants to wait until marriage, even though they didn't agree to that initially.\n\nFirst, the key points: They had a good sex life before engagement, but after engagement, the fianc\u00e9e's libido dropped. She mentioned body issues first, but later revealed she wants to wait until after marriage due to her Catholic upbringing and feelings of guilt. The author is upset because they hadn't planned to wait and are now resentful.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author's fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after engagement, which wasn't part of their initial agreement. The author feels betrayed or surprised by this change. However, the fianc\u00e9e has her reasons rooted in her upbringing and personal beliefs. She's not being dishonest but is struggling with her values as the wedding approaches.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong to be upset. The author's resentment comes from unmet expectations. They had an established pattern of intimacy that changed, and they're frustrated. But the fianc\u00e9e is also dealing with her own emotional and cultural conflicts. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't in the wrong for feeling upset. It's reasonable to expect communication and agreement on such a significant change. However, the fianc\u00e9e's reasons might be valid, but she should have addressed this earlier. The author's resentment is a reaction to a shift in the relationship's dynamic without prior discussion. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (not in the wrong) because the author's feelings are understandable given the circumstances. The fianc\u00e9e's change in stance, while personal, affects the relationship, and the author has a right to express their feelings.\n"
