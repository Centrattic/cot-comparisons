Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation is that they and their fianc\u00e9e had a good sex life before engagement, but after getting engaged, her sex drive dropped. They tried to talk about it, and she mentioned body issues at first, but later revealed that she's holding off because she wants to wait until after marriage, influenced by her religious background and friends. The author is upset, feels resentment, and is questioning if they're the asshole for that.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The engagement is a year old with a wedding soon. The change in sexual frequency is significant, from three times a week to twice in a year. The fianc\u00e9e initially gave reasons about her body, then later about wanting to wait post-marriage. The author is now resentful because they didn't agree to this when they started dating. \n\nSo, the main issue here is the sudden change in the relationship dynamic after engagement. The author didn't sign up for celibacy after engagement, and the fianc\u00e9e didn't mention this preference earlier. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong for being upset. \n\nI should consider if there's any fault on the author's side. Did they pressure the fianc\u00e9e before engagement? The post says they had a good sex life before engagement, so maybe not. The problem arises after the engagement, which was a mutual decision. The fianc\u00e9e's change in behavior is unexpected and not discussed upfront. The author is respecting her reasons but is now resentful because the expectation wasn't set when they committed to the engagement. \n\nAnother angle: The fianc\u00e9e's religious background and the influence of friends might be a legitimate reason for her. However, if this decision was made after the engagement, it's a significant change in their relationship. The author might feel like they're entering the marriage with a different understanding. But is it the author's fault for not accepting this change? \n\nAlso, the author confronted her after prying, which suggests they tried to understand her perspective. The fianc\u00e9e admitted to guilt as the wedding approaches, which complicates things. The author's resentment could stem from unmet expectations and the abrupt shift in their intimate relationship. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's feelings are valid because the engagement is a commitment, and major changes in behavior should be discussed. However, the fianc\u00e9e's reasons are personal and based on her values. The author might not be in the wrong for being upset, but the situation is more about differing expectations and communication. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The key here is whether the author is being unreasonable. They respected her initial reasons but were taken aback by the deeper issue. The resentment comes from the change in dynamics, not from pressuring her. So the answer might hinge on whether the fianc\u00e9e should have communicated her intention to wait earlier or if the author is expected to adjust to the new dynamic even if it's a personal choice the fianc\u00e9e made post-engagement. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they didn't force the fianc\u00e9e to be in the engagement or marriage. The issue is about unmet expectations and the sudden shift. But maybe there's a gray area. If the author is now resentful, it's a problem, but whether that makes them the asshole. The fianc\u00e9e's reasons are personal, but the author's feelings are also real. The answer might be B\u2014no, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
