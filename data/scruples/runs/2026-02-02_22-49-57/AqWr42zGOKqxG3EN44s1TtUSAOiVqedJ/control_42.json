Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted on AITA is in the wrong. The situation is that the fianc\u00e9's sex drive dropped after engagement, and she's now saying she wants to wait until marriage. The author is upset because they didn't agree to that when they started dating, and now they're feeling resentful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is engaging in a debate about expectations in a relationship. When they got engaged, maybe there was an unspoken assumption about intimacy continuing as before. However, the fianc\u00e9 has her reasons rooted in her Catholic background and personal feelings about her virginity. She communicated this after some time, which the author is now upset about.\n\nThe key points here: Did the author agree to wait until marriage? The answer is no. The fianc\u00e9 changed her stance after engagement, which wasn't discussed beforehand. The author is upset because their expectations weren't met. But is the author in the wrong for feeling that way? Well, relationships require communication and mutual agreement. If the fianc\u00e9 changed her mind without discussing it upfront, that's an issue. But the author is now resenting her for that change, even though they didn't set boundaries earlier. \n\nHowever, the author didn't address the issue until after it had been a problem for a year. They respected her initial reasons but didn't push further. Now, the fianc\u00e9 is bringing up new reasons related to her religion and personal values. The author might feel that the timing is inconvenient, but if they didn't agree to wait, the fianc\u00e9 isn't necessarily wrong for changing her stance. However, the author isn't wrong for being upset either. \n\nIn these cases, AITA often depends on whether there was prior agreement. Since there wasn't, the author might not be the asshole for feeling wronged. The fianc\u00e9's responsibility was to communicate her needs earlier. The author's resentment is valid if they expected the previous arrangement to continue. So, the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. But I need to check if the author is overstepping by resenting her for a decision she made after the engagement, which wasn't mutually agreed upon. Maybe the author should have discussed expectations about post-engagement intimacy earlier. But since the fianc\u00e9 changed her mind without prior discussion, the author's frustration is understandable. So, probably B.\n"
