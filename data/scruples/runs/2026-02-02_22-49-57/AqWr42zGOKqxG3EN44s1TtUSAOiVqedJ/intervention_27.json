Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 whose sex drive dropped after they got engaged. The author is upset because their fianc\u00e9 is now waiting until marriage to have sex, a decision that came after the engagement, not before. They feel it's a change in their dynamic and are starting to resent it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's fianc\u00e9 had a good sex life pre-engagement but now, influenced by her Catholic background and friends, wants to wait until marriage. She mentioned body image issues earlier, which might have been a red herring. The author feels they didn't agree to this arrangement when they started dating and now the change is causing tension.\n\nI think the key points here are communication and mutual expectations. When they started dating, neither of them was waiting for marriage. The fianc\u00e9's decision to wait came after the engagement, which the author didn't anticipate. The author is now feeling unmet needs and resentment. But is the author in the wrong for being upset?\n\nThe author respected the initial reasons (body image) but when the real reason was revealed, it's a different issue. The fianc\u00e9's change in behavior is a significant shift in their relationship dynamic. The author isn't asking to force sex but is expressing being upset because their needs aren't being met. However, the fianc\u00e9 has her own values and reasons, which might be valid to her.\n\nIs the author wrong for feeling this way? Probably not. It's normal to feel frustrated if your expectations aren't met. However, the author might need to consider if this is a dealbreaker and if they can find a compromise. The fianc\u00e9's decision is based on her beliefs, which she might not be able to easily change. The author's resentment is understandable but not necessarily \"wrong.\" The question is whether the author's feelings make them the asshole. Since they are in a committed engagement and planning marriage, they need to address this through communication, but the author isn't in the wrong for feeling upset. The fianc\u00e9's actions are her choice, but the author's reaction is a valid emotional response.\n"
