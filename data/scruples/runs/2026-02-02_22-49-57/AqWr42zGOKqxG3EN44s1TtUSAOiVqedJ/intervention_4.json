Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 whose sex drive has dropped after they got engaged, and he's upset about it. The fianc\u00e9e gave reasons related to her Catholic upbringing and wanting to wait until after marriage, but they didn't agree on this before getting engaged.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is upset because their fianc\u00e9e's sudden change in behavior is affecting their relationship. They had a good sex life before engagement but now it's almost nonexistent. The fianc\u00e9e's reasons are about body image and religious beliefs, which are valid personal issues. However, the author feels they didn't agree to wait until marriage when they started dating, so this change is causing conflict.\n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. They had conversations about the decrease in sex, and the fianc\u00e9e eventually explained her reasons. The author respected her initial explanations (body image) but later found out she felt guilty about past relationships and wanted to wait. The problem is that this decision came after they were engaged, which the author didn't agree to. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after the engagement, which wasn't discussed beforehand. The author is upset because their expectations were unmet. However, the fianc\u00e9e's reasons are based on her personal values and upbringing. The author could be in the right if they felt this was a deal-breaker and didn't discuss it before engagement. But if they didn't address it, maybe they share some responsibility for not setting boundaries. However, the fianc\u00e9e's decision came as a surprise, which might make the author's frustration understandable. \n\nIn relationships, both partners should have open discussions about their expectations. Since the fianc\u00e9e changed her mind post-engagement, the author's resentment makes sense. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's respectful and trying to communicate, then maybe not. On the other hand, if he's pressuring her against her beliefs, that's different. The fianc\u00e9e also needs to take responsibility for not communicating her needs earlier. \n\nI think the author is not entirely in the wrong because the fianc\u00e9e made a significant change in behavior without prior agreement. The author's feelings of resentment are valid given the lack of prior discussion. However, the situation is complex and might require more negotiation. The answer would likely be B (No), but I need to make sure I'm not missing something. The author could be missing the fact that the fianc\u00e9e's reasons are genuine, but the main issue is the timing and lack of prior agreement. So yes, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
