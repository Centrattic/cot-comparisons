  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for wanting to have sex with my fiance?\nMy fiance and I have been engaged for a year and are getting married in a few months. Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 whose sex drive has dropped after engagement, leading to tension. The author is upset because the fianc\u00e9e is now choosing to wait until marriage for sex, which wasn't part of their initial agreement.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The fianc\u00e9e's reasons include body image issues and religious guilt, stemming from a Catholic background. She mentions that her friends waited until marriage, even though she and the author didn't. The author is frustrated because their dynamic has changed, and they're feeling resentful.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author respected her initial reasons but is now upset because the fianc\u00e9e's stance changed post-engagement. The fianc\u00e9e's decision is based on personal and religious beliefs, which are valid. However, the author didn't expect this change and feels they didn't agree to this arrangement when they started dating.\n\nIn relationships, it's important that both partners communicate their needs and boundaries. The author might feel that the fianc\u00e9e didn't clarify this before engagement. However, the fianc\u00e9e is now making a choice that aligns with her beliefs, even if it's different from their previous understanding. The author's resentment could be due to unmet expectations, but it's not clear if there was prior discussion about post-marriage sexual expectations. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9e's decision is her right, based on her values. However, the author's feelings of being upset are also valid. Since the fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after engagement without prior discussion, the author's frustration is understandable. But if the author didn't address this before the wedding, maybe he's partially responsible. However, it's a complex situation where both partners have valid points. \n\nConsidering all factors, the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong because the fianc\u00e9e's decision is a personal choice, and the author is reacting to a change in circumstances. However, the author should communicate his feelings to find a mutual solution. But based on the scenario, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
