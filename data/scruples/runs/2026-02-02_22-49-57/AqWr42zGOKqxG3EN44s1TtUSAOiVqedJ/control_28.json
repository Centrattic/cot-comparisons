Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nThe author is engaged and wants to have sex with their fianc\u00e9e. Before the engagement, they had a good sex life, but after getting engaged, it dropped significantly. The fianc\u00e9e cited body image issues and now, after some discussion, revealed she's feeling guilty due to her Catholic upbringing and wants to wait until after marriage for future sex. The author is upset because they didn't agree to this arrangement when they started dating, and they're resentful now that the dynamic has changed.\n\nHmm. The key points here are communication and prior agreements. When they started dating, neither of them agreed to wait until marriage. The fianc\u00e9e's change in stance came after the engagement. The author is frustrated because their expectations changed post-engagement. But the fianc\u00e9e has her reasons rooted in personal beliefs and religious background. She's also being honest about her feelings now. \n\nThe author is upset because they feel the sex drive shift is a new issue they didn't sign up for. But the fianc\u00e9e is honest and upfront now, even if it's after the engagement. The author respected her initial reasons (body image), but now there's a deeper reason. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being upset. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, both partners should communicate their needs. The author might feel neglected, but the fianc\u00e9e is also being truthful about her feelings. The author didn't expect this change and is struggling with the shift. However, the fianc\u00e9e hasn't broken any prior agreement; she's adjusting her stance based on her values now. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They are expressing valid feelings of being upset. However, they didn't agree to wait until marriage initially. The fianc\u00e9e is now choosing to wait, which is her right. The author's resentment might stem from unmet expectations, but the fianc\u00e9e is honest and they can discuss solutions. The author isn't necessarily wrong for feeling upset, but they need to address it through communication rather than resentment. The answer might be B (No), because the author isn't wrong for feeling this way, but they need to work on it with their partner.\n"
