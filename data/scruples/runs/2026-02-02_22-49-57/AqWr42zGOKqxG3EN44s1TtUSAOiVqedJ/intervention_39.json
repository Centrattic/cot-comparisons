Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a fianc\u00e9 whose partner's sex drive dropped significantly after engagement, leading to the author feeling upset and resentful. The fianc\u00e9 gives reasons like body image issues and religious guilt about not waiting until marriage.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is feeling frustrated because their expectations regarding intimacy changed after the engagement. The fianc\u00e9 had different reasons for her change in behavior, including personal and religious beliefs. The key points here are consent, communication, and prior agreements.\n\nWhen they started dating, neither expected to wait until marriage, so this new stance from the fianc\u00e9 is a recent change. The author didn't agree to this at the time of engagement, which might be a conflict. However, the fianc\u00e9 is now facing her own feelings of guilt and insecurities. The author's resentment comes from the change in their relationship dynamic, which is understandable. \n\nBut wait, is the author in the wrong for not respecting her decision now? They did communicate, and she's given emotional reasons. However, the author's feelings are valid because their needs aren't being met. The question is whether the author's frustration makes them the asshole. \n\nIn relationships, both partners need to negotiate their comfort levels. The fianc\u00e9 changed her stance post-engagement, which the author didn't consent to. The author is justified in feeling upset because their needs are not being met, but the fianc\u00e9 has her reasons. However, the author's resentment might be misplaced if they didn't discuss this issue more thoroughly before engagement. But since the engagement was a year ago and the issue arose later, maybe the author is not in the wrong here. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're dealing with a partner who changed her stance without prior agreement, leading to valid feelings of frustration. The fianc\u00e9 has her reasons, but the author isn't wrong for being upset about the change.\n"
