Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is the asshole (AITA) for wanting to have sex with their fianc\u00e9e, given the situation described.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The person and their fianc\u00e9e have been engaged for a year, with a wedding coming up. Their sex life was good before engagement but dropped significantly after. The fianc\u00e9e initially blamed body issues like weight gain and psoriasis, but after some discussion, she revealed she felt guilty about having sex before marriage due to her Catholic upbringing and friends' expectations. The author is upset because they didn't agree to this change, and it's causing resentment.\n\nSo, the main question is: Is the author in the wrong for being upset about this change in their fianc\u00e9e's stance on sex?\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author's perspective: they respected her initial reasons, but when it turned out to be a deeper issue related to her religious background and timing (only becoming an issue after engagement), they feel blindsided and resentful. The fianc\u00e9e's perspective: she's dealing with guilt, possibly influenced by her upbringing and friends, and made a change after the engagement, which might not have been discussed clearly at the start.\n\nKey points to consider: Communication, mutual expectations before engagement, the timing of the change, and the impact on the relationship. Did the fianc\u00e9e communicate her desire to wait until marriage before the engagement? If not, that might be a problem. The author might feel that the terms of the relationship changed without prior agreement. However, people can change their views, especially with life events like engagement. The author's resentment is valid if they feel the change was unexpected and not discussed upfront.\n\nAlso, the fianc\u00e9e's reasons (religious guilt, friends' influence) are personal, but the author's needs and feelings are also important. The fact that the change happened after the engagement, when the wedding is imminent, adds pressure. The author might feel that the engagement was based on different expectations.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Maybe not. They're expressing their feelings of being upset when their fianc\u00e9e changed her stance without prior discussion. However, the fianc\u00e9e might also be in a difficult position, dealing with her own guilt. The core issue is communication and whether expectations were set before the engagement. If the fianc\u00e9e didn't mention this before engagement, the author isn't wrong to feel upset. The answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because the author's feelings are valid given the lack of prior discussion and the significant change post-engagement.\n"
