Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's fianc\u00e9e deciding to wait until after marriage to have sex, which is causing tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The couple has been engaged for a year and is getting married soon. Before engagement, their sex life was good, but after engagement, it dropped significantly. The fianc\u00e9e initially blamed body issues but later admitted to feelings of guilt due to her Catholic upbringing and wanting to wait until marriage. The author is upset because they didn't agree on this when they started dating and feels their dynamic has changed, leading to resentment.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (Yes) or B (No). The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants confirmation.\n\nI should evaluate the situation from both sides. The author's fianc\u00e9e changed her stance on sex after engagement, which wasn't discussed beforehand. The author feels this decision is affecting their relationship negatively. However, the fianc\u00e9e has valid reasons rooted in her personal beliefs and upbringing. \n\nThe author's frustration is understandable since expectations weren't aligned. However, both parties might have different values. The author didn't agree to waiting until marriage initially, so the fianc\u00e9e's decision post-engagement could be a shift in her own values, not necessarily a betrayal. \n\nBut the author is upset because the change came after they were already engaged. Did they have a pre-engagement discussion about future sexual expectations? If not, the author might not be in the wrong for being upset, as the change in plans affects their current relationship. However, the fianc\u00e9e's reasons are personal and based on her beliefs. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's resentment is justified. If they didn't agree on this aspect when they started dating, and the fianc\u00e9e made a decision post-engagement, the author could feel wronged. But the fianc\u00e9e isn't obligated to maintain a certain level of intimacy if her beliefs have changed. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both might share some. However, the question is about the author being in the wrong. Since the author is expressing their feelings of being wronged due to unmet expectations and resulting resentment, they might not be in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9e's decision is her right, but the author's reaction is valid given their prior understanding. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No). The author isn't in the wrong for being upset about the change in their fianc\u00e9e's decision post-engagement, especially since it wasn't discussed beforehand and is causing relationship strain.\n"
