  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for wanting to have sex with my fiance?\nMy fiance and I have been engaged for a year and are getting married in a few months. Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about the author's fianc\u00e9e's sudden change in sex drive after they got engaged. The author is upset because they used to have a good sex life, but now it's dropped significantly. The fianc\u00e9e mentioned body image issues at first, but later revealed she's feeling guilty about not losing her virginity as she wanted and wants to wait until after marriage. The author is upset because they didn't agree beforehand to wait, and now they're resentful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is in a committed relationship, engaged, and had expectations based on their previous sexual relationship. The fianc\u00e9e didn't communicate her feelings about waiting until after marriage until after they were engaged. The author might feel blindsided because they didn't agree to this change in their sexual dynamic. However, the fianc\u00e9e is coming from a religious background and has personal reasons related to guilt and societal expectations. She's also dealing with body image issues, which could affect her libido.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author is expressing their feelings of being upset and resentful, which is understandable if their needs aren't being met. However, the fianc\u00e9e did communicate her reasons, even if it took time. The author might have expected more communication from the start, but they did respect her initial reasons. The key point is whether the author's expectations were reasonable. Since they didn't agree to wait until marriage initially, the fianc\u00e9e's change in stance after engagement could be seen as a shift in terms. But the author might not be the asshole because they're voicing their feelings and seeking resolution. The fianc\u00e9e is also dealing with personal issues, but the author's resentment is a valid emotional response. So, the answer might be B (No), but I need to check if there's any wrongdoing on the author's part. The author isn't doing anything unethical; they're expressing their feelings and seeking understanding. The issue is a communication problem and differing expectations, not necessarily the author being wrong.\n"
