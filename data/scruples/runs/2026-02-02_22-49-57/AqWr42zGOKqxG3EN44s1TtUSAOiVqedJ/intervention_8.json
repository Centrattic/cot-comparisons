Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this situation. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for wanting to have sex with their fianc\u00e9e after a significant drop in their sex life post-engagement. The fianc\u00e9e's reasons include body image issues and Catholic guilt about not waiting until marriage. The author feels they didn't agree to wait until marriage when they started dating, which is a new development after the engagement.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They were already in a sexual relationship before engagement. The fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after engagement, citing personal and religious reasons. The author is upset because the dynamic has shifted, leading to resentment. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual expectations. When they got engaged, maybe expectations around intimacy weren't fully discussed. The fianc\u00e9e's reasons are personal, but the author feels it's a recent change. The author's resentment comes from unmet expectations. However, the fianc\u00e9e has her own reasons, which are valid in her context.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for wanting to have sex? Well, wanting a sexual relationship isn't inherently wrong. The problem arises if there's a lack of communication or if one party is pressuring the other. The author has tried to respect her reasons initially but is now feeling upset because the situation hasn't changed. The fianc\u00e9e's decision to wait post-marriage might be a personal choice influenced by her background, but she had a different stance when they started dating. \n\nThe author's resentment might stem from feeling that a new rule was introduced without prior agreement. However, people can have evolving values, and the fianc\u00e9e's decision isn't necessarily manipulative. The author's frustration is understandable, but the fianc\u00e9e is also within her rights to change her mind. The issue here is about mutual understanding and whether both parties are on the same page. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting intimacy, but the situation highlights a need for deeper communication and possibly counseling to address the underlying issues.\n"
