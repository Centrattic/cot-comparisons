Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nSo, the author is engaged and says their fianc\u00e9e's sex drive dropped after they got engaged. Initially, she blamed body issues, but later admitted she wants to wait until after marriage to have sex again. She comes from a religious background, and this change in her stance is causing tension. The author feels upset and resents her for changing the dynamic. They're asking if they're the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author isn't in the wrong if they're being honest about their feelings and the fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after they were already engaged. But maybe there's more to it. Did they agree on anything about their sex life before engagement? The question states they didn't plan to wait, so the fianc\u00e9e changing her mind later might be the issue here.\n\nThe fianc\u00e9e's reasons are about her Catholic background and wanting to wait until marriage. That's her personal choice, but she didn't mention this before they got engaged. The author might feel betrayed or like the terms of their relationship have changed without prior agreement. The key point is that the fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after the engagement, which the author didn't expect. \n\nAlso, the author is respecting her reasons but is upset because their expectations weren't met. The fianc\u00e9e might be dealing with guilt, but the author's feelings of resentment are valid if they had a prior understanding. The question is whether the author's resentment makes them the asshole. Since the fianc\u00e9e changed her position post-engagement, the author isn't wrong to be upset. They didn't agree to waiting until marriage when they started dating, so the fianc\u00e9e's last-minute change is the problem here. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
