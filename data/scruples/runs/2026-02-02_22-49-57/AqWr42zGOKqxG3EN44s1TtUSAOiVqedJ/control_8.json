Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in their situation. The scenario is about a fianc\u00e9 whose sex drive dropped after getting engaged, leading to conflict. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author wants to know if they're the asshole (AITA) for being upset about their fianc\u00e9e's sudden change in sexual behavior after engagement. The fianc\u00e9e claims she's feeling guilty about past sexual activity and wants to wait until marriage, which wasn't part of their original agreement.\n\nSo, the key points here: They were happy with their sex life before engagement. After engagement, it decreased. The fianc\u00e9e had body image issues but also brings up religious reasons for wanting to wait. The author feels they didn't agree to wait until marriage and now feels resentful.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. From an ethical standpoint, both parties need to have mutual consent and understanding in their relationship. The fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after the engagement, which wasn't part of their initial agreement. The author is upset because their expectations aren't being met. \n\nBut maybe the fianc\u00e9e has valid reasons related to her beliefs. However, the author had no say in this change. It's important to consider communication. If the fianc\u00e9e was upfront before engagement, maybe the author would have had a different response. But she brought it up after the commitment, which complicates things.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they were both not virgins and didn't choose to wait before. Now she wants to wait, which seems like a personal change. The author is frustrated because this isn't what they agreed to. The resentment is understandable if there's a lack of prior discussion.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, maybe the fianc\u00e9e should have addressed her feelings earlier. However, the author's frustration is valid if they feel their needs aren't being considered. It's a complex situation where both might have some responsibility. But the question is specifically about the author's wrongdoing.\n\nIf the author is angry because the fianc\u00e9e changed the terms after engagement without prior discussion, then the author isn't necessarily wrong for feeling upset. However, if the author is trying to pressure the fianc\u00e9e into sex despite her religious convictions, that could be problematic. But the author's main issue is about the change in expectations and communication. \n\nI think the answer is B (No) because the author isn't in the wrong. The fianc\u00e9e changed her stance after the engagement, and the author is justified in feeling upset if this wasn't discussed beforehand. The key is whether the author is respecting her boundaries. Since the fianc\u00e9e is now stating her wishes, the author might need to adjust, but the initial anger is about the change in expectations. So the author isn't wrong for being upset, but maybe both need to work on communication.\n"
