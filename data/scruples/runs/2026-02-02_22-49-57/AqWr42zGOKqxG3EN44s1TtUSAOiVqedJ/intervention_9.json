Before we were engaged, we had a pretty good sex life. After we got engaged, her sex drive plummeted. We have had conversations about it, and at first she chalked it up to some body issues like weight gain and some minor psoriasis. I respected this, figured she would come around and decided not to press it. What I didn't expect was going from being sexual 3 times a week to maybe twice in the past year. I had my suspicions that this wasn't just body issues so I finally confronted her about it, and after some serious prying she explained that she didn't loose her virginity to her last boyfriend how she wanted to and that she thinks she wants to wait until after we are married to continue having sex. All her friends waited until marriage to have sex for the first time, and neither her nor I chose to take that route and have been with different people since. She also comes from a deeply religious Catholic background, and she claims to be feeling guilty now that our wedding is coming up. Am I the asshole for being upset about this? I can respect waiting until marriage, but I didn't sign up for it when we started dating and neither did she. It was only until after we got engaged that suddenly it mattered. Our whole dynamic has changed and I hate to admit that I'm beginning to resent her for it. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a fianc\u00e9 whose partner's sex drive dropped after the engagement. The fianc\u00e9 is upset because the partner wants to wait until after marriage, even though they didn't choose that route when they started dating. The author is frustrated and starting to resent the partner.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The fianc\u00e9 is engaged, so there's an expectation of a committed relationship where intimacy is part of the norm. They had a good sex life before engagement, and now it's significantly reduced. The partner's reasons include religious guilt and a desire to wait until marriage, which wasn't part of their initial agreement. The author is upset because this change happened after the engagement, which might feel like a shift in commitment terms without prior discussion.\n\nThe key points here are the change in behavior post-engagement and the reasons given. The author is respecting the partner's feelings about body image initially, but then it turns out the main issue is about waiting until marriage. The author didn't agree to this condition when they started dating, so expecting a change in the relationship dynamic without prior agreement could be a point of contention.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? If they didn't agree to waiting until marriage, and their partner is now imposing that without prior discussion, the author's frustration is understandable. However, the partner's reasons are based on personal beliefs and religious upbringing, which are valid for her. The author is upset because the dynamic has changed without mutual agreement. But is it the author's fault for being upset when the terms of their sexual relationship changed without mutual consent?\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The partner did eventually explain her reasons, but maybe the change should have been discussed earlier. The author is not wrong to feel upset if they didn't agree to this shift. However, they should also consider that the partner's feelings and beliefs are legitimate. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for being upset, but maybe there's a need for better communication moving forward. The question is whether the author is an asshole (ITA) for feeling this way. The answer would likely be B (No), because the author's feelings are valid if the terms of the relationship changed without mutual agreement.\n"
