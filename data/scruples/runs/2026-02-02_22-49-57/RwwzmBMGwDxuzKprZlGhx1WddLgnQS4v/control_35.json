When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the father is in the wrong for giving his son money without his wife's knowledge. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the parents agreed to let their son live at home while he's at university. The family isn't struggling financially, but there's a big disparity in how each family member's money is managed. The wife scolds the son for spending $7 on a meal, but the dad later gives the son money secretly. The dad then points out her spending $160 on perfume, highlighting the inconsistency. \n\nNow, the core issue here is whether the dad is wrong for giving money to his son without the wife's consent. Let's consider the dynamics. The parents are supposed to be a team in managing family finances, especially when they've made agreements about supporting their son. The dad's action of giving money without informing the wife might breach that agreement, even if his intention is to help his son. The wife's reaction could stem from feeling that the son is being spoiled or that the dad isn't consistent with the family's financial rules. \n\nHowever, there's a valid point about fairness. The wife seems to be critical of the son for a small expense while spending a much larger amount on herself. The dad's action might be a way to balance that perceived unfairness. But the key here is communication. Even if there's a disagreement in priorities, acting unilaterally without discussing it with the spouse can cause resentment. The dad didn't talk to his wife about the money; he just gave it to the son in secret. That lack of communication is a problem. \n\nAlso, the parents had an agreement about the son staying at home. If the dad is providing extra money without the wife knowing, it might undermine that agreement. The wife might feel disrespected or that the dad is not on the same page with her. Even if the dad's intention is good, the method of handling it without his wife's input is problematic. \n\nAnother angle is the son's maturity. The dad mentions the son is responsible with money, which is a positive. But the parents as a unit need to present a united front. The dad's intervention could create confusion for the son if the mom is still strict about expenses. It's possible the son might not know who to listen to, which isn't ideal. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the dad might be trying to correct the wife's inconsistency, but the way he's doing it is by circumventing her. That's where the issue lies. The right approach would be to discuss their differing views on expenses and find a compromise, rather than one parent acting behind the other's back. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the dad's intention to support his son and address the wife's inconsistency is understandable, but the method of doing it without her knowledge is where he's in the wrong. The problem is the lack of communication and teamwork in managing their shared household and parenting decisions.\n"
