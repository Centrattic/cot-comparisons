When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the father is giving money to his son without the wife's knowledge, and there's some conflict over spending habits.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics. The parents agreed to let the son stay at home during university. The wife criticizes the son for spending $7 on a meal, but the father points out she spent $160 on perfume. The father then starts giving the son money secretly.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. But what about the wife's perspective? She might feel that the father is undermining her by giving the son money without consulting her. Money management is usually a joint responsibility in a marriage, so not discussing this with her could be an issue. Also, the wife's criticism of the son might be disproportionate, but that's a separate issue. The main question is about the father's action of giving money without her knowledge.\n\nIs the father respecting the wife's authority in financial matters? If they agreed to let the son stay at home, maybe the parents had an agreement on expenses. If the father is bypassing the wife, it could create resentment. Even if the wife's behavior seems unfair, the father should probably address it with her rather than take unilateral action. So maybe the father is in the wrong for not communicating with his wife about this decision. The answer might be A.\n"
