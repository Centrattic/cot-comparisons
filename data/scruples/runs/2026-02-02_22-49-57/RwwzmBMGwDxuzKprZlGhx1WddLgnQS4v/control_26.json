When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a parent giving money to their son without the wife knowing. The parents agreed to let their son live at home while he's in university. The wife is upset when she sees the son spend $7 on food, but she buys a $160 perfume. The father talks to the son about the $7, but when he notices the wife's perfume, he confronts her, which upsets her. Then he starts giving the son money secretly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The parents are supposed to be managing their finances together as a household. If the father is giving money to the son without the wife's knowledge, that could be seen as undermining their shared financial decisions. Even though the wife's $160 perfume seems like a bigger expense, the father's approach might be causing more issues. \n\nThe key points are: 1) The parents agreed on the son living at home, but the father is acting against the wife's wishes. 2) The father is trying to balance the spending by giving the son money, but this is done without the wife's consent. 3) The wife's reaction to the son's spending versus her own might be a point of contention, but the father's secret action could be seen as a breach of trust between him and the wife.\n\nEven though the father's intention is to support his son and address what he perceives as unfair criticism, keeping the wife in the dark about financial decisions is problematic. In a marriage, shared financial responsibilities and communication are important. By not involving the wife, the father might be causing more tension rather than resolving it. The wife's upset reaction suggests that she feels disrespected or that her opinions are being dismissed, which the father's actions could exacerbate.\n\nSo, the father's actions might be a way to support his son, but the lack of transparency with the wife is likely the main issue here. The answer would hinge on whether acting without the spouse's knowledge is considered wrong in a marital context, regardless of the intent.\n"
