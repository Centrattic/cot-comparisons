When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the father is in the wrong for giving his son money without his wife's knowledge.\n\nFirst, the context: The family isn't struggling financially, but there's a big disparity in how each member spends. The wife criticizes the son for a $7 meal, while she spends $160 on perfume. The father feels the wife is being unfair, so he starts giving the son money secretly.\n\nThe key points here are about fairness and communication. The father's action is a response to what he perceives as the wife's inconsistency in spending habits. However, the main issue is that he bypassed his wife without discussing it. Even if he disagrees with her approach, handling it behind her back could damage trust. In a relationship, transparency is crucial. The father might believe he's helping the son, but without mutual agreement, it could lead to more conflict. The wife's reaction to the perfume vs. the meal might be about different priorities, but that doesn't justify the father's secret actions. He should have addressed the spending habits as a couple first rather than taking unilateral steps. So, the answer is likely A, he's in the wrong for not communicating and involving his wife in the decision.\n"
