When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this scenario is in the wrong for giving their son money without the wife's knowledge. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The parents agreed to let their son live at home during university. The father notices a discrepancy in how money is spent. The son spends $7 on a meal, which the wife criticizes, but then the father later sees the wife spend $160 on perfume. The father is upset about the inconsistency and starts giving the son money in secret to help him out, since the son uses the money responsibly.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the father is trying to address what he perceives as unfair treatment by the wife towards the son. He's giving the son money without the wife's knowledge because he believes the son is being unfairly criticized for small expenses while the wife spends more on herself. The father's intention is to support his son and correct the imbalance he sees.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. The main issue is the secrecy. The wife wasn't informed about the money being given to the son. In a marriage, financial decisions, especially ones involving children, should ideally be made together. By not discussing this with his wife, the father is acting unilaterally, which could lead to more conflict. Even if his intention is good, keeping this a secret could undermine trust and communication between the couple.\n\nHowever, the father's motivation is to support his son and address what he sees as unfair criticism. The wife's reaction to the son's $7 meal might be seen as overly critical, especially compared to her own $160 spend. The father might believe that the son should have some financial freedom and that the wife is being unreasonable. But the method of giving money without the wife's knowledge is problematic because it doesn't involve her in the decision-making process.\n\nIn terms of parental responsibility, both parents should agree on how to handle their children's finances, especially if they're contributing to their education. The father might be trying to correct a perceived imbalance, but doing so without discussing it with the wife could lead to more issues. The wife might feel disrespected or that her opinions are being ignored, which could escalate the conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, the father's actions could be seen as a way to protect his son from unnecessary criticism and provide him with some independence. If the wife is indeed being overly strict, the father's intervention might be necessary. However, the appropriate approach would be to communicate with the wife about the concerns rather than acting in secret.\n\nSo, the question is whether the secrecy is the wrong part. If the father had discussed his intention to give the son money to balance out the wife's criticism, that would be better. But by not involving the wife, he's making a decision that affects their family's finances and their son's upbringing without her input. This could be seen as the father overstepping, even if his intentions are good.\n\nTherefore, while the father's intention might be to support his son and address an unfair situation, the method of doing so without the wife's knowledge is problematic. The issue isn't necessarily the act of giving money but the lack of communication and collaboration with his spouse. So, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong for not including his wife in the decision.\n"
