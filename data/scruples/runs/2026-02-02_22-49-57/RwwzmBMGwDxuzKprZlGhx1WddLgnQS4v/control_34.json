When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a dad giving his son money without his wife's knowledge. The parents agreed to let their son stay at home while he's in university. The family isn't poor, but there's a big difference in how much each family member spends. The dad says his son was scolded by his wife for spending $7 on a meal, and she later spent $160 on perfume. The dad then started giving his son money secretly because he thought the wife was being unfair.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The couple is supposed to be on the same page about finances, especially when it comes to their children. If the dad didn't talk to his wife about giving money to their son, that could be a problem. Even if the dad felt his wife was being overly strict about the $7 meal, he should have addressed it with her instead of bypassing her. By giving the son money without her knowledge, he's undermining her and creating a secret system. That might lead to more conflict. The wife's reaction to the perfume versus the meal might be about different priorities, but the dad's solution was to act without her consent, which isn't great. It's important for spouses to communicate and agree on financial decisions for their kids. So, yes, the dad is in the wrong for not discussing this with his wife first.\n"
