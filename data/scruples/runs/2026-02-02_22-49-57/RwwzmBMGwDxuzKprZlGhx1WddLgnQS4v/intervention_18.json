When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving their son money without the wife's knowledge. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the parents agreed to let the son live at home during university. The author mentions that money isn't an obstacle, but there's a big disparity in how family members spend. The wife criticized the son for spending $7 on a meal, but then the author found out she spent $160 on perfume. The author then decided to give the son money secretly because he's responsible with it.\n\nSo, the key points here are about fairness in spending and communication. The wife is upset about the son's small expense but spends much more on herself. The author feels this is unfair and wants to support the son. However, the author did this without discussing it with the wife, which could be a problem.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. On one hand, the author might believe they're correcting an unfair situation by supporting their son. On the other hand, not discussing financial decisions with a spouse can lead to trust issues. The author's action might be seen as undermining the wife's authority or not respecting joint financial decisions. Even if the wife's criticism seems disproportionate, the right approach would be to address the spending habits together rather than bypassing her.\n\nAlso, giving money without the spouse's knowledge could set a precedent. The wife might feel disrespected or that she's not part of the parenting decisions. The author should consider communication and resolving the spending habits issue as a couple rather than acting in secret. So, the author might be in the wrong not because of the act itself, but because of the lack of communication and potential erosion of trust. The correct answer would be A (Yes), as the author acted without transparency, which is a mistake in a marital relationship.\n"
