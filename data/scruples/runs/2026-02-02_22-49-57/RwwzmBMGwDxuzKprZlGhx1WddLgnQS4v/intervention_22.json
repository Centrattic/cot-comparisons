When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving their son money without the wife's knowledge. \n\nFirst, the situation: The parents agreed to let their son live at home while he goes to university. Money isn't an issue, but there's an imbalance in how each family member spends. The son was reprimanded for spending $7 on a meal, while the wife bought a $160 perfume. The father confronts the wife about the inconsistency, then starts giving the son money secretly.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The father's action is a response to what he perceives as unfair treatment by his wife. He's trying to balance the financial expectations. But he did it without her knowledge, which could be a problem. Communication is key in a marriage. Even if the wife's criticism of the son seems harsh, the father's solution was to act alone, which might undermine their partnership.\n\nIs the father right to give money secretly? On one hand, he's protecting his son from his wife's criticism. On the other hand, he's not being transparent with his wife, which could cause more issues. The wife's reaction to the perfume price versus the son's meal might be valid or not, but the father's response is to bypass her instead of discussing the issue openly.\n\nAlso, the father's action might set a precedent. If he's giving money without mutual agreement, it could lead to more conflicts. The wife might feel disrespected or excluded from decisions about their child's finances. Even if the son uses the money responsibly, the method of providing it without the wife's knowledge is questionable.\n\nSo, the father's intention might be good, but the approach is flawed. The right thing would have been to address the wife's behavior directly, perhaps through a conversation about financial expectations and consistency, rather than taking unilateral action. Therefore, the father is in the wrong because he didn't communicate with his wife and acted behind her back, which could harm their relationship despite his good intentions.\n"
