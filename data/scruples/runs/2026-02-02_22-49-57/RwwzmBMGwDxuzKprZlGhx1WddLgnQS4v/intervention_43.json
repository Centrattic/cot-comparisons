When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a parent giving their son money without the wife's knowledge. The wife and husband are co-parents, so there might be some expectations about how decisions are made regarding their children.\n\nFirst, the parents agreed that the son would stay at home while in university. The author mentions that money isn't an issue, but there's a perceived imbalance in how money is spent between the son and the wife. The son was scolded for a $7 meal, while the wife spent $160 on perfume. The father felt this was unfair and decided to give his son money secretly. \n\nSo, the key points here are: 1) The father acted without the wife's knowledge. 2) He's trying to address what he sees as unfair treatment. 3) The son uses the money responsibly. \n\nNow, in a co-parenting situation, even if the parents have disagreements, making decisions without the other parent's knowledge can lead to issues. It might undermine the wife's authority and create tension. The father's action, while well-intentioned, could be seen as undermining his wife's role in their parenting agreement. \n\nBut the father's argument is that the wife was being overly strict about the son's spending while she spent more on herself. However, even if the wife's reaction was harsh, the father bypassing her by giving money secretly might not be the right approach. It's possible that a better solution would have been to discuss the situation with his wife and find a compromise, rather than acting behind her back.\n\nOn the other hand, the father's intention was to protect his son and balance the financial expectations. The son is using the money responsibly. But the method of giving money without consent might be the problem. In a shared parenting arrangement, both parents should ideally agree on financial decisions for the child, even if they disagree on other matters.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's action of giving money without the wife's knowledge could be seen as wrong because it's a joint decision between the parents. Even if the wife's reaction was unfair, the father should have addressed it by communicating with her instead of acting unilaterally. That might have been more respectful to their partnership and the son's upbringing.\n"
