When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for giving their son money without the wife's knowledge. The situation involves some financial dynamics and communication issues between the parents.\n\nFirst, the parents agreed to let their son stay at home during university, which is probably to save him money. The dad mentions that money isn't an issue for the household, but there's a big disparity in how each family member's spending is treated. The wife criticized the son for spending $7 on a meal, while she herself spent $160 on perfume. The dad felt this was unfair, so he started giving the son money secretly to help him out, thinking the son is responsible with money.\n\nNow, the question is whether the dad is wrong. The user thinks he isn't, but wants to know my take. Let's break it down.\n\nThe main points are: the dad is trying to address what he perceives as unfair treatment by the mom. He gives the son money without her knowing, which could be seen as undermining her authority or financial decisions in the household. However, his intention is to support his son, which is a good one.\n\nBut in a marriage, financial decisions usually require mutual agreement. Even if the dad disagrees with the wife's spending habits, acting unilaterally by giving money to the son without discussing it could lead to trust issues. The wife might feel disrespected or that the dad isn't supporting her in parenting decisions. The dad's action might be seen as a way to bypass her, which could cause more conflict in the long run.\n\nOn the other hand, the dad is trying to correct what he sees as unfairness. If the wife is being overly critical of the son's reasonable spending while spending more on herself without question, the dad's intervention could be seen as balancing things out. But the method of doing it without her knowledge is problematic because it's unilateral and could harm their relationship.\n\nSo, the dad's intentions are good, but the approach is flawed. The key issue here is communication and mutual respect in the marriage. By not discussing this with his wife, he's not addressing the root of the problem but instead creating a new one. The right approach would have been to talk to his wife about the discrepancy in how they're treating their son's spending versus her own, and perhaps come to a mutual agreement on how to handle their son's finances during university.\n\nTherefore, the dad is in the wrong because he didn't communicate with his wife and acted alone, which could damage their trust and partnership. The answer should be A.\n"
