When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for giving their son money without the wife's knowledge. The options are A for yes and B for no.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The parents agreed to let their son stay at home during university. The dad notices that the mom is upset with the son for spending $7 on a meal, but she spends $160 on perfume. The dad then gives the son money secretly because he thinks it's unfair. The mom is upset when she finds out.\n\nSo, the key points here are about fairness in spending and communication. The dad's action is to support his son without the mom knowing, which might be a breach of trust. The question is whether this makes him wrong.\n\nI should consider both perspectives. From the dad's side, he's trying to correct what he sees as unfair treatment. The mom, however, might feel that the dad didn't respect her authority or the family's financial decisions. The fact that money isn't an issue in the household but the distribution is a problem adds complexity. The dad's action could be seen as undermining the mom's role in managing finances, even if his intention was good.\n\nAlso, giving money without the spouse's knowledge can lead to resentment. It's important for couples to communicate about financial decisions involving their children. The dad's approach lacked transparency, which might be the main issue here. Even if his intention was to help the son, doing it behind the wife's back could be seen as wrong because it affects the family's dynamic and trust.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom's reaction to the $7 meal seems harsh compared to her own spending, which the dad is trying to balance. But the solution should involve communication rather than secret actions. The dad's method is questionable regardless of the intention.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the dad's action is wrong because he didn't communicate with his wife and acted unilaterally, which could damage their relationship. The answer would be A.\n"
