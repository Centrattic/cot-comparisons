When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the father) is in the wrong for giving his son money without his wife's knowledge.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The parents agreed to let their son live at home while he's at university. Money isn't an issue in the household, but there's a big disparity in how each family member handles their finances. The wife criticized the son for spending $7 on a meal, but then the father noticed she spent $160 on perfume. The father confronts her, and later starts giving the son money without her knowing.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the wife's reaction to the son's spending vs. her own spending, the father's response to that discrepancy, and the father giving money to the son secretly. The key question is about the father's action of giving money without his wife's knowledge.\n\nI need to consider family dynamics and financial ethics here. In a marriage, major financial decisions are usually expected to be mutual. If the wife is managing the household finances, and the husband starts giving money to their son without consulting her, that could be seen as undermining her authority and creating a rift. Even if the father believes the wife is being unfair with the $7 comment compared to her $160 perfume, the solution of secretly giving money to the son might not be the best approach.\n\nThe father's intention might be to support his son and correct what he sees as the wife's injustice. However, bypassing the wife could lead to further conflict and lack of transparency in their marriage. It's possible that the father should have discussed the issue with his wife first, maybe negotiated a different approach to financial education for the son, rather than acting independently. \n\nAlso, the son is an adult and might benefit from learning about financial responsibility. The father's action might be shielding the son from learning how to handle money as an adult. But the father argues that the son is mature and uses the money wisely. Still, the key issue is the secrecy and the lack of communication with the wife. \n\nFinancial decisions in a marriage typically require mutual agreement. Even if the husband thinks the wife is being unreasonable, withholding the discussion and taking unilateral action can damage the trust between them. The husband's solution to a disagreement with his wife by involving their son might not be the healthiest approach.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the husband's action of giving money without his wife's knowledge is likely the wrong move because it disrupts the marital partnership's financial management and could exacerbate the conflict rather than resolve it. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
