When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving their son money without the wife's knowledge. The situation involves the parents agreeing to let their son stay at home while attending university. The wife criticizes the son for spending $7 on a meal, while the father spends $160 on perfume. The father then starts giving the son money secretly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The parents are supposed to be a team, right? If the wife is upset about the son's spending, maybe the father should have discussed it with her instead of acting alone. But the father feels the spending isn't fair since the wife spent more on perfume. However, giving money without her knowledge could be seen as undermining her authority or creating a double standard.\n\nOn one hand, the father is trying to support his son and address what he perceives as unfair treatment. On the other hand, not involving the wife in such a decision might cause conflict and could be seen as deceitful. The wife's reaction to the son's spending might be about teaching responsibility, while the father's action undermines that lesson by giving the son extra money.\n\nAlso, the fact that the family isn't short on money doesn't necessarily make the father right. The issue is more about communication and mutual agreement in a partnership. Without discussing it with the wife, the father's actions might lead to more arguments or resentment. So, maybe the father is in the wrong because he didn't communicate and acted behind the wife's back, even if his intentions were good.\n"
