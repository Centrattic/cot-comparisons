When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who gave their son money without the wife's knowledge is in the wrong. The story says that money isn't an issue for the family, but there's a big discrepancy in how each family member spends. The wife criticized the son for spending $7 on a meal, but then the dad found out she spent $160 on perfume. He gave the son money secretly because he felt the spending was unfair.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The parents agreed to let their son stay with them during university, so maybe they had an arrangement about expenses. The dad is trying to balance the unfair spending by giving his son money without the wife knowing. But is this the right approach? \n\nThe wife might feel disrespected if the dad is bypassing her decisions. Even if she's being unreasonable about the $7 meal, the dad's solution is to act behind her back. That could lead to more conflict. Maybe the better approach would be to talk to her about their spending habits and find a mutual agreement instead of secretly giving money. \n\nAlso, the son is an adult, so he might be managing his own finances, but since he's living at home, maybe there's an understanding about expenses. The dad's action could complicate things if the wife finds out. It's possible that the dad is trying to protect his son from criticism, but the secrecy might not be the healthiest way to handle it.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's reaction to the $7 meal while spending $160 on perfume does seem unfair. The dad is pointing out the inconsistency, so maybe he's right about the fairness. However, the method of giving money without her knowledge might not address the root issue and could cause more problems. \n\nSo, is the dad in the wrong? He's trying to correct an unfair situation, but his approach might be flawed. The key issue is the secrecy and not discussing it with his wife. If both parents had a conversation about their spending habits and agreed on a way to handle their son's expenses, that would be better. The dad's action, while well-intentioned, might be seen as undermining his wife's authority and creating more conflict. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not addressing the issue openly.\n"
