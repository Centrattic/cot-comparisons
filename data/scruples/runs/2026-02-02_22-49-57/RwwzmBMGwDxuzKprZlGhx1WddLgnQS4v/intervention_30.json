When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a parent giving their son money without the spouse's knowledge. The parents agreed to let their son live at home during university. Money isn't tight in the household, but there's a big difference in how much each family member spends. The wife criticized the son for spending $7 on a meal, while she spent $160 on perfume. The father then started giving the son money secretly, which the son uses responsibly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The key points are the unequal spending habits and the father's decision to bypass the wife. The wife's reaction to the son's spending versus her own might highlight a double standard. The father is trying to balance that by giving the son money, but without consulting the wife. \n\nNow, is the father wrong? Well, in a marriage, financial decisions are usually shared responsibilities. Even if there's a double standard, acting without the spouse's knowledge could be seen as undermining the partnership. The father might be trying to protect his son, but secrecy could lead to more conflict. The wife might feel disrespected or betrayed, even if the father's intention was good. On the other hand, the wife's criticism of the son seems unreasonable compared to her own spending, which the father is trying to correct. \n\nBut the main issue is whether the father had the right to act without the wife's knowledge. Even if the wife is being unfair, the father's solution is to bypass her, which could be problematic. Marital trust and communication are important. So, while the father's intention might be good, the method of keeping it secret without discussing it with the wife could be wrong. Therefore, there's a case for saying the author is in the wrong because he didn't communicate with his wife, even if her behavior was unfair.\n"
