When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the father (the author) is in the wrong for giving his son money without his wife's knowledge.\n\nFirst, the family situation: They live together during university, money isn't an issue, but there's a big difference in how each family member spends. The wife criticizes the son for $7 on a meal, but the father later spends a significant amount on perfume. The father then gives the son money secretly.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the father's action of giving money without his wife's knowledge. The wife's behavior seems inconsistent\u2014yelling at the son for a small expense while splurging on perfume. The father's response was to privately give the son money, perhaps to balance things out. But the wife isn't involved in that decision.\n\nIs the father wrong? Well, financially, they agreed to let the son stay at home. The father might feel the wife is being unfair, so he's trying to help the son. However, the father bypassed the wife, which could undermine their partnership. Even if the wife's criticism is unwarranted, the father should have discussed this with her instead of acting alone. Secretly giving money could lead to trust issues and financial disagreements. It's about respecting the wife's role in family decisions and maintaining open communication.\n\nSo, while the wife's behavior might be questionable, the father's secret action without discussing it with her could be seen as wrong. The answer is A.\n"
