When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the father is in the wrong for giving his son money without his wife's knowledge. Let's break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the family has enough money, but there's a big disparity in how each family member spends. The wife criticizes the son for spending $7 on a meal, while she spends $160 on perfume. The father steps in, defends the son, and starts giving him money secretly. The son uses the money responsibly, not on drugs or anything bad.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the father's decision to give money without telling his wife. Is that wrong? On one hand, the father is trying to address the unfairness he perceives. The wife's reaction seems disproportionate. But on the other hand, the father didn't discuss this with his wife first, which might have been the right thing to do. He might think it's his way of helping his son, but bypassing his wife could lead to trust issues. Also, maybe the wife has her own reasons for being strict, even if it seems unreasonable. The father could have talked to her about the $160 perfume and the $7 meal before secretly giving money to the son. So, while the father's intention is good, the method of not involving his wife might be where he's in the wrong. Alternatively, if the wife is being unfair, then the father's action could be justified. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong. Since the father didn't communicate with his wife and took action behind her back, that's a possible fault. So maybe the answer is A (yes), but I'm a bit torn because the wife's behavior is also questionable. However, the act of giving money without her knowledge is a breach of trust, which could mean the father is in the wrong.\n"
