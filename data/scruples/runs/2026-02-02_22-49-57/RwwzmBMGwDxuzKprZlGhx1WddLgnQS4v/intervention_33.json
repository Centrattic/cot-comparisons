When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the father (the author) is in the wrong for giving his son money without his wife's knowledge. The situation involves differing views on spending between the parents and the son.\n\nFirst, the parents let their son live at home during university. The wife is strict about the son's spending, like criticizing him for a $7 meal. The father, however, thinks it's unfair, especially when the wife spends $160 on perfume. He starts giving the son money secretly because he sees the son as responsible.\n\nThe key points here are about financial responsibility and communication. The wife is concerned about the son's spending habits, maybe to teach him budgeting. The father disagrees and wants to support his son financially. But he did this without discussing it with his wife, which could be a problem.\n\nMarriage often requires teamwork in financial decisions. By acting unilaterally, the father might be undermining his wife's role and creating conflict. Even if the son is responsible, the father's actions could lead to trust issues with his wife. The wife might feel disrespected or uninvolved in family decisions, which can strain the marriage.\n\nOn the other hand, the father's intention was to support his son and correct what he saw as unfair treatment. But the method\u2014deceiving his wife\u2014might be the main issue here. The wife's reaction to the perfume purchase versus the son's meal shows a disparity she's trying to address, but the father's secret support could prevent them from discussing their differing values openly.\n\nIn relationships, transparency is crucial. Even if the father's actions seem well-meaning, bypassing his wife's input could be seen as wrong. The right approach might be to have a conversation with his wife about their concerns and find a compromise, rather than acting alone. So, the author is in the wrong for not being honest with his wife, even if his intentions were good.\n"
