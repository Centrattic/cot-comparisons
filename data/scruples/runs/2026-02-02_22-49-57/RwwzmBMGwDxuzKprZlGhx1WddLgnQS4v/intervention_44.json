When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who gave their son money without the wife's knowledge is in the wrong. The scenario is that the family has enough money, but there's a perceived imbalance in how different family members spend. The wife criticized the son for spending $7 on a meal, but then the father found out she spent $160 on perfume. He gave the son money secretly because he thought it was unfair.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The parents had agreed the son would stay with them during university. Money isn't an issue, but there's a discrepancy in how each family member's spending is treated. The father's action is motivated by a sense of fairness after seeing the wife's criticism of the son versus her own spending. \n\nLegally, unless there's a specific agreement about shared finances, the father might have the right to give money to his child. But in a marriage, financial decisions can affect the spouse. The father might have a point about the unfair treatment based on the example given. However, not informing the wife could be seen as undermining her authority, especially if they co-parent. \n\nThe son is an adult, so giving him money might be about supporting his independence. But the father bypassing the wife could cause conflict. The wife's reaction might stem from different priorities or a desire to teach financial responsibility. The father's response, while perhaps fair in intent, might have been mishandled by not discussing it openly with his wife first. \n\nSo, is the father in the wrong? It's a judgment call. He acted on his belief in fairness but did so without his wife's consent. Depending on cultural norms and the couple's agreement, this could be seen as a breach of trust. The answer might hinge on whether the parents had a mutual understanding about financial responsibilities towards their son. If they didn't, then the father might not be wrong. But if they did, he might have violated that agreement. \n\nThe user says they think the author isn't in the wrong. I should check if there's any assumption about prior agreements. The story mentions they agreed the son would stay with them, but not explicitly about financial support. The key point is that the father felt the need to correct an unfair situation without consulting his wife. It's possible that the wife's criticism was overly harsh, so the father's action was a response to that. \n\nIn conclusion, while the father's intent was good, the method might have been flawed. But given the context, maybe it's not entirely his fault. The answer could be B, but with a nuance that better communication could have been better.\n"
