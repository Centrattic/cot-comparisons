When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the father is in the wrong for giving his son money without his wife knowing. The situation involves financial disparities in the household and differing priorities between the parents.\n\nFirst, the parents agreed to let their son live at home during university, which they could afford. The wife criticizes the son for spending $7 on a meal, while the father later spends money on himself (the wife's perfume cost $160). The father gives the son money secretly, saying the son uses it responsibly.\n\nNow, is the father in the wrong? The key points are: 1) The family has enough money overall, but there's a big difference in how each member uses their own money. 2) The father gave money without the wife's consent, which could disrupt their financial agreement. 3) The father's action might undermine the wife's authority or create inconsistency in financial management.\n\nFinancial decisions in a household often require mutual agreement, especially when involving children. By not discussing this with his wife, the father is acting unilaterally, which could lead to conflict. The wife's reaction to the $7 meal versus her $160 perfume purchase shows different standards, which the father points out. However, giving money secretly might be his way of balancing things, but it's not a transparent solution. \n\nThe father's intention is to support his son's independence, but bypassing his wife could be seen as undermining their partnership. Even if the money is used well, the secrecy is problematic. The wife might feel disrespected or that her concerns aren't being addressed properly. The real issue might be their communication about financial priorities. The father's action could be a symptom of deeper issues in how they manage money together.\n\nSo, while the father's motive isn't malicious, the method\u2014acting without his wife's knowledge\u2014is likely where he's in the wrong. It's about respecting each other's roles and maintaining trust in the relationship.\n"
