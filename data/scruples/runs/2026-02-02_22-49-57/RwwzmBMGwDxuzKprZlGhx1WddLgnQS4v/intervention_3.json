When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving their son money without the wife's knowledge. The situation involves a family where the parents agreed to let their son stay at home during university. The main issue seems to be about financial priorities and differing values between the parents.\n\nFirst, the author points out that their wife criticized the son for spending $7 on a meal, but then the author notices the wife spent $160 on perfume. The author feels the criticism is unfair and decides to secretly give the son money. The key here is whether the author's action of giving money without the wife's knowledge is wrong.\n\nI need to consider family dynamics and communication. In a marriage, it's usually important to have mutual agreement on financial decisions, especially when they involve children. The fact that the author didn't inform the wife might be a problem because it could lead to further conflict. Even though the author's intention was to support the son and balance the perceived unfairness, acting without the spouse's knowledge could undermine trust and communication.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning is based on the wife's own spending habits. However, the wife might have different priorities or reasons for her spending. The author's approach bypasses these potential discussions, which might not be the healthiest way to handle the situation. The right approach might have been to discuss the discrepancies in their financial attitudes as a couple first, rather than taking unilateral action.\n\nSo, while the author's intent might be good, the method of handling it without involving the wife is problematic. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because they didn't communicate their decision with their spouse, which is crucial in a marriage.\n"
