When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the dad gave his son money without the wife's knowledge. The wife is upset because she criticized the son for spending $7 on a meal, while she spent $160 on perfume. The dad thinks it's unfair and decided to secretly support his son financially.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The parents are supposed to be a united front in managing family finances. If they're not on the same page, that can cause issues. The dad's action of giving money without the wife's knowledge might be a breach of trust. Even if his intention was to balance the unfairness he perceived, not discussing this with the wife first could be problematic. Financial decisions usually require mutual agreement, especially when it involves giving money to a child, which could affect the household budget or set expectations.\n\nAlso, the wife's reaction to the son spending $7 versus her spending $160 might be part of a larger issue about financial values or priorities. The dad is trying to correct what he sees as her inconsistency, but maybe the real issue is communication between the couple. Instead of secretly giving money, addressing the underlying problem through discussion would be better. The dad's action might be a short-term fix that creates more problems in the long run, like the wife feeling disrespected or the son getting confused about his parents' financial stance.\n\nOn the other hand, the dad might feel that the wife's criticism is unnecessary and wants to support his son. If they are well-off, the $7 isn't a big deal, and the dad is trying to protect his son from harsh criticism. But still, the method of giving money without her knowledge could be seen as undermining her authority and creating a lack of transparency.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author (dad) might be in the wrong for not communicating with his wife first and for acting behind her back. The right approach would be to discuss family financial boundaries and ensure both parents are aligned before making such decisions.\n"
