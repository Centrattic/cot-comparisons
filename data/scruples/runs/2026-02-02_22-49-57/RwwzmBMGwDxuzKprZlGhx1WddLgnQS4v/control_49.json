When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the dad gave his son money without his wife's knowledge. The context is that the family isn't short on money, but there's a big disparity in how each family member spends. The wife criticized the son for spending $7 on a meal, but then the dad found out she spent $160 on perfume. So he starts giving the son money secretly, thinking it's fair.\n\nFirst, the dad and wife had an agreement for the son to stay at home during university. The dad's action of giving money without telling the wife might be a breach of that agreement if they had a prior understanding about financial responsibilities. Even though the family is wealthy, the wife's reaction to the son's spending suggests she has a different view on budgeting or priorities compared to the dad. By giving the son money without her knowing, the dad is creating a secret arrangement that could undermine the wife's authority or their agreed-upon financial plan.\n\nThe dad's intention is to balance the perceived unfairness his wife showed when she criticized the son for $7 but spent $160 herself. However, the solution he chose\u2014bypassing his wife\u2014might not address the root issue. Instead, it creates a double standard where the son gets money without his mother's knowledge, and it could lead to resentment or confusion for the son. The dad should have addressed the discrepancy in their own spending with his wife first, perhaps through a discussion about household financial priorities rather than giving the son money covertly.\n\nAlso, involving the son in a secret financial arrangement might not be the best approach. The son might feel like he's being given money to avoid confrontation between his parents, which isn't healthy. The dad's action could be seen as undermining the wife's role in managing family finances, even if the wife's initial reaction was harsh. The key issue here is the lack of communication and the decision to act behind his wife's back instead of addressing the problem together as a couple.\n\nSo, while the dad's intention might be to correct an unfair situation, his method of doing so without including his wife is problematic. It's important for couples to handle financial matters together, especially when it involves their children. The author is in the wrong because he didn't communicate with his wife and instead took unilateral action, which could create more issues in their relationship and set a bad example for his son.\n"
