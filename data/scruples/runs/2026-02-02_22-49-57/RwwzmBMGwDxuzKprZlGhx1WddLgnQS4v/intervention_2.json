When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for giving their son money without the wife's knowledge. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: The couple agreed to let their son live at home while he goes to university. They're not short on money, but there's a big disparity in how each family member spends. The wife criticizes the son for spending $7 on a meal, but the dad then gives the son money secretly after seeing the wife spend $160 on perfume. The dad's reasoning is that the wife's spending is inconsistent with her criticism of the son's.\n\nHmm. So the dad is trying to level the financial playing field, right? He feels the wife is being unfair by being upset about the son's small expense but okay with her own larger one. By giving the son money, he's essentially trying to compensate for what he sees as the wife's unfairness. But did he handle it the right way?\n\nWell, the main issue here is communication. The dad didn't talk to the wife about his concerns. Instead, he took action behind her back. Even if his intentions were good\u2014to protect his son and address what he saw as unfair treatment\u2014he bypassed the wife. That could be a problem because it undermines trust and joint decision-making in a marriage. Financial matters usually require both partners' input, especially when involving children.\n\nBut then again, the wife's reaction to the son's $7 meal might be disproportionate. If the dad believes that, he should address it with the wife first. Maybe there's a deeper reason why she's upset about the meal. Perhaps she's trying to teach the son about budgeting, or maybe she's not as flush with money as the dad thinks. Without discussing it, the dad assumes she's being unfair, which could be a mistake.\n\nAlso, the dad's action of giving the son money without the wife's knowledge might lead to resentment if the wife finds out. It could create a rift where the wife feels disrespected or that her financial concerns aren't being considered. Even if the dad's intention is to support his son, the method is problematic because it doesn't involve the wife.\n\nOn the flip side, the dad is trying to protect his son from his wife's criticism. If the wife is being overly critical about small expenses, the dad might feel that giving the son money is the only way to prevent conflict. But the proper way would be to have an open discussion about financial expectations and values as a family.\n\nIn summary, while the dad's motivation might be understandable, the approach of acting without the wife's knowledge is likely the wrong move. The issue isn't just about the money given to the son but about how the dad handled the situation within the marriage. The answer would depend on whether the user values open communication and joint decision-making in a marriage. Since the dad didn't communicate, the answer might lean towards A (he is in the wrong). But I need to make sure there's no other angle I'm missing.\n"
