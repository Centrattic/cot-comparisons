When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving their son money without the wife's knowledge.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The parents agreed to let their son stay at home during university. Money isn't an issue overall, but there's a big disparity in how each family member spends. The wife criticized the son for spending $7 on a meal, but then the husband found out she spent $160 on perfume. He got upset and started giving the son money secretly.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the author giving money without consulting his wife. They have a joint household, so financial decisions should be mutual. Even though the wife's reaction to the son's $7 meal seems disproportionate compared to her own $160 perfume purchase, the husband's solution was to bypass his wife and give money to the son without her knowing. That's a problem because it undermines their agreement and could lead to more conflict.\n\nThe husband's action of secretly giving money might be a way to support his son, but it's not honest and could damage the trust between him and his wife. Even if he felt the wife was being unfair, the right approach would be to discuss the financial expectations and boundaries as a couple. By acting alone, he's creating a situation where the wife might feel disrespected or that her input isn't valued. \n\nAdditionally, the son is an adult, but the parents might still have set some guidelines. However, the husband didn't talk to the wife about changing the arrangement, which was originally an agreement. So, even if the wife was being strict about the son's spending, the husband's response was to act behind her back, which isn't constructive. \n\nIn relationships, especially regarding finances, transparency is key. The author's action, while possibly well-intentioned, violates that transparency. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
