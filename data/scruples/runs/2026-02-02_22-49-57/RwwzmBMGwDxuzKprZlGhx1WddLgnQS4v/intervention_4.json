When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving their son money without the wife's knowledge. The scenario is a bit complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the parents agreed to let their son stay at home during university. The husband gives the son money secretly because the wife is critical of the son's spending. The wife spent $160 on perfume, which the husband seems upset about, leading him to give the son more money to balance things out. The son uses the money responsibly, not on drugs or anything, just food and entertainment.\n\nSo, the key points here are the parents' differing attitudes towards spending and the husband's decision to act against his wife's wishes. The wife is strict about the son's $7 meal, while she spends $160 on herself. The husband finds this unfair and tries to correct it by giving the son money. But he does it without the wife's knowledge, which could be a problem.\n\nI need to consider if the husband had the right to do this. Even if the wife's behavior is inconsistent, the husband should have discussed this with her instead of acting behind her back. Secretly giving money might undermine their partnership and the wife's authority. Also, since they are parents, they should ideally be on the same page about financial decisions for their child. The fact that the husband didn't communicate with his wife first could be seen as wrong, regardless of his intentions. Even if the wife's reaction was harsh, the solution should involve communication, not unilateral actions. So, the answer might be A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because he didn't involve his wife in the decision.\n"
