When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves giving their son money without the wife's knowledge. The main points here are about the parents' differing views on spending and the father's actions.\n\nFirst, the parents agreed to let their son stay at home during university. The wife is strict about the son's spending, like getting upset over a $7 meal. The father intervenes, saying he'll talk to the son, but actually reassures him. Then the father notices the wife bought perfume for $160, which he finds unfair. He confronts her, leading to an argument. As a result, the father starts giving the son money secretly.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspect. The father is giving the son money without the wife's knowledge. They are a married couple managing joint finances, so involving each other in such decisions is important. The wife's reaction to the son's spending and the father's reaction to her perfume purchase show a disparity in their values. However, by the father giving money without her knowledge, he's not being transparent, which can lead to trust issues. Even if the money is for the son's benefit, the method of giving it without the wife's consent might be problematic. \n\nThe father's intention is to support the son, but the action undermines the wife's authority and could cause more conflict. Financial decisions in a marriage typically require mutual agreement. So, even if the motive is good, the action is ethically questionable because it's secretive. Therefore, the answer is likely A (yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
