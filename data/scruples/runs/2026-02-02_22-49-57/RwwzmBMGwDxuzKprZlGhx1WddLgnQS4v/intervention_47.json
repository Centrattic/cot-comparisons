When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the father is in the wrong for giving his son money without the wife's knowledge. The situation involves their son going to university nearby and living at home. Money isn't an issue, but there's a big discrepancy in how each family member spends.\n\nFirst, the father mentions that the wife criticized the son for spending $7 on a meal. Then, the father found out the wife spent $160 on perfume. He confronts her, she gets upset, and he starts giving the son money secretly. The user thinks the father isn't in the wrong.\n\nHmm. So the father's action is a response to perceiving unfairness in how the wife is handling expenses. But is that a valid reason? Well, the main question is about the father's actions. Giving money without the spouse's knowledge might be a problem because it's a joint financial decision. Even if they're not poor, the wife might have her own reasons for budgeting or financial control. The father might be undermining her authority by secretly providing funds. Also, the son is an adult, so maybe the parents should agree on how to support him financially. The father's action could be seen as a way to bypass his wife's rules, but that might lead to more conflict. On the other hand, the wife's criticism of the son's spending seems disproportionate, given her own larger purchase. The father's intention was to support his son, but the method might be questionable. So, is he in the wrong? It depends on whether the couple had a mutual agreement on financial matters. If they didn't discuss it and he went behind her back, that's probably not right. Even if the wife's approach was harsh, the solution could have been a conversation, not giving money in secret. So the answer might be A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
