When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for giving their son money without the wife's knowledge.\n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The couple has a son in university living at home. They agreed on this. The dad and mom have different views on spending. The son spent $7 on a meal, and the mom criticized him. The dad defended the son, pointing out that the mom spent $160 on perfume. Then the dad started giving the son money secretly because he feels the mom is being unfair with the son's spending.\n\nSo, the key points here are about money management in the household and the dad's actions. The main issue is whether giving money without the wife's knowledge is wrong.\n\nIn many relationships, finances are a joint matter. If both parents are contributing to the household and making financial decisions together, one parent giving money to a child without the other's knowledge might be considered a breach of trust or agreement. The dad is trying to counterbalance what he perceives as the wife's unfair criticism, but by doing it secretly, he's not involving her in the decision.\n\nAlso, the son is an adult and a university student. Depending on the age and independence, it might be reasonable for him to have some financial freedom. However, the parents might have agreed on a certain way to support him, perhaps through allowances or covering expenses. If the dad is providing additional money outside of that agreement, it could create tension between the parents.\n\nAnother angle is the mom's reaction. She's upset about the $7 meal. Maybe she has different financial priorities or values. The dad's response was to give the son more money, which might not address the root issue of their differing views on spending. The dad's action might be seen as undermining the wife's authority or the household's financial arrangements.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the dad is supporting his son's independence and recognizing the unfair criticism. But the method\u2014without the wife's knowledge\u2014could be problematic. Transparency is important in a marriage, especially when it comes to managing family finances. The dad's actions could lead to more conflict if the wife finds out, as it shows a lack of communication and mutual decision-making.\n\nSo, considering all this, the dad's action of giving money without the wife's knowledge might be in the wrong because it violates the trust and mutual agreement needed in a partnership. Even if his intentions were good, the method was secretive and could cause more harm. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
