When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the father is in the wrong for giving his son money without his wife's knowledge. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the parents agreed to let their son live at home during university. The son is spending $7 on a meal, and the wife is upset about that. The father, after being told about this, talks to his son and then later confronts the wife about her spending $160 on perfume. The father then starts giving the son money secretly.\n\nThe key points here are about fairness in spending and communication between spouses. The wife criticizes the son for a small expense, while the father points out her own higher expense. This suggests that the wife's reaction might be seen as inconsistent. The father's response was to secretly support the son financially, which the wife wasn't aware of.\n\nNow, the question is whether the father is wrong. From a relationship perspective, giving money to a son without the spouse's knowledge could be problematic. Couples typically share financial responsibilities, so not discussing this with the wife might breach trust. Even if the parents agree on letting the son live at home, the father's decision to provide additional funds secretly could be seen as undermining their financial partnership.\n\nHowever, the father's motivation was to address what he saw as unfair treatment. The wife's criticism of the son's $7 meal versus her own $160 perfume purchase seems like a double standard. The father might feel that supporting his son is necessary to prevent such conflicts.\n\nBut the main issue here is the lack of communication. Even if the father's intent was good, not involving his wife in the decision to give the son money could be wrong. It's possible that the wife would have agreed to it once the situation was explained, but the secrecy might have caused more harm than good. Trust and transparency are crucial in a marriage, so acting without the spouse's knowledge can be problematic regardless of the motive.\n\nSo, while there's a valid point about the wife's inconsistency, the father's approach of acting behind her back without discussion is likely the wrong move. It's important to address financial disagreements openly rather than making unilateral decisions that affect shared resources.\n"
