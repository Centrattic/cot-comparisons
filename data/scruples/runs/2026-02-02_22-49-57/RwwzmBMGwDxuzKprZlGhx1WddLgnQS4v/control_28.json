When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the father is in the wrong for giving his son money without his wife's knowledge. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The family isn't short on money overall, but there's a big disparity in how each member uses their funds. The wife criticized the son for spending $7 on a meal, but then the father found out she spent $160 on perfume. He confronts her, and she gets upset. In response, he starts giving the son money secretly.\n\nThe main issue here seems to be the lack of communication and the secret action. Even though the father might think he's balancing things out, giving money without the wife's knowledge could undermine their partnership. Couples usually handle finances together, especially when it comes to their children. The father's action might be seen as taking sides, which can cause more conflict.\n\nAlso, the wife's reaction to the son's spending versus her own perfume purchase shows different standards. The father's response to her criticism was valid, but his solution\u2014secretly giving money to the son\u2014might not be the best approach. Open discussion about financial priorities and boundaries would be healthier. The father's secrecy could lead to more trust issues.\n\nSo, even if his intentions are good, the method is questionable. The answer is likely A, the father is in the wrong for not communicating with his wife first.\n"
