When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the father is in the wrong for giving his son money without his wife's knowledge. The situation involves differing views on spending between the wife and the son. \n\nFirst, the family isn't struggling financially, but there's a big difference in how each member spends. The son spent $7 on a meal, and the wife criticized him. Then the father found out the wife spent $160 on perfume, which made him upset. He then started giving his son money secretly.\n\nNow, the key points here are about family dynamics and communication. The father's action of giving money without the wife knowing could be seen as undermining her. Even if he thought he was being fair, not discussing it with her first might cause tension. The wife might feel disrespected or excluded from decisions involving the children's finances. \n\nOn the other hand, the father might feel his wife is being overly critical of his son's spending while she spends more. But the way he handled it\u2014secretly giving money\u2014could lead to more conflict. Open communication would have been better. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Probably yes. Even if the intention was good, not talking to his wife first shows a lack of respect for her role in managing the household finances. The right approach would have been to discuss their differing spending habits and reach an agreement, rather than acting unilaterally.\n"
