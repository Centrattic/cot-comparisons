When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who gave their son money without the wife's knowledge is in the wrong. So, the scenario is that the parents agreed to let their son live at home during university. The father notices the wife is critical of the son spending $7 on a meal but she spends $160 on perfume. He talks to the son, then starts giving the son money secretly. The user thinks the father isn't wrong, but wants to know the community's take.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. Communication is a big factor here. The father gave money without the wife knowing, which could be seen as undermining her. Even if the wife's reaction to the son's $7 meal seems excessive compared to her $160 perfume, the father's response was to bypass her and give money directly. That might not address the underlying issue of their financial communication problems. \n\nThe wife's criticism of the son might be due to different spending priorities or maybe she's trying to teach him budgeting. The father's action could be seen as enabling the son and not supporting the wife in setting boundaries. Even though the family has enough money, the secrecy of the father's action could cause resentment. The father should have discussed the discrepancy with his wife instead of acting alone. So, maybe the answer is A (in the wrong) because he didn't communicate properly and took matters into his own hands. But there's also the aspect of fairness in spending. However, the method he used (without the wife's knowledge) is problematic. So I think the answer is A.\n"
