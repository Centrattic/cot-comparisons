When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for giving their son money without their wife's knowledge. The story mentions that the parents agreed to let their son live at home during university. The father is giving the son money secretly because he notices the mother is being strict about the son's spending, like being upset over a $7 meal, while she spends $160 on perfume. The father thinks he's helping by providing money so the son can manage his expenses without the mother's criticism.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The main issue is whether the father's action of giving money without the wife's knowledge is wrong. The father's intention is to balance what he perceives as unfair spending criticism from the wife. The son is mature and uses the money responsibly. The parents have enough money overall, but there's a disparity in how each family member's spending is treated.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics: the parents are married, so financial decisions usually require mutual agreement. By not involving his wife, the father might be undermining her authority or creating a secret system. Even if the father's intent is good, keeping it a secret could lead to mistrust. However, the wife's reaction to the son's small expense versus her own larger purchase seems disproportionate, which the father is trying to correct.\n\nBut the father's approach is problematic. He's not addressing the underlying issue with his wife directly but instead circumventing her by giving the son money. This could lead to more conflict if the wife finds out, as she might feel disrespected or that her concerns are being ignored. The father should have discussed with his wife about setting a reasonable allowance or budget for the son, rather than handling it behind her back.\n\nOn the other hand, the father's action might be seen as a way to protect his son from unnecessary criticism and provide financial support. The son is using the money responsibly, so the outcome is positive. However, the method\u2014without the wife's knowledge\u2014could be ethically questionable in a marriage where joint financial decisions are expected.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the father's intentions are good, but the method is flawed. The answer depends on whether the secrecy is the main issue. Since the parents are a team, keeping financial matters secret could be wrong regardless of the intent. Therefore, the father is in the wrong for not communicating with his wife about this arrangement, even if the action itself benefits the son.\n"
