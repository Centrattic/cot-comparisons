When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who gave their son money without the wife's knowledge is in the wrong. The scenario is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the couple agreed to let their son live at home during university. The father notices that there's a discrepancy in how money is being spent. The wife is upset with the son for spending $7 on a meal, while she spends $160 on a perfume. The father talks to the son about it but then starts giving the son money secretly.\n\nHmm, so the main issue here is the father giving money without the wife's knowledge. The user thinks the father isn't wrong, but I need to evaluate based on the details.\n\nThe family isn't struggling financially, so the money shouldn't be an issue. However, the father is trying to address what he perceives as unfair treatment by the wife. But by giving the son money without informing the wife, he's bypassing her. That could be seen as undermining her authority or not being open in the relationship. Even if his intentions are good, secrecy can cause problems in a marriage. The wife might feel that her input is disregarded, especially since they had agreements about the son's living arrangements and finances.\n\nOn the other hand, the father is trying to support his son's independence and correct a perceived imbalance. The wife's reaction to the $7 meal might be overly harsh compared to her own spending. But the father's solution of giving money without discussing it with his wife could lead to more conflict. It's possible that a better approach would be to address the issue with the wife first, rather than acting unilaterally.\n\nSo, while the father's intentions might be good, the act of keeping it a secret from his wife is problematic. Relationships require communication and mutual agreement, even about money matters. By not including his wife, he's creating a situation where trust could be an issue. Therefore, the father might be in the wrong because he didn't communicate the plan with his wife, even if the underlying issue is valid.\n"
