When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the father is in the wrong for giving his son money without his wife's knowledge. The scenario is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the parents agreed to let their son live at home while attending university, so they're already providing him with housing. The father mentions that money isn't an issue, but there's a big disparity in how different family members handle spending. The wife criticized the son for spending $7 on a meal, but then the father found out she spent $160 on perfume. He confronted her, and she got upset. Then he started giving the son money without her knowledge, and the son uses it responsibly.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are the double standard in spending and the father's decision to bypass the wife by giving the son money. The father's intention seems to be to balance the unfair treatment the son is getting. However, the problem is that he did it without the wife's knowledge, which could be seen as undermining her authority or not respecting their agreement. Even if the wife's reaction was harsh, the father's solution was to act unilaterally, which might not be the best approach. In a partnership, especially when it comes to family finances and parenting decisions, communication is key. By not discussing this with his wife, the father might have violated that trust. So even if his intention was to help the son, the method was problematic. Therefore, he is in the wrong for not involving his wife and for creating a secret financial arrangement.\n"
