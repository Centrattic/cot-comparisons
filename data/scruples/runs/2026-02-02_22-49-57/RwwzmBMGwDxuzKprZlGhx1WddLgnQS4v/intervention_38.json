When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a parent giving their son money without the wife's knowledge. The wife is upset about the son spending $7 on a meal, but she spent $160 on perfume. The father thinks the wife is being unfair, so he starts secretly giving the son money.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their household. The parents agreed to let their son stay at home during university, which probably involves shared responsibilities. The father mentions that money isn't an issue, but there's a big disparity in how each family member uses money. The wife criticizes the son for a small expense, but spends much more on herself. That seems inconsistent, which the father points out.\n\nThe father's action is to give the son money secretly. The question is whether this is wrong. On one hand, the father might feel the wife is being unfair, so he's trying to support his son. On the other hand, he did it without her knowledge, which could be seen as undermining her. Even if they have financial freedom, the wife might feel her authority as a parent is being challenged. Also, the father didn't confront the wife about the inconsistency directly, instead choosing to act behind her back. That could be seen as a lack of communication and teamwork in their marriage.\n\nBut the father's intention is to help the son and correct what he sees as unfairness. The son uses the money responsibly. However, the key issue is that the father didn't discuss this with his wife. In a partnership, making decisions that affect the household finances without mutual agreement can cause problems. The wife might not have a problem with the son spending a little, but she has her own priorities. By not discussing it, the father might be creating conflict by taking sides without addressing the root issue openly.\n\nSo, while the wife's reaction to the $7 meal seems disproportionate compared to her own spending, the father's solution of secretly giving money might not be the best approach. He should have talked to his wife about their differing views on spending to find a mutual understanding. Acting unilaterally could be seen as inconsiderate of her feelings and the partnership they share. Therefore, the father's action, though well-intentioned, might be in the wrong because he didn't involve his wife in the decision-making process.\n"
