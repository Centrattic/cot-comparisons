When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the father is in the wrong for giving his son money without his wife's knowledge. \n\nFirst, the setup: The son is at university but lives at home. The parents agreed to this arrangement. The family has enough money, but there's a big disparity in how each member uses it. The wife criticizes the son for spending $7 on a meal, but then the father notices she spent $160 on perfume. The father gives the son money secretly to help him feel more financially equal.\n\nThe father's actions might be seen as trying to correct what he perceives as unfair treatment by the wife. He's giving the son money to give him more freedom in spending, based on his own judgment. However, the key point here is whether he acted against the wife's knowledge. Since they're a couple, financial decisions are typically mutual, especially when a child is involved. By not involving the wife, he might have undermined her and created a situation where she's unaware of the son's additional funds. This could lead to future conflicts or misunderstandings about how family finances are managed. The wife might feel disrespected or that her concerns are being dismissed. \n\nOn the other hand, the father's intention was to support his son and address what he saw as unfair criticism. He's not using the money for harmful purposes, which is a good point. But the method of doing it without informing his spouse is questionable. Financial transparency is important in a marriage, especially when it involves a child's expenses. The father's action might be seen as a breach of trust, even if his motives were good.\n\nSo, the question is whether the father's good intentions justify acting without his wife's knowledge. The answer likely leans towards \"Yes,\" the father is in the wrong because he didn't communicate his decision with his spouse, which is a fundamental aspect of a partnership. Even if the wife's criticism was excessive, the solution should involve discussion and agreement between both parents, not unilateral action that could create more issues.\n"
