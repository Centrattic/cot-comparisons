When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for giving their son money without their wife's knowledge. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the family has enough money, but there's a big difference in how each member spends. The son spent $7 on a meal, and the wife criticized him. Then the husband found out the wife spent $160 on perfume, which made him upset. He talked to his son about the $7, but when he saw the perfume, he confronted the wife. This led to tension, and then he started giving the son money secretly.\n\nNow, the key points here are about fairness and communication. The husband thinks it's unfair that the wife is upset about the son's small expense but not about her own much larger one. He gave the son money to maybe even things out, but without the wife knowing, which she might not have agreed to.\n\nIs the husband in the wrong? Well, he's giving money secretly, which could undermine trust in the marriage. Even if his intention was to be fair, bypassing his wife's knowledge might be a problem. Also, the wife's reaction to the son's spending versus her own might be a separate issue, but the husband's solution (secretly funding the son) could be seen as meddling without addressing the root problem through communication. So, maybe he's wrong because he didn't talk to his wife first and acted behind her back. But some might argue he's trying to support his son. But the main issue is the secrecy and not addressing the spending disparities through dialogue. So the answer is likely A.\n"
