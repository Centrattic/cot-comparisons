When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for giving their son money without the wife's knowledge. The situation involves financial dynamics in the family.\n\nFirst, the parents agreed to let their son stay at home during university. The father notices a discrepancy in how money is spent: the wife criticizes the son for a $7 meal but buys a $160 perfume without issue. The father then starts giving the son money secretly to cover such expenses, as the son uses it responsibly.\n\nSo, the question is whether the father is in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFrom a communication standpoint, the father didn't discuss this with his wife, which might be a problem. Even if he's trying to support his son, doing so without her knowledge could undermine their financial agreement. The wife's reaction to the son's spending might be based on her own priorities or budgeting, which the father didn't consider. By giving money without her consent, the father could be creating a rift or financial mismanagement between them. \n\nHowever, the father's intention is to help the son, who's in a transition phase. The son is using the money responsibly, so maybe the father is trying to correct an unfair perception. But the key issue here is the lack of communication between the parents. Financial decisions, especially involving their child, usually require mutual agreement. The father's action might be seen as bypassing the wife's input, which is a partnership issue. \n\nSo, the father's action is problematic because he didn't talk to his wife first. Even if the wife's criticism was unfair, the right approach would be to address that with her and possibly adjust their household's spending habits together, rather than acting unilaterally. Therefore, the father is in the wrong for not involving his wife in the decision.\n"
