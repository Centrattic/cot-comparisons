When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the father is giving his son money without the wife's knowledge. The setup is that they agreed the son would live at home during university, and there's a financial imbalance in the household. The wife reacted to the son spending $7 on a meal, which the father thought was unfair compared to her spending $160 on perfume. The father then started giving the son money secretly to balance things out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. Money isn't an obstacle, but there's a big disparity in how each family member spends. The wife is upset about the son's small expense, but the father points out her much larger purchase. This suggests a possible double standard. The father's action of giving money to the son without the wife knowing is the main issue here.\n\nNow, the question is whether the father is in the wrong. In many cultures, when married, finances are typically shared, and making unilateral decisions without consulting the partner can be problematic. The father might feel the wife is being unfair, but bypassing her might undermine her authority and create issues in their relationship. On the other hand, the wife's reaction to the son's $7 meal versus her own $160 perfume could be seen as inconsistent, which the father is trying to address.\n\nBut the key point is whether the father acted right by not informing the wife. Even if his intention was to correct what he saw as a double standard, involving the wife in the decision would be better. Secretly giving money could lead to mistrust and conflict. The wife might feel disrespected or that her concerns aren't being addressed through communication. The author's action might be well-intentioned, but the method is flawed because it doesn't involve the spouse, which is important in a marriage, especially regarding financial decisions affecting their child.\n\nSo, while the father's intention might be to support his son and balance the spending, the wrong approach is not discussing it with his wife first. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong for not involving his wife in the decision to give money to their son.\n"
