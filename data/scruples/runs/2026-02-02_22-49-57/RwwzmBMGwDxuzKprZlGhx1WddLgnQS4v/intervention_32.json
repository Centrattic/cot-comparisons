When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for giving their son money without the wife's knowledge.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The parents agreed to let their son live at home during university. Money isn't a problem in the household, but there's a big disparity in how each family member spends. The wife criticized the son for spending $7 on a meal, but bought perfume for $160. The father then started giving the son money secretly.\n\nSo, the key points here are the parents' differing views on spending and the father's decision to bypass the wife. The father feels the wife is being unfair by criticizing the son for a small expense while spending a lot on herself. He gives money to his son to help him without the wife knowing, probably to avoid the wife's criticism.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, giving money without the spouse's knowledge could be seen as a breach of trust. Even if the father's intention is good, not involving the wife might create issues. The wife might feel disrespected or that her concerns aren't being addressed. It's possible that the father didn't communicate his actions because he didn't want to confront the wife about her spending habits, but secrecy can lead to bigger problems.\n\nOn the other hand, the father's action might be motivated by wanting to support his son fairly. The wife's criticism of a $7 expense versus her own $160 purchase seems hypocritical, which the father correctly points out. However, the solution of giving money without discussing it with the wife might not be the best approach. Instead, addressing the discrepancy in their spending habits as a couple might be more constructive.\n\nThe question is whether the father is in the wrong. If we consider that he's helping his son in a way that the wife isn't, it's a point in his favor. But the act of not involving the wife could strain their relationship. It's a balance between supporting the son and maintaining marital trust.\n\nIn many relationships, making financial decisions without the partner can be problematic. Even if the wife is being unfair, the father should address the issue with her rather than acting alone. The secrecy might be the main issue here. So, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because he didn't communicate with his wife about the problem and chose to act behind her back instead of discussing it openly.\n"
