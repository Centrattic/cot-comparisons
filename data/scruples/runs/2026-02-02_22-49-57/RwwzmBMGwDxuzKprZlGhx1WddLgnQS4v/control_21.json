When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for giving their son money without the wife's knowledge. The story says that the family isn't short on money, but there's a big disparity in how family members spend. The wife criticized the son for spending $7 on a meal, while she bought a $160 perfume. The father then started giving the son money secretly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The parents had agreed to have the son live at home during university. The father felt the wife was being overly critical, so he decided to support the son financially without her knowing. The key points are the secrecy and the financial disparity.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the father might be protecting his son from his wife's criticism, which could be seen as unfair. However, giving money without the spouse's knowledge might undermine the wife's authority and could lead to trust issues. Even if the wife's critique of the $7 meal seems excessive, the father's decision to bypass her could be problematic. \n\nFinancial decisions in a marriage usually require mutual agreement. By acting behind her back, the father might be contributing to marital tension. Even if the wife's reaction to the $7 was unreasonable, the father's approach of giving money secretly might not address the underlying issue and could worsen the conflict. \n\nAlso, the father's action might be seen as taking sides in a family dispute, which can create more problems. The wife might feel disrespected or that her concerns aren't taken seriously. The father's justification is about fairness, but his method could be considered wrong because it doesn't involve open communication with his wife.\n\nSo, while the wife's behavior might be unreasonable, the father's secret support of the son could be seen as the wrong action because it's done without transparency in the marriage. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
