When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for giving their son money without the wife's knowledge. The story says that the couple agreed to let their son stay at home during university, and the wife is upset about the son spending $7 on a meal, while she herself spent $160 on perfume. The father gave the son money secretly because he felt the wife's criticism was unfair.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They have enough money, so it's not about financial hardship. The main issue is the perception of fairness. The wife criticizes the son for a small expense, but the father notices she spent a much larger amount and confronts her. Then the father starts giving the son money without her knowing. \n\nThe user thinks the author (the father) isn't in the wrong. I need to evaluate if that's the case. In terms of family dynamics, communication is key. The father and wife had an agreement about the son staying home, but did they discuss how expenses would be handled? The father's action of giving money without her knowledge might be seen as undermining her authority or not respecting her input in managing the household finances. Even if the father believes the wife is being unfair, bypassing her in financial matters could lead to conflict. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife's reaction to the $7 meal seems excessive compared to her own $160 perfume. The father might see it as hypocrisy and want to protect his son from what he perceives as unreasonable criticism. But the method of giving money without her knowledge could be problematic. The father should have addressed the issue with the wife first, maybe tried to understand her perspective or negotiate a better approach. \n\nThe son is a mature adult using the money responsibly, so maybe the father's intention is good. However, in a marriage, sharing financial decisions is usually important. The father's secrecy might be seen as a breach of trust. The wife might feel disrespected or that the father is taking sides without discussing it properly. \n\nSo, even if the father's intention is to correct an imbalance, the lack of communication with his wife is a problem. It's about how the action was taken rather than just the action itself. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because he didn't communicate with his wife before making financial decisions that affect the household.\n"
