When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the dad is in the wrong for giving his son money without his wife's knowledge.\n\nFirst, let's look at the situation. The parents agreed to let their son live at home while he's in university because it's close. The family is well-off financially, but there's an issue with how money is being managed. The wife is upset when the son spends $7 on a meal, but the dad later finds out she spent $160 on perfume. That seems like a discrepancy in how they're handling money. The dad then starts giving his son money secretly because he thinks the wife is being unfair.\n\nNow, the key points here. The parents are a family unit, and financial decisions usually require mutual agreement, especially if they're sharing resources. The wife is criticizing the son for a small expense, but the dad is giving him money to counterbalance that. However, by not informing the wife, the dad is breaking the trust between them. Even if the wife's reaction seems disproportionate, the dad's solution is to bypass her, which is a problem. \n\nAlso, the son is an adult, and giving him money might be a way to support him independently, but the method of doing so without the spouse's knowledge could be problematic. The dad's actions might be seen as taking sides and not addressing the underlying issue of financial management within the household. Instead of resolving the conflict openly, he's creating a covert arrangement. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the dad's intent might be to help his son, but the approach undermines the couple's agreement and could lead to more issues. The wife's reaction to the perfume versus the meal might be a red flag for the dad to address with her in a conversation, not to take matters into his own hands. \n\nSo, the dad is in the wrong because he didn't communicate with his wife and acted unilaterally, which could harm the family's financial unity and trust.\n"
