When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the father is in the wrong for giving his son money without his wife's knowledge. \n\nFirst, the context: The family isn't struggling financially, but there's a big disparity in how each member spends. The wife criticized the son for a $7 meal, but then the father found out she spent $160 on perfume. This inconsistency made him upset. To address what he sees as unfair treatment, he started secretly giving money to his son.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The father and wife had an agreement for the son to stay at home during university. The wife's behavior seems hypocritical\u2014scolding the son for a small expense while spending significantly more herself. The father's action was to level the playing field, supporting his son without the wife's approval. \n\nBut the key here is the method. The father went behind his wife's back. Even if his intent was noble, not discussing this with her first might have been a misstep. Communication is crucial in relationships, especially when making decisions that affect the household's finances. By acting without her knowledge, he might have undermined her authority or the agreed-upon financial discussions.\n\nHowever, the wife's reaction to the son's expense seems overly critical, which could be contributing to a stressful home environment. The father's intervention might be his way of protecting his son. But the secrecy is the main issue here. Instead of secretly providing funds, he should have addressed the wife's spending habits directly with her, perhaps discussing the fairness of their approach to the children's expenses versus her own.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the father's intention wasn't malicious, but the method was flawed. The wife isn't wrong in her initial concern if she's managing the household finances and wants to instill financial responsibility. However, her hypocrisy in spending more on herself while criticizing the son could be a problem she needs to address herself.\n\nSo, the father's action was a reaction to perceived unfairness, but bypassing his wife's knowledge sets a precedent for not discussing financial matters together. This could lead to more issues down the line. Therefore, while his actions were well-intentioned, the method was wrong. Hence, the answer would be A\u2014Yes, he is in the wrong for not communicating with his wife first.\n"
