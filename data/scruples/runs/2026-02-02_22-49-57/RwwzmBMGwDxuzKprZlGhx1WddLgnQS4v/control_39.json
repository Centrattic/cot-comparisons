When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving their son money without the wife's knowledge. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the couple agreed to let their son stay at home while he's at university. Money isn't a problem for the household overall, but there's a big disparity in how each family member manages their money. The wife criticized the son for spending $7 on a meal, but then the husband found out she spent $160 on perfume. The husband then started giving the son money secretly.\n\nSo, the key points here are the financial disparity and the secrecy. The husband feels his wife is being inconsistent with the son's spending, so he gives the son money without her knowing. The wife is upset about this.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, giving money without the spouse's knowledge could be seen as undermining their authority, especially since they were both supposed to be handling the son's living situation together. Even if the wife's criticism seems unfair, the husband's response was to act behind her back rather than address the issue openly. That could lead to more conflict and mistrust.\n\nAlso, the husband's motivation was to balance the perceived unfairness, but the method (secrecy) is problematic. It's possible that discussing the issue with his wife instead of acting alone would have been a better approach. The wife's reaction to the perfume price versus the son's meal might be a point of contention, but the husband's solution might not address the root of the problem. Additionally, the son is an adult now, so managing his own money is part of his independence, but the parents are co-responsibles for his living situation. The husband's action could be seen as taking sides, which might create tension in the marriage.\n\nIn many relationships, major financial decisions require both partners' agreement. Even if the money isn't scarce, the principle of transparency is important. The husband's secrecy might be the main issue here. Therefore, the answer might be A, but I need to consider if there's any justification for his actions. However, the secrecy and lack of communication are likely the main problems. So, the author is in the wrong because he acted without transparency, which is a breach of trust in a relationship. So the answer is A.\n"
