When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the father is in the wrong for giving his son money without his wife's knowledge. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the setup: the couple has enough money, but there's a disparity in how each family member uses it. The son spends $7 on a meal, which the wife criticizes. Then the wife buys a $160 perfume, which the father reacts to by closing the kitchen door and confronting her. The father then starts giving the son money secretly, saying he uses it responsibly.\n\nSo, the key points here are about fairness and communication. The father is trying to balance what he sees as his wife's inconsistency in spending. But by giving the son money without telling the wife, he's not being transparent. Even if the wife's reaction to the son was harsh, the father's solution is to bypass her, which might not address the underlying issue.\n\nThe wife's criticism of the son's $7 meal versus her own $160 purchase could be a point of contention. The father thinks it's unfair, but maybe the wife is managing the household budget and the son is supposed to learn responsibility. By giving the son money without the wife's knowledge, the father might be undermining her authority in financial matters. This could lead to more conflict, especially if the wife feels disrespected or if the son becomes dependent on the secret money.\n\nAlso, the father's approach of not involving the wife in decisions about the son's finances could be problematic. They might need to communicate better as a couple about their expectations regarding their son's expenses during university. Secretly giving money might not be the best way to handle perceived unfairness; instead, they might need to discuss and agree on a unified approach.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the father's action is a response to his wife's behavior, but it's a unilateral decision. The wife's purchase is her personal spending, while the son's expenses might be part of the household budget. The father's intervention could be seen as a way to support the son, but it's done without considering the wife's perspective or their mutual agreement on how to handle their son's university expenses.\n\nSo, the father's actions might be well-intentioned but lack transparency and mutual decision-making, which is important in a marriage. Therefore, he could be in the wrong because he's not addressing the issue openly with his wife but rather taking matters into his own hands, which could lead to further conflict and disrespect in the relationship.\n"
