When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the father is in the wrong for giving his son money without his wife's knowledge. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the parents agreed to let their son live at home during university. Money isn't an issue overall, but there's a big disparity in how each family member spends. The wife criticized the son for spending $7 on a meal, but then the father found out she spent $160 on perfume. The father then started giving the son money secretly, saying it's because the son uses it responsibly.\n\nSo, the main points here are the double standard in spending and the father's decision to bypass his wife. The father probably felt the wife was being unfair to the son, so he tried to help. But giving money without the spouse's knowledge could be problematic. Marital trust is important; if one partner starts making financial decisions without the other, that can lead to issues. Even if the wife was being unreasonable about the $7, the father's solution was to act behind her back, which might not be the right approach. He should have addressed the double standard directly with her instead of secretly supporting the son. The son might not be in the wrong for spending $7, but the father's secrecy is the main issue here. So, the answer is likely A because he's undermining his wife and not communicating properly.\n"
