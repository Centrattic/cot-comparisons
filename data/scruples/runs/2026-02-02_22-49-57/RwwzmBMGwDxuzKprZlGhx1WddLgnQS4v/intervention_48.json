When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the father is in the wrong for giving his son money without his wife's knowledge. The situation involves the parents having a disagreement over their son's spending. The wife criticizes the son for spending $7 on a meal, while the father gives him money to use freely, and he also points out that the wife spent $160 on perfume. Now, the father started giving the son money secretly.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The parents agreed to let the son live at home during university. The wife is upset about the $7 meal, but the father is upset that she spent $160 on perfume. The father then gives the son money without the wife knowing, to help him without the wife's criticism.\n\nThe question is about whether the father is in the wrong. Let's consider the dynamics here. The father's action is a direct response to the wife's perceived double standard. He's trying to support his son financially to avoid the wife's criticism. However, giving money without the spouse's knowledge could be seen as undermining the wife's authority or not being transparent in the relationship. \n\nFinancial decisions in a marriage often require mutual agreement, even if they're about a child. By not involving his wife, the father might be acting out of frustration, but it's possible he's causing further tension. The wife's criticism might be excessive, but that doesn't necessarily justify the father's secretive action. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife's behavior could be seen as unreasonable, given the amount spent on perfume versus the son's meal. But the father's solution is to bypass her, which might not address the root issue, which is communication and differing values about money. \n\nThe father's intention is to support his son, which is positive, but the method of doing so without the wife's knowledge could be problematic. The key issue here is the lack of communication and joint decision-making in their financial matters. \n\nIn many relationships, financial transparency is important. By acting alone, the father may be causing more harm by creating a secret arrangement. The wife might feel disrespected, and this could lead to more conflict. Even if the father's motives are good, the method is questionable. \n\nHowever, if the wife is being overly critical and the father is trying to protect his son from unnecessary stress, there's a case for understanding his perspective. But ethically, he should probably discuss this with his wife first, even if there's disagreement. \n\nSo, considering all that, the father's action might be seen as wrong because he's not being transparent with his wife, even if his intentions are good. The right approach would be to address the spending habits as a couple, not to secretly fund the son. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
