When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a parent giving their son money without the wife's knowledge, and there's some tension about spending habits.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The parents agreed to let their son live at home during university. The son uses a debit card, and the wife criticized him for spending $7 on a meal. The dad then gives the son money secretly, which seems to be a reaction to the wife's behavior. The dad points out that the wife spent $160 on perfume, which he found unfair. The son is responsible with the money, spending on food and other reasonable things.\n\nNow, the question is whether the dad is wrong. The user thinks he's not in the wrong. Let me consider possible angles. \n\nOn one hand, the dad went behind the wife's back. That could be seen as undermining her, especially since they had an agreement. Even if the wife's criticism was harsh, the dad's solution was to bypass her, which might not be the best approach. Secrets in relationships can lead to more problems. Also, the dad didn't address the issue directly with the wife; instead, he took action that could be seen as enabling the son or showing favoritism.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's reaction to the $7 meal seems disproportionate compared to her own spending. The dad might feel that the son is being unfairly treated, especially since they have enough money. The dad's intention was to support the son, and the son is responsible. The dad's actions could be seen as trying to balance the family's financial expectations.\n\nBut the main issue is whether the dad is in the wrong. Even if the wife's behavior was wrong, the dad's response was secret. In a marriage, major decisions, like giving children money, especially when the spouse is involved, should be discussed. By not talking to his wife, the dad created a situation where the wife might feel disrespected or that her concerns aren't being heard. Even if the dad's intent was good, the method might be problematic.\n\nAnother angle: maybe the dad is trying to protect the son from the wife's criticism, but handling it secretly isn't the healthiest approach. They should address the underlying issue of how each family member is treated financially as a couple. The dad's action could lead to more conflict if the wife finds out, or if the son feels he should support himself.\n\nSo, considering all that, even if the wife is being unfair, the dad's decision to act without her knowledge could be seen as wrong because it didn't involve her and might exacerbate the problem. The right approach would be to talk to the wife about the discrepancy and find a mutual agreement. Therefore, the answer might be A (yes, in the wrong).\n"
