When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this scenario is in the wrong for giving their son money without the wife's knowledge. The story is about a family where the parents agreed to let their son live at home during university. The father feels there's a discrepancy in how money is spent because the wife criticized the son for $7 on a meal but bought a $160 perfume. The father then started secretly giving the son money to help him out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The main issue is the father giving money without the wife's knowledge. The wife is upset about the son's small expense but spends more on herself, which the father finds unfair. The father's actions are meant to support the son, but the secrecy is the main point of contention.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, the father is trying to address what he perceives as unfair treatment by the wife. He's providing support to his son, which seems reasonable given their financial situation. However, the secrecy aspect is problematic. Couples typically share financial decisions, especially when it involves their children. By not informing the wife, he's undermining her in the parent-child dynamic and could cause more conflict.\n\nAlso, the wife's reaction to the son's $7 meal versus her own $160 perfume might indicate different priorities, but that doesn't justify the father acting unilaterally. The father's approach might lead to further resentment if the wife feels excluded from the decision-making. It's possible that open communication could have resolved the issue instead of resorting to secrecy.\n\nSo, while the father's intentions are good, the method of handling the situation without involving the wife is likely where he's in the wrong. The decision to give money to the son should ideally be mutual between both parents, especially since they had an agreement about the son living at home. The father's actions might be seen as overstepping, even if well-intentioned.\n"
