When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is a father who's giving his son money without his wife's knowledge. The context is that they both agreed to let their son live at home during university. The family isn't short on money, but there's a big disparity in how each member spends. The wife criticizes the son for spending $7 on a meal, but the author notices she spent $160 on perfume. The author then starts giving the son money secretly.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about fairness and communication. The wife is upset about the son's spending, which the author thinks is hypocritical because she spent much more. The author's response was to give the son money without telling the wife. \n\nFirst, giving money without the spouse's knowledge might be an issue because they're a team in managing finances. Even if the wife's behavior was unfair, the author didn't address it with her directly. Instead, he took action behind her back. That could be seen as undermining her and not working through the issue together.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the son is mature and spends the money responsibly. But the main problem here is the lack of communication between the parents. The author didn't confront his wife about the hypocrisy in a constructive way. Instead, he bypassed her by giving the son money, which could lead to more conflict.\n\nThe wife might feel that the author is taking sides without discussing the matter as a couple. Financial decisions usually require mutual agreement. By acting unilaterally, the author might be creating more problems than solving. \n\nSo, even though the wife's reaction to the son's spending was unreasonable, the author's method of addressing it by secretly giving money isn't the right approach. The right step would have been to talk to his wife about the discrepancy in their values and expectations regarding spending. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because he didn't handle the situation by communicating with his wife first and instead acted behind her back. The answer should be A.\n"
