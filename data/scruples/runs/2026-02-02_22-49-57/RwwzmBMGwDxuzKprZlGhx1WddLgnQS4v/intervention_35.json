When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the dad who gave his son money without the wife's knowledge is in the wrong. The story says that the couple agreed to let their son stay at home while he's at university. The dad mentions that money isn't an issue for the household, but there's a big disparity in how each family member spends. The son got scolded by the wife for spending $7 on a meal, and then the dad found out she spent $160 on perfume. The dad then started giving the son money secretly, saying the son is responsible and uses it wisely.\n\nSo, the main points here are about fairness, communication, and the wife's reaction. The father feels the wife is being hypocritical, spending more on herself and then criticizing the son. He wants to support his son without the wife knowing, probably to protect the son from her criticism. But did he overstep by not discussing it with the wife first?\n\nIn a typical family, when you have shared finances, even if it's not a struggle, it's important to communicate major spending. The dad might think it's a small amount, but giving money to a child without the spouse's knowledge could be seen as undermining the wife's authority or creating financial secrecy. The wife might feel disrespected or that her concerns are being ignored. The dad's intention is to balance the spending, but the method could be problematic. The key issue is whether the dad should have discussed this with the wife first. If they had an open conversation about it, maybe they could find a solution together. But by acting without communication, he might be causing more tension. So, even if the dad's intentions are good, the action of not involving the wife might be in the wrong.\n"
