When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the father is in the wrong for giving his son money without his wife's knowledge. The situation involves the parents allowing their son to live at home during university. The wife is upset about the son spending $7 on a meal, while she spends $160 on perfume. The father then gives the son money secretly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of family finances. The parents say they have enough money, but there's a perceived imbalance in how each family member spends. The wife criticizes the son for a small expense but spends significantly more on perfume. The father confronts her, and she gets upset. Then he starts giving the son money without telling her.\n\nThe key points here are: Is the father wrong for bypassing his wife's knowledge? Financial decisions in a marriage usually require mutual agreement. The father's action could be seen as undermining the wife's authority, even if his intent is to support his son. The wife might feel disrespected or that her concerns about budgeting aren't being taken seriously. However, the father might argue that the wife's criticism is unreasonable compared to her own spending.\n\nBut in a marriage, both partners typically share financial responsibilities. Withholding this from his wife could lead to further conflict and erode trust. The father's decision to act unilaterally might be seen as dismissive of her feelings and the agreed-upon family budget. Even if the son is mature, the father didn't discuss this with his wife, which could be a breach of their partnership.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife's reaction to the $7 meal might be seen as overly critical, especially if their finances are stable. The father's intervention could be his way of balancing the family's financial priorities. However, the method of doing so without his wife's consent could be problematic.\n\nSo, the father's intention might be good, but the approach could be wrong. The answer likely depends on whether secret actions in a marriage are acceptable. Most would agree that transparency is important, so the father is in the wrong for not discussing it with his wife first, even if the wife's behavior was questionable.\n"
