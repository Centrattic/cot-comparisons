When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the father is in the wrong for giving his son money without his wife's knowledge.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The family is not struggling with money, but there's a big disparity in how each family member spends. The wife is upset with the son for spending $7 on a meal, while she spends $160 on perfume. The father, after some conflict, starts giving his son money secretly.\n\nSo, the key points are: the father's action of giving money without the wife's knowledge, the wife's reaction to the son's spending versus her own, and the father's justification that the son uses the money responsibly.\n\nThe user wants to know if the father is wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nNow, considering family dynamics. Financial decisions in a marriage typically require mutual agreement. Even if the wife's spending seems excessive, the father shouldn't act unilaterally. By giving the son money without her knowing, he's bypassing her, which could undermine their partnership. Even if he's trying to balance things, the method might be problematic. The wife might feel disrespected or not involved in family financial matters.\n\nOn the other hand, the father might think he's supporting his son against his wife's strictness. But in a marriage, transparency is important. So, even if the wife's behavior seems unfair, the father's solution of secrecy isn't appropriate. He should address the spending habits as a couple instead of acting alone.\n\nTherefore, the father is likely in the wrong for not discussing this with his wife first. The answer would be A.\n"
