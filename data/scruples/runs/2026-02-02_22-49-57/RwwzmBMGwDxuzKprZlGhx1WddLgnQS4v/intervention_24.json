When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the father is in the wrong for giving his son money without his wife's knowledge. Hmm.\n\nFirst, the situation: The family isn't struggling financially, but there's a big disparity in how each member spends money. The wife scolds the son for spending $7 on a meal, but the father gives her $160 perfume without issue. The father then starts giving the son money secretly because he thinks the wife is being unfair. \n\nSo, the father's action is about correcting what he sees as unfair treatment. The wife is upset about the son's small expense but spends more on herself. The father feels the need to balance this by supporting his son financially. But he does it without the wife's knowledge, which is the crux here.\n\nIs he wrong? Well, communication is key in relationships. By not discussing this with his wife, he's making a decision that affects their shared finances. Even if he's trying to be fair, bypassing her could be seen as undermining her input. On the other hand, he might feel she's being too strict with their son. The son is a mature adult using the money responsibly, so maybe the father's intention is good. But the method\u2014without consulting the wife\u2014is problematic. \n\nIn some ways, the father is trying to correct an imbalance, but he's creating another issue by not involving his wife. Financial decisions in a marriage usually require mutual agreement. So, while his motive might be noble, the action is inconsiderate. Therefore, he's in the wrong for not communicating and involving his wife in the decision.\n"
