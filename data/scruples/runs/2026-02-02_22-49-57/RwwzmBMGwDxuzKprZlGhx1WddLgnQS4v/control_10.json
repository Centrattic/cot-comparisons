When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the dad gave his son money without the wife's knowledge. The parents had agreed the son could stay at home during university. The family isn't short on money, but there's a big disparity in how much each family member spends. The wife criticized the son for spending $7 on a meal, while the dad noticed she bought perfume for $160.\n\nFirst, I need to consider family dynamics. The parents are supposed to be a team, right? If they're not on the same page about finances, conflicts can arise. The dad gave money to the son without discussing it with the wife. That's probably a problem because they might have agreed on handling the son's expenses together. If the wife was already upset about the $7 meal, the dad's action of secretly giving money might be seen as undermining her authority or not respecting their shared financial decisions. \n\nAlso, the wife's reaction to the perfume vs. the meal could be a red flag. The dad points out the inconsistency, which is valid. But instead of addressing it openly with the wife, he chose to act alone by giving his son extra money. That might have been his way of supporting the son, but it could have been handled better by discussing the financial priorities with his wife first.\n\nAnother angle: the son is an adult in university, so maybe he should be learning to manage his own money. However, since he's living at home, maybe the parents were covering some expenses, and the dad felt the wife was being overly strict. But the dad's solution was to bypass the wife, which could lead to more conflict. They should probably have a conversation about their financial expectations and how to handle the son's expenses during his studies.\n\nSo, the main issue is the lack of communication. Whether the dad is in the wrong depends on whether bypassing the wife was necessary. If they had discussed the wife's criticism and found a middle ground, maybe they could have avoided this. The dad's action might have been a reaction to his wife's inconsistency, but acting without her input could be seen as wrong because it's a family decision. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he didn't communicate with his wife about this financial decision.\n"
