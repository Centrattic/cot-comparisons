When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a parent giving money to their son without the wife's knowledge, and there's some tension about spending habits.\n\nFirst, the family agreed to let the son stay at home while he's at university. The parents say they have enough money, but there's a big disparity in how each family member spends. The wife scolds the son for spending $7 on a meal, but the father later finds out she spent $160 on perfume. The father gives his son money secretly because he feels the wife is being unfair. \n\nSo, the key points here are: the parents have enough money, but there's a disagreement on how much each person can spend. The wife is strict about the son's spending, but seems more lenient with her own. The father is trying to balance that by giving money to the son without telling his wife. \n\nThe question is whether the father is wrong for doing this. The wife's reaction to the $7 meal vs. her $160 perfume purchase suggests inconsistency. The father's action is an attempt to address this inconsistency. However, giving money without the partner's knowledge could be seen as undermining the wife's authority. But since the parents are co-parents, maybe they should have discussed this together. The father's intention is to support his son and correct what he sees as unfair treatment. \n\nOn the other hand, not involving the wife might lead to more conflict. But since the wife is already being inconsistent, the father's action could be a way to protect his son. The son is responsible with the money. So, the father's action might not be wrong, but the method of handling it without discussing with his wife could be problematic. However, the main issue is the wife's behavior. \n\nSo, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the father is trying to correct an unfair situation, but the approach could have been better. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and the main fault lies with the wife's inconsistency, the father's action is understandable.\n"
