When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about giving their son money without the wife knowing. Let's break down the details.\n\nFirst, the parents agreed to let their son stay with them during university. The family has enough money overall, but there's a big disparity in how each family member spends. The wife criticized the son for spending $7 on a meal, but then the husband found out she spent $160 on perfume. He confronted her, and she got upset. Then he started giving the son money secretly.\n\nSo, the key points are: the husband gave the son money without the wife's knowledge. The wife had an issue with the son's spending but spent more herself. The husband's action was to balance the perceived unfairness.\n\nBut is he wrong? Well, in a marriage, big financial decisions usually require both partners' agreement. Even though the wife's spending might seem inconsistent, giving money to the son without telling her could be seen as undermining their agreement. The son is an adult, but living at home, so maybe the parents should have a united front on supporting him. The husband's action might have caused conflict by not involving his wife, even if he thought the wife was being unfair. So, the answer might be A (Yes) because he didn't communicate and acted alone, which can create problems in the relationship. But maybe B if the husband thought he was helping the son fairly. But usually, in such situations, involving the partner is important. So leaning towards A.\n"
