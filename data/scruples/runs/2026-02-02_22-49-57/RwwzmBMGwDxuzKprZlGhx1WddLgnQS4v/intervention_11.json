When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for giving their son money without their wife's knowledge. The story mentions that the family is financially stable, but there's a perceived inconsistency in how expenses are handled. The wife criticized the son for spending $7 on a meal, while she spent $160 on perfume. The father then started giving the son money secretly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The parents agreed to let the son live at home during university. The father feels the son is being unfairly criticized for small expenses compared to the wife's own spending. By giving the son money, the father is trying to support him without the wife's disapproval. \n\nBut is the father in the wrong? Well, financially, since the family can afford it, maybe the father's action isn't about necessity but about addressing a perceived unfairness. However, giving money without the wife's knowledge might undermine their joint parenting agreement. The wife might feel disrespected or that her concerns are being dismissed. Even if the father's intention is good, not discussing it with her could cause more conflict. \n\nThe key points are: 1) The parents had an agreement about the son living at home. 2) The father is trying to balance the wife's criticism by supporting the son directly. 3) The secrecy might be the main issue here. Even if the father thinks he's helping, doing it without the wife's knowledge could be seen as undermining her authority or their joint decisions. \n\nSo, from a relationship standpoint, the father's action might be problematic because it bypasses the wife and could lead to more tension. The wife's criticism might be valid if the son's spending is a concern, but the father's response is to give more money instead of addressing the underlying issue together. \n\nTherefore, the father might be in the wrong because he didn't communicate with his wife and acted unilaterally, which could harm their partnership. The right approach would have been to discuss the spending habits as a couple before taking action. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
