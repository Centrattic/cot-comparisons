When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving their son money without the wife's knowledge. The story is about a family where the parents agreed to let their son live at home while he's in university. The wife criticized the son for spending $7 on a meal, but the author then noticed the wife spent $160 on perfume. The author decided to give the son money without telling the wife, arguing that the son is mature and responsible.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points here are about fairness in spending and the author's decision to bypass their wife. The parents are supposed to be co-parents, so making financial decisions without the other's knowledge could be an issue. The author's action might be seen as undermining the wife's authority or creating inconsistency in how the son is being taught to handle money.\n\nThe wife's criticism of the $7 meal versus her own $160 perfume purchase shows a discrepancy in their family's approach to spending. The author is trying to address this by giving the son money, but doing so without the wife's knowledge might be problematic. Even if the author's intention is good, the method of keeping it secret could lead to conflicts. Co-parenting typically requires communication and mutual agreement, especially on financial matters affecting the child.\n\nAlso, the son is living at home, and the parents had an agreement for him to stay. The author's decision to provide additional funds without discussing it with the wife might not align with their original agreement. The wife's reaction to the son's spending suggests she might have different financial boundaries, which the author is not respecting by acting unilaterally.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might believe they're teaching the son responsibility and that the wife's criticism was unfair. However, the right way to address the wife's behavior would be to discuss it openly with her instead of bypassing her. The secrecy here could damage their relationship and the son's understanding of financial responsibility if he's being given money without the parents' full agreement.\n\nSo, considering the need for parental consensus and open communication, the author's actions seem to be in the wrong. The correct approach would be to address the wife's spending habits directly and talk about setting consistent financial expectations with their son, rather than giving money behind her back.\n"
