When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the father is in the wrong for giving his son money without his wife's knowledge. The situation involves family finances and differing parental approaches to spending.\n\nFirst, the parents agreed their son would stay home during university. The father mentions they're financially stable but there's a big disparity in how family members use money. The example given is the wife scolding the son for $7 on a meal, while she spends $160 on perfume. The father confronts her about this inconsistency, leading her to upset. Then, he starts giving the son money secretly, without the wife's knowledge.\n\nKey points to consider: The father's action is about giving money to his son discreetly. The wife's reaction to the son's spending vs. her own might have prompted this. But since the parents are a unit in managing finances, giving money without consulting each other could be seen as undermining their agreement. Even if the wife's behavior seems inconsistent, the father's solution is to bypass her, which might not address the root issue. The son is an adult, so maybe the father wants to support him, but involving the wife is important for transparency and shared decision-making in the household.\n\nAlso, the father criticizes the wife for the $7 vs. $160 discrepancy but then acts unilaterally. This could create more tension if the wife finds out. The question is whether the father's action is wrong. From a relationship and communication standpoint, it's usually advised to discuss big decisions with your partner. Even if the wife's approach is questionable, the father's method of handling it by giving money without her knowledge might be problematic. The answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he didn't communicate and acted behind her back, which could harm trust and collaboration in the marriage.\n"
