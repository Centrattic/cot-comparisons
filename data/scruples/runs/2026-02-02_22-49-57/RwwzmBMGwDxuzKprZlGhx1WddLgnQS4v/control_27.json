When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the father is in the wrong for giving his son money without his wife's knowledge. First, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe parents agreed that their son would live at home while in university. The father mentions that money isn't an issue for the household, but there's a big disparity in how each family member's money is handled. The wife criticized the son for spending $7 on a meal, but the father gave the son more money after finding out the wife bought $160 perfume. The father then started giving his son money without telling his wife, and the son uses it responsibly.\n\nNow, the key points here are about fairness and communication. The wife is upset about the $7 meal, but the father is upset about the $160 perfume. The father's response was to secretly give money to the son, which might be a way to balance the perceived unfairness. However, giving money without the spouse's knowledge could be problematic. Even if the parents are in agreement about the son living at home, financial decisions usually require mutual agreement. The father's action might undermine the wife's authority and create resentment. Also, the wife's criticism of the son's spending might be a separate issue, but the father's solution was to bypass her by giving money without telling her. This could lead to more conflict. So, the father might be in the wrong because he didn't communicate with his wife and instead acted unilaterally, which isn't a good approach in a partnership. However, there's also the aspect of the wife being inconsistent in her spending habits. But the main issue is the secret giving of money without mutual discussion. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
