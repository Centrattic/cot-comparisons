When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the father) is in the wrong for giving his son money without his wife's knowledge. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the parents agreed to let their son stay at home while attending university. The father mentions that money isn't an issue, but there's a big disparity in how each family member spends. The wife criticizes the son for spending $7 on a meal, but then the father finds out she spent $160 on perfume. He gives the son money secretly to counterbalance what he sees as the wife's unfairness.\n\nSo, the main points are: the father is trying to protect his son from his wife's criticism by giving him money. The wife's reaction to the $7 versus her own $160 purchase seems unfair. The father's action is about correcting what he perceives as an imbalance. \n\nBut is he in the wrong? Well, the wife's behavior might be unreasonable, but the father's solution is to act behind her back. Even if his intentions are good, involving the son in a secret arrangement could affect family dynamics. Maybe the right approach would be to address the issue openly with the wife first. However, the father is trying to shield his son from criticism, which shows concern. \n\nOn the other hand, not involving the wife could lead to more conflict or mistrust. The father's action might be seen as undermining the wife's authority or contributing to the son's sense of needing to hide things. But given the wife's behavior, the father's motivation is understandable.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the father's action is a response to an unfair situation, but the method might not be the best. However, the question is about whether he's in the wrong. Since he's trying to balance the wife's criticism and support his son, even if the approach is secret, maybe he's not entirely wrong. Alternatively, maybe he's wrong for not addressing the issue with the wife directly. But the user's perspective is that the author isn't wrong. I think the answer would be B (No), but with a nuanced view.\n"
