When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the father is in the wrong for giving his son money without his wife's knowledge. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the parents agreed that their son would stay at home while attending university. The father mentions that money isn't an issue for the household, but there's a big disparity in how each family member's money is managed. The wife criticized the son for spending $7 on a meal, but then the father found out she spent $160 on perfume. The father felt this was unfair, so he started giving the son money secretly to help him out.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the father is wrong. The wife's reaction to the son's spending seems inconsistent with her own spending, which probably upset the father. However, by giving money to the son without the wife's knowledge, the father is acting behind her back. Even if the wife's behavior was unfair, the father's solution might not be the right approach. \n\nIn a marriage, transparency is usually important. If there's a disagreement about financial practices or parenting styles, the proper approach would be to discuss it openly with the wife. By secretly giving money to the son, the father is creating a situation where the son might feel favored, and it could lead to more conflict between the spouses. It might also undermine the wife's authority in managing the household finances if they've had prior agreements.\n\nAdditionally, the father is taking sides in what seems to be a disagreement between his wife and son by intervening without discussing it with his wife. Even if the wife's behavior was excessive, the father's method of handling it (without communication) could be seen as wrong because it doesn't address the root issue and might escalate the problem. \n\nThe key points here are transparency in marital decisions and addressing issues through communication rather than covert actions. The father's actions might be motivated by a desire to protect his son, but the method could be problematic. The wife might feel betrayed or that her concerns aren't being respected, which could harm their relationship. The son, on the other hand, might not learn the lesson about financial responsibility if he's being given money without understanding the context.\n\nSo, while the wife's initial reaction might not be fair, the father's response of giving money without her knowledge is likely the wrong approach. The correct action would have been to discuss the financial expectations with the wife first, perhaps come to a mutual agreement on how to handle the son's expenses, and avoid creating a situation where the son is being supported behind the wife's back.\n"
