When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about giving money to their son without the wife's knowledge. The key points are the parents' agreement on the son living at home during university, the financial situation, and the conflict over spending habits.\n\nFirst, the parents agreed the son would stay at home. The author mentions they have enough money, but there's a big disparity in how each family member spends. The wife criticized the son for spending $7 on a meal, while the author noticed she spent $160 on perfume. The author then decided to give the son money secretly because they felt the wife was being unfair.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. The wife is upset because the author didn't consult her about giving money to the son. Even though the author thinks the wife was being inconsistent, withholding that information could be seen as undermining her authority. The parents are a team, and financial decisions usually require mutual agreement. The author's action might be considered disrespectful or secretive, leading to conflict. However, the author's intent was to support the son in a fair way, which is understandable. But the method\u2014without discussing with the wife\u2014might be the issue. So, maybe the author is at fault for not communicating, even if the motivation was good.\n"
