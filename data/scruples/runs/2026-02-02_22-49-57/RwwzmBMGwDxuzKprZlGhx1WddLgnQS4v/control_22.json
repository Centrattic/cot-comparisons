When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the father is in the wrong for giving his son money without the wife's knowledge. \n\nFirst, the situation: The family agreed to let their son stay at home while he's in university. They have enough money, but there's a disparity in how family members spend. The wife criticizes the son for spending $7, but the father finds it unfair when she spends $160 on perfume. The father then starts giving the son money secretly.\n\nSo, the key points are: the father feels the wife is being inconsistent, and he wants to support the son by giving him money. But he does this without the wife's knowledge, which is a big red flag. \n\nIn a marriage, financial decisions typically require mutual agreement. Even if the father thinks the wife is being unfair, bypassing her by giving money to the son without her knowledge undermines their partnership. The father's action might be a response to the wife's criticism, but it's not addressing the root issue. The wife's spending on perfume versus the son's small expenses could be a matter of priorities, but the father's solution is secretive and could damage trust. \n\nAlso, the son is an adult, so he should be responsible for his own finances. However, the parents agreed to let him stay at home, which might include covering some expenses. But the father's secret financial support could create tension in the marriage. The real issue here is the lack of communication between the parents about their financial values and how they handle their children's expenses. \n\nThe father's action of giving money without the wife's consent is likely to be seen as inconsiderate and disrespectful. Even if his intention was to help the son, it's important to involve the spouse in such decisions. So, the answer is probably that the father is in the wrong.\n"
