When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the father is in the wrong for giving his son money without his wife's knowledge. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the family agreed to let their son live at home during university. The parents say they have enough money, but there's a big disparity in how each family member's money is managed. The wife criticized the son for spending $7 on a meal, while the father later found out she spent $160 on a perfume. The father then started giving his son money secretly because he felt the wife was being unfair.\n\nSo, the main points are: the wife is strict about the son's spending, the father thinks she's inconsistent, and he's trying to give his son some financial freedom without her knowing. \n\nNow, the question is whether the father is wrong. Let's consider the dynamics here. In a household, if both parents are supposed to be managing finances together, giving money without the other's knowledge could be seen as undermining the partner. Even if the wife's reaction to the son's $7 meal was excessive, the father's solution of secretly giving money might not be the best approach. It could create more tension and mistrust. Instead, maybe they should have a discussion about their differing views on spending and agree on a middle ground. \n\nAlso, the wife's spending on perfume vs. the son's meal shows different priorities, but that doesn't necessarily justify the father's secret actions. The key issue is communication. The father's action might be an attempt to help his son, but it's done without transparency, which could harm the marital relationship. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the father is right to provide for his son and balance the wife's strictness. But generally, financial decisions in a marriage should involve both partners. So, the father is probably in the wrong because he didn't communicate with his wife, even if he disagreed with her approach.\n"
