When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for giving his son money without his wife's knowledge. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the parents agreed to let their son live at home during university. The author mentions that money isn't an issue in the household, but there's a big disproportion in how each family member spends. The son spent $7 on a meal and got criticized by the wife. When the author talks to the son, he says not to worry, but then later confronts the wife about her spending $160 on perfume, which seems like a bigger amount. The author then starts giving the son money secretly to help him, as the son uses it responsibly.\n\nHmm, so the main points here are about financial fairness and communication. The author feels the wife is being inconsistent by criticizing the son's small expense while she spends much more. But giving money without the wife's knowledge might be a problem because it's a joint financial matter. Even though the author thinks it's fair, withholding the wife from the decision could lead to trust issues. The wife might feel disrespected or that her concerns about the son's spending aren't being addressed properly.\n\nBut the author's intention is to support the son and correct what he sees as unfair treatment. However, the method\u2014acting behind the wife's back\u2014could be the issue. It's possible the wife has her own reasons for being strict with the son's spending, maybe to teach responsibility. The author's solution (secretly giving money) might undermine that. Also, even if the family has enough money, how it's managed is a joint responsibility. Not discussing with the wife could be seen as violating that partnership.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to balance what he perceives as unfairness. The wife's reaction to the perfume vs. the meal might be a red flag that she's being inconsistent. The author's action could be seen as taking a stand when the wife isn't addressing the inconsistency. But the problem is whether the method is wrong. Giving money without consent might be a breach of trust, even if the intention is good.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a toss-up. The intent vs. the action. But in relationships, communication is key. By not discussing it with the wife, the author might be causing more issues. The wife might feel excluded from decisions affecting the family finances. Even if the money isn't limited, how it's managed should be mutual. Therefore, the author's action, while well-intentioned, might be in the wrong because it bypasses the wife's input and could erode trust.\n"
