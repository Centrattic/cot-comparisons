When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for giving their son money without the wife's knowledge. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the parents agreed to let their son stay at home while he's in university, which is close. They mention that money isn't an issue, but there's a big disparity in how different family members spend. The wife criticized the son for spending $7 on a meal, but then the husband found out she spent $160 on perfume. He confronts her, leading to tension. Then the husband starts giving the son money secretly.\n\nNow, the key points here are about financial responsibility within the family. The husband's action of giving money without the wife's knowledge might be seen as undermining her authority or creating a double standard. They're a couple, so major financial decisions usually require mutual agreement. The wife was upset about the son's spending, so the husband's response was to give him more money, which could be seen as enabling the son's spending habits or not respecting the wife's concerns.\n\nThe wife's reaction might be over the son spending $7, but she spends $160 on perfume. That's a big difference. The husband's frustration is understandable, but his solution was to bypass the wife, which isn't a good way to handle disagreements. It's important in a marriage to communicate and resolve conflicts together, not take unilateral actions, especially regarding finances. \n\nAlso, giving the son money without the wife's knowledge could lead to more conflict. The wife might feel disrespected or that the husband isn't standing by her decision. Even if the son uses the money responsibly, the method of giving it secretly is problematic. The husband should address the wife's concerns with her, maybe find a middle ground instead of acting alone.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the husband points out the discrepancy, but instead of resolving it through discussion, he takes sides by giving the son money. That doesn't address the root issue. The bigger issue might be how the family manages money and sets boundaries for different members. The husband's action, while maybe well-intentioned, is not the right approach because it's done behind the wife's back and could escalate the conflict.\n\nSo, the answer is A. The author is in the wrong for not communicating with his wife and for acting in a way that undermines their partnership and the agreed-upon financial boundaries.\n"
