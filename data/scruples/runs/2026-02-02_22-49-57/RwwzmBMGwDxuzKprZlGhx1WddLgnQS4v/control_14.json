When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the father is in the wrong for giving his son money without his wife's knowledge. \n\nFirst, the context is that the family isn't short on money, but there's a disparity in how each member spends. The wife criticized the son for a $7 meal, while she spent $160 on perfume. The father felt this was unfair and decided to give the son money secretly. The son uses the money responsibly.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the father bypassing his wife's input. Even though the wife's criticism seems excessive, the father's solution was to act without her knowledge. In a marriage, financial decisions, especially involving children, should ideally be mutual. The father's action might be seen as undermining his wife's authority or not addressing the root problem (her spending habits) directly. \n\nHowever, the father's intention was to balance what he saw as unfair treatment. But by not discussing it with his wife first, he's creating a situation where he's making a unilateral decision. This could lead to more conflict because the wife might feel disrespected or betrayed. The son is also in a tricky position between his parents. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife's reaction to the son's $7 meal versus her own $160 purchase does seem disproportionate. The father might have felt compelled to act to protect his son. But the method of action\u2014without the wife's knowledge\u2014could be problematic. \n\nSo, the key points are: the father acted without consulting his wife, which might breach trust. Even if his intention was good, the secrecy matters. The wife's behavior is questionable, but the father's approach could be seen as wrong because it didn't involve communication. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely that the father is in the wrong (A), but there's nuance. However, based on typical expectations in relationships, secrecy in such a matter would be considered wrong.\n"
