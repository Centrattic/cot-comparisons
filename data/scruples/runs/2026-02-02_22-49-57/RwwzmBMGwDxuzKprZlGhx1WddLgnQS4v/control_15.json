When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the father is in the wrong for giving his son money without his wife's knowledge. I need to analyze the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the family is living together while the son is at university. The parents agreed on this arrangement. The father mentions that money isn't an obstacle, but there's a big disparity in how each family member spends. The wife criticizes the son for spending $7 on a meal, but then later the father notices she spent $160 on perfume. He confronts her, which leads to tension. Then, the father starts giving his son money secretly to avoid the wife's criticism.\n\nSo, the key points here are the parents' differing views on spending. The wife sees the son's $7 meal as a problem, but the father thinks it's unfair compared to her spending $160. By giving the son money without the wife's knowledge, the father is trying to support his son's independence but is also circumventing the wife's input. \n\nThis situation is about marital communication and shared financial responsibilities. If the parents had discussed their concerns openly and found a middle ground, maybe the father wouldn't have felt the need to act behind her back. The fact that he didn't involve his wife in this decision could be seen as a breach of trust, even if his intentions were good. It's possible he's trying to shield his son from criticism, but the method he chose might undermine the partnership between him and his wife. \n\nHowever, the wife's reaction to the son's spending might be overly strict, especially given her own expenditure. The father could argue that he's balancing things out by supporting his son's needs. Still, in a marriage, financial decisions typically should be mutual. The father's action might be a solution to an unfair situation, but the lack of communication with his wife is problematic. \n\nSo, is the father in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. He's trying to help his son, but the method is secretive. The answer might hinge on whether the wife should have been involved in the decision. Since the parents agreed to have the son live at home, perhaps they should have set clear financial boundaries together. The father's action bypasses that agreement, which could be seen as wrong because it's not transparent. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he didn't communicate with his wife, even if the wife's initial criticism was unfair.\n"
