When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The situation is about a parent giving their son money without the wife's knowledge. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the parents have an agreement for their son to stay with them during university. The family isn't struggling financially, but there's a big discrepancy in how much each family member spends. The wife criticizes the son for spending $7 on a meal, but then the husband finds out she spent $160 on perfume. The husband then starts giving the son money secretly, without the wife's knowledge. The son uses the money responsibly for things like food.\n\nSo, the key points here are about financial fairness and communication within the family. The husband's actions of giving money without telling his wife could be seen as undermining their partnership. Even though the wife's reaction seems excessive (getting upset over $7 but spending $160 on perfume), the husband's solution was to bypass her entirely. That might be a problem because financial decisions in a household should ideally be discussed together, especially when it involves their child. \n\nThe husband's action might be an attempt to correct the imbalance he perceives, but doing it secretly could damage trust. The wife might feel that her input isn't respected, and the husband's solution is unilateral. It's possible that the root issue is communication problems rather than the act of giving money itself. If they had discussed the spending habits and agreed on a fair approach, maybe the situation could have been resolved without the husband acting behind her back. \n\nAlso, even if the son is mature and uses the money well, the husband's method of giving money without informing the wife could set a precedent where financial decisions aren't made jointly. This could lead to more conflicts in the future. So, the husband might be in the wrong for not addressing the issue with his wife directly instead of taking matters into his own hands.\n"
