When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is wrong for giving their son money without the wife's knowledge. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the parents agreed to let their son stay at home during university. The family has enough money, but there's a discrepancy in how each member spends. The wife criticized the son for spending $7 on a meal, while she herself spent $160 on perfume. The father confronted her about it, and she got upset. Then, the father started giving the son money secretly, saying the son is mature and uses it for food or other things.\n\nHmm, so the main issue is the father bypassing the wife's input. Even though the wife's reaction seems excessive (getting upset over $7 vs her $160 perfume), the father's response was to give the son money without her knowledge. In a household where finances are usually a shared responsibility, not consulting her might be problematic. The father is trying to balance the spending, but doing so behind her back could undermine their partnership. Even if the intention is good, not discussing with his wife first could lead to more conflict. So, maybe the father is at fault for not maintaining open communication with his wife. The wife's behavior isn't great either, but the father's action of not involving her is the key point here. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
