When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the father is in the wrong for giving his son money without his wife's knowledge. The situation involves financial discrepancies in the household. \n\nFirst, the parents agreed to let their son stay at home during university. The dad notices the wife is critical of the son spending $7 on a meal but then she spends $160 on perfume. He feels this is unfair, so he starts giving the son money secretly.\n\nNow, the key points here are about fairness and communication. The father's action\u2014giving money without the wife's knowledge\u2014could be seen as undermining their agreement. Even if the wife's reaction seems disproportionate, the dad's response was to act without discussing it with her. That might be problematic because it bypasses their partnership in parenting decisions. \n\nFinancial management is a shared responsibility in a marriage. By not involving his wife, the dad might be creating tension. The wife's criticism of the son's spending versus her own higher expenditure is a valid point, but the solution shouldn't be to bypass her. Open communication would be better than secret actions. \n\nThe son is an adult, so giving him money for his own use is reasonable, but the method matters. The dad's approach could lead to resentment or mistrust between him and his wife. Even if the intention is to support the son, the secrecy is an issue. \n\nSo, while the wife's behavior might be unfair, the dad's response of acting without her knowledge likely makes him at fault. The right approach would be to address the financial priorities together as a couple, not through unilateral decisions.\n"
