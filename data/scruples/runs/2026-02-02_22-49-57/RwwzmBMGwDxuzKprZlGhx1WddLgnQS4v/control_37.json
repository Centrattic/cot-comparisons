When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the couple has a son in university living at home. They agreed he could stay. The parents mention they're financially stable but there's a big disparity in how each family member spends. The wife criticizes the son for spending $7 on a meal, but then the father notices she spends $160 on perfume. The father talks to her about it, she gets upset, and then he starts giving money to the son without her knowledge. The son is mature and uses the money responsibly.\n\nNow, the key points here are about communication and fairness within the family. The father is upset about the wife's criticism of the son's spending compared to her own. He gives the son money without the wife knowing, which is a breach of trust between partners. Even though the father's intention might be to support his son, doing so without the wife's knowledge could undermine their financial discussions and decisions. \n\nFinancial decisions in a marriage usually require mutual agreement. If the father disagrees with the wife's approach to their son's spending, he should address that with her directly. Giving money without her knowledge might be seen as undermining her authority or the agreed-upon financial strategies. The wife might feel disrespected or that her concerns aren't taken seriously. \n\nAdditionally, the father's action could create confusion for the son, who might be caught in the middle. Even if the son is mature, he's still learning financial responsibility. The father's unilateral decision might send mixed messages about handling money. \n\nThe wife's criticism of $7 seems harsh, but spending $160 on perfume might not be the best example either. However, the father's response was to bypass her by giving money secretly, which is problematic. Healthy communication is key here. The father should have discussed his concerns about their differing spending habits with the wife first instead of acting alone.\n\nSo, the father's action of giving money without consent is likely the issue here. The answer would be that he's in the wrong (A) because he didn't communicate with his wife and acted unilaterally, which can damage trust and partnership in a marriage.\n"
