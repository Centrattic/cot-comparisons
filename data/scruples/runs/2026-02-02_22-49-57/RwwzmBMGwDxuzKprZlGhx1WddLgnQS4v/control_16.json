When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person (the father) is in the wrong for giving his son money without his wife's knowledge. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The parents agreed to let their son live at home while he goes to university. Money isn't an issue, but there's a big difference in how each family member spends. The son spends $7 on a meal, and the wife criticizes him. The father then sides with the son, pointing out that she spent $160 on perfume. Then the father starts giving the son money secretly.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the father is giving the son money without the wife knowing. The wife is upset about the son's spending, but the father thinks it's unfair compared to her spending. \n\nNow, considering that the parents are married, financial decisions usually involve both partners. Even though the father might think the wife is being strict, giving money to the son without her knowledge could be seen as undermining her authority. The wife might feel disrespected or that her financial preferences aren't being considered. Also, even though the family has money, the way they manage it might be important to them. The father's action could lead to conflict because he's acting unilaterally.\n\nOn the other hand, the father's intention is to support his son's needs, and the son is responsible with the money. But in a marriage, transparency is key. The father's action might be seen as secretive, which can cause trust issues. The wife's reaction to the son's $7 meal versus her own $160 perfume might be a red flag, but the father's solution is to bypass her, which isn't the healthiest approach.\n\nSo, even if the father's intent is good, the method\u2014without discussing with the wife\u2014might be wrong. The correct approach would be to address the spending habits as a couple and find a mutual agreement rather than giving money behind her back. Therefore, the father is in the wrong.\n"
