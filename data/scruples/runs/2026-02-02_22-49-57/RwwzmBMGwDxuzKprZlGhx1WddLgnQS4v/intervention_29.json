When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who gave their son money without the wife's knowledge is in the wrong. They want to know if the answer is A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The parents agreed to let their son live at home during university. The husband gives the son money secretly because the wife is upset with the son for spending $7 on a meal, while she herself spends $160 on perfume. The husband thinks the wife is being unfair, so he gives the son money to help him without her knowing.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The key points are: the husband acted alone without informing his wife, there's a discrepancy in how money is spent between family members, and the wife's reaction seems disproportionate.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, family dynamics can be complex. If the parents had agreed on a certain financial arrangement for the son, then the husband giving money without her knowledge might break that agreement. The wife might feel disrespected or that her decisions aren't being respected. On the other hand, the husband saw an unfair situation and tried to correct it, which could be seen as his trying to support his son.\n\nBut in a marriage, financial decisions usually require mutual agreement, especially when involving children. Acting unilaterally might undermine the wife's authority and create tension. Even if the husband's intention was good, the method of withholding the wife's knowledge is problematic. It's about communication and respect in the relationship.\n\nSo, the husband isn't necessarily \"wrong\" in wanting to support his son, but the way he did it without involving his wife is where the issue lies. However, the question is whether he is in the wrong. If the answer is based on typical relationship advice, acting without the spouse's knowledge in financial matters is generally discouraged. Therefore, the answer would be A (yes, he's in the wrong) because he didn't communicate and acted behind his wife's back, even if his intentions were good. But if the focus is on the fairness of the son's treatment, maybe not. But traditional advice would stress communication.\n\nAlternatively, maybe the wife's reaction is the issue, but the question is about the husband's actions. Since he didn't discuss with her, A is the answer.\n"
