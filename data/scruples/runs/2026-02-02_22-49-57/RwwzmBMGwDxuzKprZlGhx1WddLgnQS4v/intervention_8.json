When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for giving their son money without the wife's knowledge. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the husband and wife agreed to let their son stay at home while he's in university. The family is not short on money, but there's a big difference in how much each family member spends. The son spends $7 on a meal, and the wife criticizes him for it. Then the husband points out that the wife spent $160 on perfume, which he finds unfair. The wife gets upset and goes to the bathroom. Two weeks later, the husband starts giving the son money without the wife's knowledge, saying the son uses it responsibly for food and entertainment.\n\nNow, the question is whether the husband is in the wrong. Let me consider different angles. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, giving money to a child without the spouse's knowledge could be seen as undermining the spouse. The wife's criticism of the son's spending might be a red flag for the husband, but he chooses to contradict her publicly and then go behind her back. That could create tension and a lack of trust in the marriage. Even if the husband thinks he's being fair, the method of bypassing the wife could be problematic.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband might feel that the wife is being overly critical of the son's small expenses while spending significantly more herself. He might believe that supporting the son financially is necessary to protect him from the wife's harshness. However, even if his intentions are good, the action of keeping it a secret could lead to more conflict. The wife might feel disrespected or not involved in decisions about their child's finances, especially since they live at home.\n\nAnother point is that the husband and wife might have different views on financial management. The husband could think the wife's reaction is too strict, while the wife might think the son should learn to manage his money. But instead of discussing this together as a couple, the husband takes unilateral action. This could be seen as not working collaboratively as a team in parenting.\n\nAlso, the son is an adult in university, so the parents might be transitioning from providing full support to teaching financial responsibility. If the husband is giving money without the wife's input, it might complicate the son's learning process about money management. The wife's criticism might be part of trying to teach that, even if it's done in a harsh way.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the husband is trying to balance the perceived unfairness between the son's $7 and the wife's $160. However, the way he addresses it by giving money secretly might not be the best approach. Open communication between the couple could have been a better solution. The husband's action could be seen as a way to avoid conflict, but it might lead to bigger issues in the long run, like the wife feeling betrayed or the son becoming dependent on the husband's secret support.\n\nSo, weighing these factors, the husband's action of giving money without the wife's knowledge could be seen as wrong because it undermines the wife's role and creates a lack of transparency in the relationship. Even if his intentions are good, the method is problematic. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, he's in the wrong). But some might argue that he's trying to protect the son and is not in the wrong. But given the potential damage to the marital relationship, I think the answer leans towards A.\n"
