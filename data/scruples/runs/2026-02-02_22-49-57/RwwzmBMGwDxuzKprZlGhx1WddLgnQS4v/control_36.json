When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for giving their son money without their wife's knowledge. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the family has enough money, but there's a big disparity in how each member spends. The wife is upset because the son spent $7 on a meal, but she bought perfume for $160. The author thinks that's unfair and talks to his wife about it, which causes an argument. Then, the author starts secretly giving money to the son so he can spend without criticism.\n\nSo, the key points here are about fairness in spending, the parents' communication, and the author acting without consulting the wife. The wife's reaction to the son's $7 meal seems disproportionate compared to her own $160 purchase. The author is trying to balance this by giving the son money, but doing it behind the wife's back.\n\nNow, considering the question: Is the author in the wrong? Well, they did act without their wife's knowledge. Even if their intention was to help the son, not involving the spouse in financial decisions could be problematic. Marriage often involves shared financial responsibilities, and making a decision like this without discussing it with the spouse might lead to more conflicts. The author might have thought they were helping, but the secrecy could undermine trust. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife's reaction does seem excessive. Maybe the author felt they had to intervene because the wife was being overly critical. However, the right approach might have been to discuss the spending disparity with the wife and come to an agreement together, rather than acting unilaterally. \n\nSo, the author's action is problematic because they didn't communicate with their spouse. Even if the wife was being unfair, the solution shouldn't involve secrecy. The author should address the issue through open communication instead of giving money behind her back. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
