When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author gave their son money without the wife's knowledge. The parents had agreed that the son would stay at home while attending university. The wife is upset about the son spending $7 on a meal, but she spent $160 on a perfume. The author feels the financial expectations are unfair and decided to support the son by giving him money secretly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider family dynamics and communication. The author and wife are partners, so major financial decisions usually require mutual agreement. Even though they have enough money overall, the author bypassed the wife, which might be a problem. But the wife's reaction to the son's small expense versus her own larger one seems disproportionate. The author might think the wife is being unfair, hence the secret support.\n\nIs giving money to the son without the spouse's consent wrong? Financial decisions in a household should typically be discussed. The author might have felt the need to act without consent because the wife was being unreasonable. But by not communicating, the author could be causing marital tension. The wife might feel disrespected or that her authority is undermined. However, the author's intention was to support the son fairly. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife's criticism of a $7 meal versus her $160 perfume is inconsistent. The author points out this inconsistency, which might be a valid point. The son is a mature student using the money responsibly. The author's action could be seen as correcting an unfair situation. But the method (not involving the wife) is questionable. \n\nIn many relationships, financial decisions are joint, so the author's secrecy could be a breach of trust. However, if the wife's behavior was truly unfair and the author felt compelled to act, maybe it's a justified act of support. The key is whether the author should have addressed the wife's behavior with her instead of acting alone. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author's method (secretive giving) is wrong despite the intention. If the author had discussed the issue with the wife first, maybe they could have found a solution together. But since the author bypassed the wife, it might be considered wrong, even if the motive was good. Alternatively, if the wife was being unreasonable and the author felt the need to act to protect the son, it might be seen as not wrong. \n\nI think the main issue is the lack of communication between the spouses. While the wife's reaction seems unfair, the author's solution of bypassing her could create more problems. So the author might be in the wrong for not discussing it with the wife first, even if the intent was to help the son. Therefore, the answer might be A (in the wrong). But some might argue it's not wrong because the wife was being unfair.\n"
