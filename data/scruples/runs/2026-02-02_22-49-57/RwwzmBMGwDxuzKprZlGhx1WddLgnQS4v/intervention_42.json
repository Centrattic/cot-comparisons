When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the dad is giving his son money without his wife's knowledge. The parents agreed to let their son live at home while he's in university. The wife is upset with the son for spending $7 on a meal, while she spent $160 on perfume. The dad steps in, tells the son not to worry, and then starts giving him money secretly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' agreement. They both agreed to have the son stay at home, so maybe they also had some understanding about expenses. If the wife is the one handling finances, maybe she expected the son's expenses to be managed through her, but the dad is bypassing her by giving money directly. That could be a problem because it disrupts the family's financial agreement.\n\nThe dad's reasoning is that the wife is being unfair by criticizing the son for a small expense while she spends more on herself. But he's choosing to give money without discussing it with his wife. This could lead to resentment because the wife might feel disrespected or that the dad isn't supporting her decisions. Financial decisions usually require mutual agreement in a marriage, so acting unilaterally might be wrong.\n\nAlso, the dad's action of giving money without consulting the wife could undermine their partnership. Even if he thinks he's helping the son, it might create tension between him and his wife. The wife's anger when she bought the perfume might indicate different spending priorities. The dad's approach might not address the root issue but instead create more conflict by secretly funding the son, which the wife might see as favoritism.\n\nOn the other hand, the son is using the money responsibly, and the dad is trying to protect him from his wife's strictness. But the method of giving money without the wife's knowledge is problematic. The right approach would be to discuss the situation with the wife first and find a mutual solution rather than acting behind her back.\n\nSo, considering all this, the dad is acting against the marital agreement and possibly causing more conflict. Therefore, he might be in the wrong.\n"
