When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the main issue is that the father gave his son money without the wife's knowledge. The wife was upset about the son spending $7 on a meal, while she spent $160 on perfume. The father thought the wife was being unfair, so he started secretly giving the son money.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parents agreed to let the son live at home during university. The family isn't short on money, but there's a big discrepancy in how each member spends. The father feels the wife is being overly critical of the son's small expenses, while she spends more on herself. He gave the son money to help him without the wife knowing, probably to balance things out.\n\nIs the father wrong? Well, in a relationship, financial decisions usually require mutual agreement. Even though the wife's reaction might seem harsh, the father's solution was to act behind her back. That could lead to trust issues. Even if his intent was good, not communicating with his wife about giving money to the son might be a problem. He should have discussed his concerns with her instead of taking unilateral action. The wife might feel disrespected or unheard if he didn't talk to her first. Also, managing family finances jointly is important; keeping secrets about giving money could cause more conflict. So, maybe the father is in the wrong for not discussing it with his wife before acting.\n"
