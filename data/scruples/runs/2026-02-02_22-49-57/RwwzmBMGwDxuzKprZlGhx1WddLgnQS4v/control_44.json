When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the father is in the wrong for giving his son money without the wife's knowledge. \n\nFirst, the situation: The parents agreed to let their son live at home during university. The father gives the son money secretly because he thinks the wife is being overly critical of the son's spending. The example given is the wife criticized the son for $7 on a meal but bought a $160 perfume. The father feels this is unfair and decides to support the son financially without the wife knowing.\n\nNow, considering the father's actions. The main issue here is the lack of communication with the wife. Even if the wife's reaction to the son's spending was harsh, the father's solution was to bypass her entirely. Financial decisions in a household, especially involving a child, should ideally be discussed as a couple. By giving the son money without her knowledge, the father is undermining their partnership and possibly creating financial tension. \n\nAlso, the father's action might not address the root problem. The wife's criticism and her own spending habits might need a conversation between the parents, not a unilateral decision. The father could have discussed the discrepancy with the wife instead of acting alone. \n\nAdditionally, the son is an adult in university, so managing his own finances is important. But the parents might have agreed on a certain approach. If the father is providing extra money without the mother's consent, it might disrupt their agreed-upon parenting strategy.\n\nHowever, the father's intention was to support the son and correct what he saw as unfair treatment. But the method of doing so without the wife's knowledge is problematic. It's about respect for the marital partnership and the potential for secrecy to cause more issues.\n\nSo, even if the wife's behavior was questionable, the father's response was to act in the shadows, which can be seen as wrong because it avoids communication and could lead to further conflict. Therefore, the answer would be that the father is in the wrong.\n"
