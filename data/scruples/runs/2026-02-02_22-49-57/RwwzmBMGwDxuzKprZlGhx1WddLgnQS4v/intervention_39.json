When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the father is in the wrong for giving his son money without his wife's knowledge. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the parents agreed that their son would stay at home while attending university. The father mentions they have enough money, but there's a big disparity in how each family member spends. The son spent $7 on a meal, and the mother criticized him for that. Later, the father notices she spent $160 on perfume and confronts her about the inconsistency. Then, the father starts secretly giving the son money without the wife's knowledge.\n\nSo, the key points here are about fairness, communication, and parental decision-making. The father is acting to address what he perceives as unfair treatment by the mother. He's trying to support his son, who he says is responsible with money, without the mother knowing. But he didn't communicate with his wife first, which is a problem. \n\nIn a marriage, major financial decisions, even regarding children, usually require mutual agreement. By not discussing this with his wife, the father might be undermining her authority and creating a situation where the parents aren't on the same page. This could lead to more conflict. Also, the wife's criticism of the son versus her own spending might indicate different priorities, but that doesn't necessarily justify the father's secret action. \n\nOn the other hand, the father is trying to protect his son from what he sees as unfair criticism. However, the correct approach would be to address the issue with his wife first, perhaps by discussing their differing views on spending and setting consistent guidelines for the son. By giving money without her knowledge, he's making a unilateral decision that could complicate family dynamics further.\n\nSo, the father's actions are problematic because he didn't communicate with his wife, which is essential in a marriage. Even if his intentions are good, the method is flawed. Therefore, the answer is likely A (he's in the wrong).\n"
