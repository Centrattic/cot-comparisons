When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a parent giving their son money without the other parent's knowledge. The parents agreed to let their son live at home while he's at university. The author mentions that their household has enough money, but there's a big disparity in how each family member spends.\n\nThe son spends $7 on a meal, and the wife is upset about that. The author defends the son, pointing out that the wife bought a $160 perfume. The author then starts giving the son money secretly. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The key point is that the author gave money without the wife's knowledge. Even if the author felt the wife was being unfair, bypassing her might be a problem. In a marriage, financial decisions usually require mutual agreement, especially when involving the children. The author might think they're helping the son, but doing it behind the wife's back could create tension and distrust.\n\nAlso, the wife's reaction to the son's $7 meal versus her own $160 perfume seems like a discrepancy in how money is valued. The author's intention was to support the son, but the method of doing so without consulting the wife might be the issue. Even if the author thinks the wife is being unreasonable, the appropriate step would be to discuss it with her rather than taking unilateral action.\n\nAnother angle: the author might have valid concerns about the wife's spending habits, but addressing that through open communication would be better. The act of giving money secretly could be seen as undermining the wife's authority and creating a rift in the marriage. The son is an adult, but the parents are still making decisions about his finances, which might not be necessary if he's managing his own money responsibly.\n\nSo, considering these points, the author's action of giving money without the wife's knowledge might be the root of the problem. The fairness aspect is there, but the method of handling it without discussing with the spouse probably makes the author at fault.\n"
