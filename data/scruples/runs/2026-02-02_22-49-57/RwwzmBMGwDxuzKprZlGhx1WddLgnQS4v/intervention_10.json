When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for giving their son money without the wife's knowledge. The story is from Reddit's \"Am I the Asshole?\" subreddit, so it's a classic AITA situation.\n\nFirst, the parents agreed to let the son live at home during university. They mention that money isn't an issue, but there's a perceived inequality in how each family member spends money. The wife criticized the son for spending $7 on a meal, but then the husband found out she spent $160 on perfume. The husband felt this was unfair, so he started secretly giving the son money to balance things out.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The husband's intention was to protect his son from the wife's criticism and provide financial support. The wife felt the son was wasteful, but the husband saw her spending as excessive. The son uses the money responsibly. \n\nThe key points: Did the husband act wrong by not consulting the wife? Family finances are typically a shared responsibility. If the husband made a unilateral decision without discussing it with his spouse, that could be a problem, even if his motives were good. However, if the wife's behavior towards the son was unreasonable, the husband might have felt justified in helping. \n\nBut in relationships, transparency is important. The husband's action of giving money without the wife's knowledge might have been a way to support his son, but it could strain the marriage. The wife's criticism might stem from different values or budgeting concerns. The husband's response to confront her about her own spending is valid, but giving money secretly could lead to more conflict. \n\nSo, the husband's actions have both a good intention and a potential fault. The question is whether the means justify the ends. Since the husband didn't communicate with his wife about this decision, it could be seen as undermining her authority or creating a double standard. However, if the wife was being overly critical, the husband's intervention might be understandable. \n\nIn many cases, financial decisions in a marriage require mutual agreement. The husband's action might be considered wrong because he didn't involve his wife in the decision-making process, even if the outcome was positive for the son. The answer might be A (yes, he's in the wrong) because of the lack of communication. But some might argue B (no) because he was protecting his son from unfair criticism. \n\nBut the subreddit often considers both intent and the situation's context. The husband's intent was to help his son, but the method was secretive. The wife's behavior might be an issue too. However, in terms of the husband's actions, not consulting the wife is a red flag. So leaning towards A, but not entirely sure. Maybe the answer is A because of the lack of communication, but others might see it as B due to the wife's behavior. I think the consensus would be A because financial decisions in a marriage should be mutual.\n"
