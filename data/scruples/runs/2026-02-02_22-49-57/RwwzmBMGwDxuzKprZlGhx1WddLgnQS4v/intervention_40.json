When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for giving their son money without the wife's knowledge. \n\nFirst, the context: The family has enough money, but there's a big disparity in how each family member spends. The wife is upset with the son for spending $7 on a meal, while she spent $160 on perfume. The father talks to the son, tells him not to worry, then later confronts the wife about her spending. The father starts giving the son money secretly because he thinks the wife is being unfair.\n\nNow, the key points here. The father is trying to support his son financially, but without the wife's knowledge. The wife is clearly upset about the son's spending, which the father sees as hypocritical. The father's action is about giving money to the son to help him be more independent, and the son uses it responsibly. \n\nBut the main issue is whether the father did the right thing by not involving the wife. Since the husband and wife are a couple, major financial decisions, especially involving their child, should ideally be discussed together. Even though the father's intention is good, bypassing the wife's input might cause tension. The wife's reaction shows she has different values or priorities regarding spending, which the father didn't consider. \n\nAlso, the father's decision to give money without discussing it could be seen as undermining the wife's authority or their earlier agreement about the son living at home. Even if the father thinks it's fair, the lack of communication from the start might be where he went wrong. The wife might feel disrespected or that her concerns are being ignored. \n\nOn the other hand, the father's action might be seen as protecting his son from the wife's criticism. However, in a marriage, transparency is important. The father could have discussed his concerns with the wife first before taking action. So while his intentions are good, the method (keeping it a secret) might be the problem. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. But the act of not involving the spouse in financial decisions about their child is a common point of conflict in relationships. Therefore, the father might be in the wrong for not communicating with the wife first, even if his motives were to support the son and address what he saw as unfairness.\n"
