When he came back home, my wife had a go at him for spending $7 on a meal...\n\nI came back from work and she told me what happened... I said \"I will talk to him about it.\" but when I went to his room I just told him \"Don't worry about it.\"\n\nWhen I came back to the kitchen she told me \"Do you like my new perfume?\" I told her it was nice and all.. and when I asked her how much she paid for it, she said $160.. that was when I was displeased. I closed the kitchen door and said \"You just started boiling at [my son's name] for spending $7 on a meal whereas you spent $160 on your perfume, where's the fairness in that?\" she got upset and went to the bathroom.\n\nTwo weeks ago I started giving my son money without my wife's knowledge. My son isn't the type of person to spend it on drugs or some other toxins, in-fact he uses the money as a mature adult and entertains himself with food or other things every now and then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the father is in the wrong for giving his son money without the wife's knowledge.\n\nFirst, the family situation: They agreed to let their son live at home during university. The father mentions that money isn't an issue, but there's a disparity in how each family member spends. The wife criticized the son for a $7 meal, but then the father noticed she spent $160 on perfume. He confronted her, leading to tension. Then he started giving the son money secretly.\n\nNow, considering family dynamics. The wife and father might have different financial priorities. The father's action of giving money without discussing it with his wife could be seen as undermining her authority or decision-making about the son's finances. Even though the father thinks the wife is being unfair, bypassing her could create more conflict. The son is an adult, but living at home, so the parents might have shared responsibility for his expenses. If they didn't discuss this beforehand, the father's action might be seen as not respecting their agreed-upon arrangement.\n\nAlso, the wife's reaction to the $7 meal versus her own $160 perfume purchase highlights differing views on spending. The father's response was to give the son money without involving the wife, which could be seen as taking sides, potentially causing more marital issues. The key points here are communication and mutual decision-making in a marriage. If the parents haven't aligned on how to handle the son's expenses during university, the father's unilateral action might be problematic. Even if the wife's criticism seems disproportionate, the father's solution isn't collaborative, which is usually important in relationships.\n\nSo, the father's actions might be considered wrong because he didn't communicate with his wife and made a decision that affects both of them. The right approach would be to discuss with the wife first to find a solution together, rather than acting independently.\n"
