He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their best friend stay overnight after his wife died. The situation is pretty intense.\n\nFirst, the friend Jake lost his wife and is struggling. He's depressed, using drugs, and is in a bad mental state. He shows up at the author's house with his daughter. The author allows the daughter to stay but not Jake, thinking he needs to push through the pain. Then Jake ends up sleeping on the streets, which the wife finds out and criticizes the author.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they wanted to help Jake move past his grief, but the outcome was bad. Now, the user thinks the author isn't wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nHmm. Grief is a heavy topic. Let me break it down. The author's intention was to help Jake, but maybe didn't consider the immediate safety and emotional state. Jake was in a crisis, using pills, and might not be in a state to make safe decisions. By turning him away, even if he's a grown man, could have contributed to a dangerous situation. Even if the author meant well, the action led to Jake being homeless that night, which is serious.\n\nBut the author also might have thought they were pushing Jake to become independent again. However, in a state of severe depression, someone might not be capable of handling that. The author could have offered a safer alternative, like contacting a professional, a shelter, or another support system instead of just refusing. \n\nAlso, considering the daughter's presence, maybe there's a responsibility to ensure a parent isn't left in a vulnerable state. The author allowed the daughter but not Jake, which might have left Jake in a worse position. \n\nThe key points are intent vs. outcome. The author wanted to help but the method might have been flawed. Grief is complex, and sometimes people need more support, not being forced to handle it alone. So, even if the author's intention was good, the action resulted in harm. That might make the author AITA, because they didn't provide necessary support during a critical time. \n\nBut maybe there's another angle. The author might have had limits and boundaries. However, in a crisis situation, friends might need to step in more. If the author knew Jake was suicidal or at risk, they should have involved others. But they just turned him away, leading to him sleeping on the streets. That seems like a failure to provide support when it was needed most. \n\nSo, I think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong. They didn't consider Jake's immediate mental state and safety, leading to harmful consequences despite good intentions.\n"
