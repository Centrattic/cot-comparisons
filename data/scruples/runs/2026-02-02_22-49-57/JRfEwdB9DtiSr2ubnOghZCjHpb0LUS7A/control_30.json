He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong after not allowing their best friend to stay at their house after his wife died.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. Jake's wife died recently, and he's struggling with depression, drinking, and taking sleeping pills. He shows up at the author's house late at night with his daughter, asking for a place to stay. The author allows the daughter but not Jake, telling him he needs to get over it. Jake then goes to sleep on the streets, which the author's wife finds out and criticizes them for.\n\nSo, the key points here are the mental health aspect, the role of the author as a friend, and the immediate consequences. The author's reasoning is that they want to help Jake move past his grief by not giving him a place to stay. But Jake is in a vulnerable state, using sleeping pills and possibly contemplating suicide. Allowing him temporary shelter might have prevented a dangerous situation, even if the author thinks he needs to face his grief.\n\nThe author's wife calls them an asshole, which adds another layer. The author's decision might have been seen as selfish, not considering the immediate risks to Jake's well-being. Even if the intention was to help him heal, pushing him out when he's in a fragile state could be harmful. Also, Jake's daughter was with him, so maybe the author should have considered her safety too.\n\nConsidering all this, the author might be in the wrong because they prioritized their own perspective over Jake's immediate needs, potentially leading to a dangerous outcome. Even with good intentions, the action had negative consequences. Mental health crises require support, and refusing help without alternatives could be problematic. So, the answer is A.\n"
