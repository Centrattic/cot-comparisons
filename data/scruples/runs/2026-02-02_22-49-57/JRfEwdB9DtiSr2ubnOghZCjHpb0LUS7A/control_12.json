He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not letting their best friend stay over after his wife died. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. Jake's wife died, and he's really struggling. He ended up at the author's house with his daughter. The author allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake. Then Jake went to the streets. The author's wife is upset, but the author thinks they're not in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Jake is dealing with grief, which can make someone act out. The author's decision might be seen as cutting off support, leading to Jake sleeping on the streets. But the author's intention was to push Jake to get through it. \n\nI need to consider empathy here. In such situations, people in deep grief might not make rational decisions. By not letting Jake stay, the author might have inadvertently caused him to take a harmful action. Even if the intention was good, the outcome was negative. \n\nAlso, Jake's daughter's safety is important. The author allowed the daughter to stay, which is good, but Jake might have needed support. Maybe the author could have found another solution instead of refusing Jake entirely. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel they were trying to help Jake cope. However, the result was Jake being on the streets, which is dangerous. The author's approach might be too harsh given the circumstances. \n\nI think the author's refusal to let Jake stay, despite his mental state, contributed to a bad outcome. Even if the intention was to help, the action had negative consequences. So the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
