He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario (the author) is in the wrong for not allowing their best friend, Jake, to stay overnight after his wife died.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. Jake is grieving, his wife passed away, and he's struggling with depression and substance abuse. He came to the author's house in the middle of the night with his daughter, asking for a place to stay because he can't handle his home. The author allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake. Later, Jake went to sleep on the streets, and the author's wife is upset.\n\nThe key points here are: the author's intention was to help Jake get over his grief, but the consequence was Jake being out on the streets. The question is whether the author's action was wrong.\n\nI should consider empathy and support for someone in grief. Jake is in a vulnerable state, and the author, as a best friend, might have a responsibility to provide support. However, the author also has concerns about Jake's ability to handle his grief and might be trying to push him to deal with it. But refusing to let him stay could be seen as not providing adequate support, especially when he's at risk of sleeping on the streets. The author allowed the child to stay, which shows they wanted to help, but not the father might be a problem. The author's wife called them a massive asshole, which adds another layer, possibly indicating the author's decision was harsh.\n\nAlso, Jake is in a state where he's taking sleeping pills, which is concerning for his mental health. The author might not have considered the immediate safety risks. Even if the intention was good, the outcome could be harmful. The author might have a responsibility to ensure Jake's safety, even if it meant staying with him or involving others for support.\n\nSo, the author might not have been in the wrong if they thought they were helping, but the action of not letting Jake stay could be seen as neglecting his immediate needs. The right thing would be to offer help in a way that doesn't abandon him. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they didn't provide necessary support, leading to Jake being on the streets. Alternatively, some might say B (not in the wrong) if they believe the author's intention was to help Jake process his grief. However, considering the severity of the outcome, the answer is likely A.\n"
