He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for not letting their friend stay overnight. So, Jake's wife died, he's struggling a lot, and he ended up at the author's house. The author allowed his daughter to stay but not him. The friend then went home, put the kid to sleep, and slept on the streets. The author's wife is upset, but they think they're not wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Grief can make people act unpredictably. Jake is in a vulnerable state, and the author is trying to help but set a boundary. The author's reasoning was to push Jake to get through his grief. But allowing the daughter in but not the father seems contradictory. Why let the kid stay but not him? That might be seen as harsh, especially since the kid's presence could be a reason for him to stay. Also, the outcome was Jake sleeping on the streets, which is dangerous. The author didn't anticipate that consequence. \n\nOn the other hand, the author had a right to set boundaries. Maybe they felt they couldn't handle the whole family staying. But the way it was handled might not be the best. The friend felt rejected, leading to a glare and leaving. The author's intention was good, but the execution might have been flawed. Did they offer alternative support? Maybe suggest a shelter or a support group instead? \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't directly responsible for Jake's decision to sleep on the streets, but they might have a moral obligation to ensure the friend isn't left in a harmful situation. The daughter's safety is also a concern if the father can't care for her properly. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They made a tough choice but perhaps didn't consider all the consequences. Not allowing the father while letting the daughter stay could be seen as inconsistent. Also, the result was harmful. Maybe there's a middle ground, like allowing both to stay temporarily while seeking more help. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the intention was to help, but there's room for debate. However, the outcome is problematic, so maybe A. Hmm, tricky.\n"
