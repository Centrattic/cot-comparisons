He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not allowing their best friend to stay overnight. The situation is pretty intense: Jake's wife died, he's struggling with depression, and he ended up on the streets after being turned away.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of Jake's mental health. When someone is dealing with grief, especially after a traumatic event like losing a spouse, their behavior can be unpredictable. The fact that he was drinking, taking sleeping pills, and eventually sleeping outside raises concerns about his well-being and the safety of his daughter.\n\nThe author's reasoning was to help Jake get over his grief by not letting him avoid his situation. But the result was Jake being homeless, even if only temporarily. The author's wife felt they were wrong, calling the author an asshole. That's a strong reaction. \n\nNow, the key points. The author had a responsibility to their friend, especially considering Jake's mental state and the child involved. Even if the intention was good, refusing to let Jake stay might have been neglecting the immediate need for support and safety. Jake's actions\u2014taking sleeping pills, not being in his house\u2014suggest he's in a crisis. In such cases, friends might need to offer support even if it's uncomfortable. \n\nThe author could have set boundaries while still providing a safe space. For example, allowing Jake and the child to stay but discussing with a therapist or medical professional how to handle his dependency on pills. Shutting him out entirely might not have been the best approach when he was in such a vulnerable state. \n\nAlso, the daughter's safety is a concern. If Jake was putting her at risk by sleeping on the streets, the author might have a duty to step in, even if it meant involving other resources. The author's action led to Jake sleeping outside, which is dangerous for both him and his child. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intention was to help Jake face his grief, the method might have been flawed. Support during such times is crucial, especially when there's a risk of harm. Not providing a safe alternative could be seen as inconsiderate of Jake's mental health and the child's well-being. So, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
