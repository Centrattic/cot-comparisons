He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a best friend, Jake, who lost his wife and is struggling. The author (the person asking the question) didn't let Jake stay at their house after he showed up with his daughter. The author allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake, thinking it would help him get over his grief. Then Jake ended up sleeping on the streets, and the author's wife is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the circumstances. Jake is dealing with severe grief, which can make someone emotionally unstable. He's using sleeping pills, which is concerning. The author's intention was to help by not letting him avoid his situation, but the result was Jake being homeless for the night. \n\nOn one hand, the author might think that avoiding being in the house is part of the healing process. But on the other hand, denying him shelter when he's in crisis could be seen as cruel, especially since he has a child. The author allowed the child to stay, which is good, but sending the father away might leave the child vulnerable, even if the author didn't realize it. \n\nThe author's wife called them a massive asshole, which suggests emotional harm. The key here is whether the author's action was compassionate or not. While the intention was to help, the method might have been too harsh without considering Jake's current mental state. Grief can lead to impulsive and dangerous decisions, and by not offering support, the author might have contributed to Jake's decision to sleep outside. \n\nAlso, the fact that Jake was taking sleeping pills is a red flag for possible self-harm. The author should have considered that and maybe sought another solution, like calling a professional or a support group instead of just turning him away. \n\nSo, even though the author had good intentions, the outcome was negative, and the action might be seen as inconsiderate, especially when there's a risk of harm. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
