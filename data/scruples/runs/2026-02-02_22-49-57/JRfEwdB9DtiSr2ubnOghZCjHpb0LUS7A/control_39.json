He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their friend Jake stay over after his wife died. So, first, I need to look at the situation from both sides.\n\nJake's in a really tough spot. His wife just died, and he's struggling with depression, drinking, and sleeping. He asked to stay at the author's house because he can't handle being in his own home. The author allowed his daughter to stay but not him, with the reasoning that he needs to \"get over it eventually.\" Then Jake ended up sleeping on the streets, which the author's wife is upset about. The author is trying to justify their action by saying they wanted to help Jake deal with his grief.\n\nOn one hand, the author might be trying to encourage Jake to face his emotions instead of avoiding them. The intention was to help, not to abandon him. But on the other hand, Jake was in a vulnerable state, and the author's refusal might have contributed to him sleeping on the streets. Did the author have other options? Maybe they could have allowed Jake to stay but set some boundaries, or find another support system. The author's approach seems harsh, especially considering the risk of Jake putting himself in danger. \n\nAlso, the author's wife called them a massive asshole, which suggests that the action was seen as cruel. The key here is whether the author's approach was actually helping or if it was a lack of empathy during Jake's crisis. The author might have thought they were being strong, but in reality, not allowing a grieving friend to have a safe place could be seen as inconsiderate. The fact that Jake's daughter is involved adds another layer\u2014maybe the author was concerned about the child, but Jake was still responsible for her, and the author allowed the daughter to stay, which was a good move. However, turning Jake away without another option could be where the mistake happened.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. The intention was good, but the execution might have been harmful. The author should have considered other ways to support Jake instead of just refusing. Therefore, the answer is probably A (author is in the wrong) because even if the intention was to help, the action led to a negative outcome, and there might have been better ways to handle it.\n"
