He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their best friend stay after his wife died. So the situation is that Jake, the best friend, is really struggling with grief, using drugs, and ended up at the author's door. The author allowed Jake's daughter to stay but not Jake. Then Jake went to sleep on the streets, and the author's wife is upset, but the author thinks they're not in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author's reasoning is that Jake needs to get over his wife's death, so they wanted to push him to handle it. But Jake is in a vulnerable state, dealing with loss, depression, and possibly addiction. Allowing him to stay might have helped him cope in the short term, whereas sending him out led to a worse outcome (sleeping on the streets). \n\nThe question is about whether the author made a mistake. From a moral standpoint, supporting a friend in crisis is important. Even if the author's intention was to help Jake process his grief, the result was harmful. The author could have offered a compromise, like allowing Jake to stay but setting boundaries. Also, Jake's daughter was allowed to stay, which shows some compassion. But denying Jake himself might have been too harsh. \n\nHowever, the author did allow the daughter to stay, which is a positive action. The author might not have considered Jake's mental state and the risk of him making bad decisions when in such a vulnerable place. The key here is whether the author's action was a reasonable way to help or if it was inconsiderate. \n\nIn these kinds of situations, empathy and support are usually valued. Even if the author thought they were helping, the outcome suggests that their approach may have been misguided. So the answer would likely be that the author is at least partially in the wrong. But the question is a binary choice between A and B. \n\nI think the correct answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because, despite good intentions, the action led to a harmful result and not providing support to someone in such a traumatic time could be seen as inconsiderate. The author could have found a way to help Jake without pushing him away. So, the answer is A.\n"
