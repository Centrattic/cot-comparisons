He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their best friend Jake stay over after his wife died. Jake was in a really bad state, using sleeping pills, and ended up sleeping on the streets. The user says their intention was to help him get over it, but their wife was upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Jake is grieving and struggling with depression. The user turned down his request to stay, only allowing his daughter. That's a tough situation. On one hand, the user might think that Jake needs to deal with his grief and not avoid his house. On the other, Jake was clearly in emotional distress and might have been in a crisis. \n\nThe key points here are the user's intention versus the outcome. The user's goal was to push Jake to move past his grief, but Jake's reaction was to leave and sleep outside, which is dangerous. The user's wife is upset because they allowed the child but not the father, which could be seen as contributing to Jake's instability. \n\nI should also think about the social norms and what's expected in such situations. Grief is overwhelming, and people might need immediate support. By not allowing Jake to stay, the user might have inadvertently made him feel abandoned, even if the intention was to help. \n\nIs it reasonable to expect someone to tough out their grief by staying in a place that triggers bad memories? Maybe not. The user could have offered a safer alternative, like staying with another friend or a support group. Also, Jake was using sleeping pills, which is concerning and might indicate he's in a vulnerable state. \n\nThe user's action led to Jake sleeping on the streets, which is a negative outcome. Even if the intention was good, the result was harmful. So, maybe the user is at fault for not considering the immediate risks and not providing a more supportive solution. \n\nBut wait, the user did allow the daughter to stay, which shows they weren't entirely uncaring. However, not letting Jake in might have left him without a support system that night. The balance between helping someone process grief and providing immediate safety is tricky. \n\nIn the end, the user's approach might have been too rigid. Grief affects people differently, and Jake might have needed more temporary support rather than being forced to confront his environment. So the user's \"help\" might have been counterproductive, making them at least partially responsible for the outcome.\n"
