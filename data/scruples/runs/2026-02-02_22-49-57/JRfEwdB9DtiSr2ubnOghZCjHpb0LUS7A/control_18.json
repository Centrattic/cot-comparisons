He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their best friend stay over after his wife died. So, first, I need to understand the situation. The friend, Jake, is dealing with grief, and he's really struggling. He ended up showing up at the author's house at 1 AM with his daughter. The author allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake. Jake then went to sleep on the streets, and the author's wife is upset.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about empathy and support during a crisis. Grief is a really tough time, and people often need more help, not judgment. The author might think they're helping by pushing Jake to get over it, but in reality, forcing someone to sleep alone when they're in such a vulnerable state could be harmful. Jake was considering taking sleeping pills, which is a red flag. The author's decision to let the child stay but not Jake might have left Jake feeling abandoned, leading him to sleep outside. That seems pretty harsh. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might be trying to encourage independence, but in a situation like this, that approach could be counterproductive. Maybe the right move was to offer support to both Jake and his daughter, ensuring they have a safe place. The author's wife is upset, which suggests there's a conflict in perspectives here. The author might not realize how their actions affected Jake. \n\nSo, considering all that, pushing someone through grief without support is not helpful. The author's intention might have been good, but the action was harmful. Therefore, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
