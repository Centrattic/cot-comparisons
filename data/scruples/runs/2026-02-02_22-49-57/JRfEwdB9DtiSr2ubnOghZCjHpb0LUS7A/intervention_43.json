He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, their best friend Jake, and Jake's daughter. Jake's wife died, and he's struggling. The author refused to let Jake stay the night but allowed his daughter to stay. Then Jake ended up on the streets, which the author's wife found out about and was upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Jake is dealing with grief, which can make someone's behavior unpredictable. He's in a very vulnerable state. The author's intention was to help Jake get over the loss by not letting him stay, but the consequence was Jake sleeping outside, which is dangerous and possibly life-threatening. The author's wife is upset because of this outcome.\n\nThe author's decision might be seen as not considering the immediate crisis Jake is in. Even if the intention was to encourage independence, in a state of severe depression and possible suicidal thoughts (since he was taking sleeping pills), turning him away could be harmful. The author allowed the daughter to stay, which shows they were willing to help, but not Jake. Maybe the author didn't realize the severity of Jake's mental state. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might not have had the capacity to host Jake, maybe due to personal reasons or thinking that pushing him to deal with the house would help. However, in such a crisis, the immediate safety of the person is more important. The fact that Jake ended up on the streets suggests that the author's refusal might have contributed to that outcome, even if unintentionally.\n\nThe question is whether the author's action (refusing to let Jake stay) was wrong. Ethically, when someone is in crisis, especially with a child involved, the community usually has a responsibility to step in. The author might have thought they were helping by not enabling avoidance, but in reality, it might have led to a worse situation. The author's wife's reaction is also a point\u2014she called them an asshole, which indicates that others see the outcome as harmful.\n\nSo, considering all factors, even if the author had good intentions, the result was Jake being homeless, which is a serious consequence. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not providing the necessary support during a critical time.\n"
