He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. The situation is about their best friend, Jake, whose wife died a month ago. He's really struggling, using sleeping pills, and then showed up at their door in the middle of the night. The author allowed Jake's daughter to stay but not Jake himself, leading to Jake sleeping on the streets. His wife is upset, calling him an asshole, but the author thinks they're not.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Grief is a very personal experience, and Jake is clearly in a lot of pain. The author's intention was to help Jake get over his grief by not letting him avoid it. But maybe the approach was too harsh. Did the author have the right to make that decision? It's his house, so he can set boundaries. But at the same time, Jake's daughter is a child, and her safety is important. The author allowed the daughter to stay, which is good, but not Jake. However, Jake then put his daughter to sleep and left, which might have been a bad idea. The author's wife is upset, so there's a conflict in the relationship here.\n\nI should think about the potential consequences. By not letting Jake stay, he might have been pushed to a point where he couldn't cope, leading to him sleeping outside. That's risky and could have been dangerous. The author's intention was to help, but the result might have been harmful. Was there a better way to handle it? Maybe offering support but not necessarily turning him away. The author could have set a different boundary, like allowing him to stay but monitoring his use of pills, or suggesting another support system.\n\nAlso, the timing is in the middle of the night. If Jake was in a crisis, perhaps the author should have been more compassionate and let him stay, even if they thought he needed to face his grief eventually. The line between helping someone be independent and actually supporting them in a crisis can be blurry. The author might be trying to be helpful but missed the mark on empathy.\n\nSo, the author's decision wasn't malicious, but maybe the method was flawed. The key is whether they should have considered Jake's state of mind and immediate needs over their long-term goal. Sleeping on the streets is a bad outcome, and the author's action might have contributed to that. Therefore, the answer might lean towards AITA, meaning the author is in the wrong (A). However, if the author had a valid reason to not let him stay (like their own family's safety or inability to handle the situation), then maybe not. But since Jake has a child, and the author allowed the daughter but not the father, there's a risk the child was left alone. That could be a point against the author. Alternatively, maybe the author thought Jake was irresponsible with the pills and didn't want the child to be affected. \n\nBut the outcome is that Jake left the daughter alone to sleep and then went to the streets. The author's wife is upset, which adds to the problem. The author's approach might have been too abrupt. Maybe allowing Jake to stay temporarily with some support would have been better. So, considering all that, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because their action led to a harmful situation, even if the intention was good. The right choice in such a crisis might be to provide immediate support rather than enforcing a boundary that ends up putting both Jake and his daughter at risk.\n"
