He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's best friend, Jake, who's grieving the loss of his wife. The author allowed Jake's daughter to stay but not Jake himself, leading to Jake sleeping on the street. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants to know my take.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning was to help Jake get over his grief by not letting him avoid his house. But Jake ended up in a worse situation. On one hand, the author intended to be supportive by encouraging Jake to face his environment. On the other hand, not allowing him to stay might have pushed him to a breaking point, even if unintentionally.\n\nGrief can be overwhelming, and people handle it differently. The author might have thought that by not enabling avoidance, they were helping. However, not offering a safe space for both Jake and his daughter could be seen as not providing enough support. The fact that Jake's daughter was allowed to stay but he wasn't might be a point of contention. It's possible that Jake felt humiliated or unsupported, which could have led to his decision to sleep on the street.\n\nThe author's wife is upset, calling them an asshole, which suggests that there's a conflict in how support was given. The key here is whether the author's approach was considerate of Jake's emotional state. While the intention was to help, the outcome was negative. The question is whether the method was appropriate. \n\nIn some cases, setting boundaries is necessary, but when someone is in crisis, especially with a child involved, the approach might need to be more flexible. The author might not be in the wrong in terms of intent, but the execution could be seen as harmful. The answer might depend on whether the action was seen as a way to help or as a refusal to support a friend in need during a critical time.\n"
