He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their best friend, Jake, stay over after his wife died. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. Jake is struggling with grief, his wife died, he's depressed, drinking, and having a hard time caring for his daughter. He showed up at the author's house in the middle of the night with his daughter, wanting to stay. The author allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake, arguing that he needs to get over it. The next day, Jake went back to his house, put the daughter to sleep, and then slept on the streets. The wife is upset with the author.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about the author's responsibility towards a friend in crisis. The author's reasoning was to help Jake get over his wife's death by not letting him avoid his situation. But Jake is in a vulnerable state, and the author's decision might have contributed to his going to the streets. \n\nHowever, the author allowed the daughter to stay, which shows some empathy. The problem is that Jake was in a mental health crisis, and the author's refusal might not have considered the immediate need for support. Even if the author thought Jake needed to face his grief, refusing him shelter in that state could be seen as neglecting his well-being.\n\nAlso, the fact that Jake ended up on the streets is a serious consequence. The author might have thought they were doing the right thing, but not considering the potential outcomes. The friend's wife's anger makes sense because the author's action could have jeopardized the child's safety indirectly. \n\nBut the author's intention was to help Jake heal, even if the method was questionable. However, in such cases, the immediate need for support and safety might outweigh the long-term goal of facing grief. So, the author's approach might not have been the best, but is it wrong? \n\nI think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because refusing help to someone in such a vulnerable state, even with good intentions, can have serious consequences. There's a responsibility to ensure the safety of both Jake and his daughter, and the author's decision might have failed in that aspect. Proper support would involve offering help while encouraging them to face their situation, not cutting them off without alternatives.\n"
