He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for not letting their best friend stay over after his wife died. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend Jake is dealing with severe grief and depression, which is causing him to drink and sleep a lot. He's struggling to cope, and his daughter is involved too. When Jake showed up at the author's house with his daughter in the middle of the night, the author allowed the child to stay but not Jake. The author's reasoning was that Jake needed to get over it eventually. But Jake then ended up sleeping on the streets, which the author's wife criticized.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was wrong to refuse Jake. Let me consider both sides. \n\nOn one hand, the author might be trying to help by pushing Jake to face his situation, believing that staying in his home would help him move forward. The author might feel that enabling Jake by letting him stay would prevent him from dealing with his grief. However, Jake was in a vulnerable state, using sleeping pills and clearly struggling. The fact that he ended up on the streets suggests that the author's action might have inadvertently put Jake and his daughter at risk. \n\nOn the other hand, the author did allow the daughter to stay, which was a compassionate act. But refusing to let Jake stay could be seen as not supporting him during a critical time. Grief can impair judgment, and Jake might not have been in a state to make good decisions. The author's approach might be well-intentioned, but the outcome was harmful. \n\nAlso, the author's wife called them a \"massive asshole,\" which indicates that supporting the friend's immediate needs is a priority. Jake's actions (like taking sleeping pills and being emotionally unstable) suggest he might not be safe alone. By not allowing him to stay, the author might have failed to provide the necessary support, leading Jake to a worse situation. \n\nEthically, when a friend is in crisis, it's important to balance support with encouraging independence. However, in this case, the author's decision led to Jake being homeless. That outcome is severe. Maybe the right approach would have been to let Jake stay temporarily while also encouraging professional help. The author's refusal might have been too harsh without considering the immediate dangers Jake was facing. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's intentions might have been good, but the action could be seen as wrong because it didn't account for Jake's mental state and the risk of harm. The answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because their refusal without providing an alternative could be seen as neglecting their responsibility as a friend in a time of crisis.\n"
