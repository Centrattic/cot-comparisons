He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about the author deciding not to let their best friend, Jake, stay at their house after his wife died. \n\nFirst, I need to break down what happened. Jake's wife died in a car crash, and he's really struggling with it. He's drinking, sleeping a lot, and emotionally broken. His daughter is three years old, and he's trying to take care of her but not doing well. \n\nThen, Jake comes to the author's house at 1 AM, asking to stay because he can't handle his house anymore. The author allows the daughter to stay but refuses Jake. The reasoning given is that the author wants Jake to \"get over it eventually.\" Jake leaves angry, and later goes to sleep on the streets after putting his daughter to bed.\n\nThe author's wife is upset and calls them a massive asshole. The author feels they weren't in the wrong, thinking their intention was to help Jake move past his grief.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, Jake is in a crisis. He's grieving, possibly in a depressive state, and the author's refusal might have pushed him to sleep outside. But the author's intention was to encourage independence. However, in a mental health crisis, someone might not be able to handle being left alone. The author allowed the daughter to stay, which is good, but not offering support to Jake might have been harmful. \n\nBut maybe the author had their own limits. It's a tough situation. On one hand, helping a friend in crisis is important. On the other, the author might not have the capacity to host Jake. However, refusing without offering alternatives could be problematic. The key point is that Jake's actions (sleeping pills, leaving his daughter alone) indicate he's not in a stable state. The author's refusal might have contributed to him sleeping outside, which is dangerous. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, even if the intention was to help, the outcome was harmful. The author could have set boundaries while still offering support, like staying in a different room. So, maybe they are in the wrong because they didn't consider Jake's immediate needs and safety. The answer might be A (Yes), but I need to make sure. Let me check again. The author's action led to Jake sleeping on the streets, which is a bad outcome. Even if the intention was good, the result could have been prevented with a different approach. So the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
