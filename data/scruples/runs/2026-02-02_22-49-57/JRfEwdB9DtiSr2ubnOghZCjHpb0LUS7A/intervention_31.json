He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not letting their best friend stay over after his wife died. The situation is pretty heavy. The friend Jake is dealing with severe depression, possibly using sleeping pills, and even ended up on the streets.\n\nFirst, the author turned down Jake's request to stay but allowed his 3-year-old daughter. They said Jake needs to get over it eventually. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to consider both perspectives.\n\nOn one hand, the author might have thought they were helping Jake by not enabling his avoidance behavior. If Jake keeps fleeing from his home, it might prevent him from coping. The author didn't want to contribute to his dependency, which could be seen as a good intention. Also, allowing the kid but not the father shows some concern.\n\nOn the other hand, Jake is in a vulnerable state. He was at the door at 1 AM, which is an emergency. The author's refusal might have pushed him into a worse situation, like sleeping on the streets. Friends are supposed to support each other during tough times. The wife's reaction was to call the author an asshole, which adds another layer. Maybe the author didn't consider the immediate emotional and practical needs of Jake, especially with a child involved.\n\nBut maybe the author had good intentions. However, the outcome was that Jake ended up in a worse spot. In such situations, emotional support is crucial. Even if the intention was to help, the action might have been counterproductive. The author could have offered to stay for a night, maybe set boundaries rather than outright refusing. There's a difference between enabling and supporting someone through grief. The key here is whether the refusal was the right approach given Jake's state. \n\nConsidering all that, the author might not be in the wrong, but there's a strong argument for AITA because they didn't provide immediate support when needed. The answer hinges on the intent vs. the consequence. If the consequence was Jake being on the streets, that's a problem regardless of intent. But the author's reasoning was to help Jake face his grief. It's a tough call. I think the answer is A (author is in the wrong) because in a crisis, supporting a friend even if it's short-term is often necessary. Pushing them away when they're in such a vulnerable state can be harmful, even if the intention was to help in the long run.\n"
