He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a best friend, Jake, whose wife died a month ago. He's struggling, drinking, sleeping a lot, and the author refused to let him stay over, even though he came with his daughter. The author allowed the daughter but not Jake, thinking he needs to get over it. Then Jake slept on the streets, and the wife is upset with the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotional state of Jake. Grieving is a tough process, and everyone handles it differently. The author's intention was to help Jake move on, but forcing someone to stay in their traumatic environment might not be the right approach. However, refusing shelter could be seen as heartless, especially when someone is in a vulnerable state.\n\nThe key points here are empathy and practical support. The author might believe that letting Jake stay would prevent him from dealing with his grief, but in reality, when someone is in acute grief, they might need immediate support and a safe place. The author allowed the daughter but not Jake, which might have left Jake feeling abandoned. Also, Jake ended up sleeping on the streets, which is dangerous and not a solution.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did allow the daughter to stay, showing some level of support. But the refusal to let Jake stay might be seen as not providing enough help during a critical time. The author's wife called them an asshole, which suggests that there's a conflict in the household about the right approach.\n\nI should also think about mental health aspects. If Jake was considering overdosing on sleeping pills, that's a serious sign of needing help, not just being forced to stay in a triggering environment. The author's approach might have ignored the immediate need for emotional support and safety.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author had good intentions, their actions might have been harmful. The right approach might have been to find an alternative solution, like contacting other friends or family, or getting professional help, rather than refusing shelter. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
