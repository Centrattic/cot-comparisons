He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of this story is in the wrong. The situation is about a best friend, Jake, who lost his wife and is struggling. His friend (the author) initially allowed him to sleep over with his daughter but then refused when he came again, saying he needs to get over it. Now Jake is sleeping on the streets, and the author's wife called him an asshole, but the author thinks he's right.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Jake is in a very vulnerable state, dealing with the death of his wife. His actions, like taking sleeping pills and avoiding his home, are concerning. The author's intention was to help Jake move past his grief. But by not letting him stay again, maybe they pushed him too far. \n\nOn one hand, the author might think that allowing Jake to stay every time would prevent him from confronting his grief and handling it. They probably wanted to encourage independence. On the other hand, Jake was in a severe emotional crisis. The author's refusal could have been a trigger for him to take more drastic and harmful actions, like sleeping outside. \n\nThe key points here are the author's intent versus the outcome. The author's intention was to help, but the result was Jake being on the streets. However, the author did allow the daughter to stay, which is important. But Jake's mental state might mean that he needs more support, not just being told to toughen up. \n\nIf the author had a plan to help Jake deal with his home, like staying for a few days and gradually reintroducing him to it, that might be different. But just saying he can't stay because he has to get over it might not be the best approach. People in deep grief might need time and support, not pressure to move on. \n\nAlso, the fact that Jake is on the streets now is a bad outcome. Even if the author didn't mean to push him there, the action might still be seen as not supportive enough. Friends in crisis might need immediate help rather than advice to toughen up. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's approach might have been well-meaning but not appropriate. The answer might be A (in the wrong) because they didn't provide the necessary support during a severe emotional breakdown, even if their intention was to help Jake move forward. The outcome was harmful, and in such situations, immediate support is crucial.\n"
