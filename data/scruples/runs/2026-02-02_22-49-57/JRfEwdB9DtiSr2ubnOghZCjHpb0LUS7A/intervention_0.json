He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves their best friend, Jake, who's dealing with the death of his wife. The author allowed Jake's daughter to stay but not Jake himself, leading to Jake sleeping on the streets.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Jake is in a very vulnerable state after his wife's death. He's depressed, using sleeping pills, and struggling to cope. The author's intention was to help Jake move past his grief by not letting him stay, thinking he needs to get over it. But Jake ended up in a worse situation, which the author's wife is upset about.\n\nThe key points here are empathy and the practical consequences of the author's decision. While the author's intention was good, not allowing Jake to stay might have been a mistake. Jake was in a state where he needed support, and being left alone could lead to dangerous behavior. The author's action, though well-meaning, may have been too harsh without considering the immediate emotional and mental state of Jake. The daughter's presence might have been manageable if Jake had been allowed to stay as well, ensuring both his and her safety.\n\nAlso, the fact that Jake resorted to sleeping on the streets after being turned away suggests that the author's decision had unintended negative consequences. Even if the author thought they were helping, the outcome was harmful. The balance between encouraging someone to move forward and providing necessary support in a crisis is delicate. In this case, the immediate need for safety and companionship might outweigh the long-term goal of moving past grief. So, the author might be in the wrong for not considering the immediate risks and not offering full support when it was critically needed.\n"
