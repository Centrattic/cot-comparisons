He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author's best friend, Jake, lost his wife. He's really struggling, dealing with depression, and sometimes drinks or sleeps a lot. He has a 3-year-old daughter, and while he's not neglecting her, he's barely holding it together.\n\nThe key event is when Jake shows up at the author's house at 1 AM with his daughter, asking to stay for the night. The author allows the daughter to stay but refuses to let Jake stay, telling him he needs to get over it. Jake leaves angry, and later goes back to his house, puts his daughter to sleep, and then sleeps on the streets. The author's wife is upset, calling him an asshole, but the author thinks he wasn't wrong because his intention was to help Jake.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is at fault. Let's consider the arguments for both sides.\n\nOn the author's side: They were trying to help Jake by not enabling his avoidance of the situation. The author believed that allowing Jake to stay would make it easier for him to avoid his house, which is a trigger for him. The author allowed the daughter to stay, showing some compassion. The intention was to push Jake to face his grief instead of escaping it.\n\nOn the other side: Jake was in a vulnerable state after a traumatic loss. The author's refusal might have been harsh, leading Jake to sleep on the streets, which is dangerous. The author could have offered more support or alternative solutions, like staying with another friend or family member. Also, the author's wife is angry, and the author's approach might have been too rigid, not considering Jake's immediate emotional state.\n\nFactors to consider: The severity of Jake's depression, the immediate risk of leaving him alone, the availability of other support systems. The author's action might have been well-intentioned, but the outcome was Jake sleeping on the streets, which is bad. The author could have handled it more compassionately, perhaps by offering a temporary stay with clear boundaries or connecting him to professional help.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intentions but also the impact. Even if the intention was to help, the method might be flawed. The author's approach was maybe too abrupt without considering alternative support. Allowing the daughter to stay but not Jake could leave Jake in a worse situation. The author could have been more understanding of Jake's crisis state and provided support without making him feel rejected.\n"
