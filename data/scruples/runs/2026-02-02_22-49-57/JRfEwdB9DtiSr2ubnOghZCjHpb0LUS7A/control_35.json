He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their best friend Jake crash at their house after his wife died. I need to analyze this situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the context: Jake is really struggling after his wife's death. He's depressed, drinking, and having a hard time. The author offered to let Jake's daughter stay but not Jake himself. The reasoning was to help Jake get over his grief. But Jake ended up sleeping on the streets, and the author's wife is upset with them. The question is whether the author made a mistake.\n\nSo, the main points here. The author is trying to help, but their approach might have been flawed. Allowing the daughter to stay shows they care about the child's well-being, but refusing Jake could have pushed him into a worse situation. Jake was clearly in a vulnerable state, and the author's decision might not have considered the immediate emotional support he needed. \n\nGrief can be overwhelming, and sometimes people need a safe place to stay. By not allowing Jake to stay, the author might have inadvertently contributed to him retreating into isolation or worse behavior. Even if the intention was good, the outcome was negative. The author's wife thinks they're an asshole because they didn't consider the consequences of their decision. \n\nThe key here is whether the author's action was truly in Jake's best interest. While it's important to encourage someone to eventually process their grief, cutting them off completely during a crisis might not be the right approach. Maybe the author could have set boundaries while still offering a temporary refuge. For example, allowing Jake to stay for a night but encouraging him to talk or seek professional help. \n\nAlso, the fact that Jake took sleeping pills suggests he might be at risk of self-harm. The author's refusal might have removed a potential support system, leading to this. Even if they didn't know he would sleep on the streets, their response was harsh. The dirtiest glare and leaving without saying anything indicates a broken relationship moment. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author had a choice to help in a more compassionate way. The wife's criticism is valid because the action, while perhaps intending to help, caused harm. The author should have considered both the daughter and Jake's immediate needs, maybe finding another solution. \n\nSo, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because the approach was too rigid and possibly contributed to Jake's distress, even if the intention was to help him heal. They should have offered support in a way that prioritized his and his daughter's safety without pushing them away.\n"
