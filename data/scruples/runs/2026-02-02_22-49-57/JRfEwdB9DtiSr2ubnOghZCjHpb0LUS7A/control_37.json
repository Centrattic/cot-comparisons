He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question (the author) is in the wrong for not letting their best friend Jake stay over after his wife died. Jake was in a really bad state, taking sleeping pills, and ended up sleeping on the streets. The author's wife is upset and called them an asshole, but the author thinks they were just trying to help.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Jake is grieving, which is a very intense and personal experience. The author allowed his daughter to stay but not him. That seems a bit odd. Why would they separate the parent and child? Maybe the author thought it would pressure Jake to get up, but that's a bit harsh. Grief is complicated, and being separated from his child might have made it worse for him. \n\nThen there's the part where Jake says he can't stand his house because it's full of memories. The author's reasoning was to help him get over it, but forcing himself to stay in a place that triggers such pain might not be the best approach. Instead of allowing him to stay, maybe the author could have offered support in a different way. \n\nAlso, when Jake left angry and later slept on the streets, that's a concerning outcome. The author's intention was good, but the result was Jake avoiding his house and putting himself in a dangerous situation. The author's wife is upset, which adds to the tension. \n\nI should think about what's reasonable. If a friend is in crisis, even if it's a tough situation, offering a safe place might be more compassionate. The author might not have considered all the possible consequences of their decision. While they might have wanted to help, the way they handled it could be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because even though the intention was to help, the action of not allowing Jake to stay led to a worse situation. The best course during grief is usually support and understanding, not creating barriers. Also, allowing the daughter to stay but not the father might not be the most helpful strategy in this case.\n"
