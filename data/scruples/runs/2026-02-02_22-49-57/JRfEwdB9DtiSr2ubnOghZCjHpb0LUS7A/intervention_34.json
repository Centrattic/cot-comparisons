He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's best friend, Jake, lost his wife and is struggling. The friend showed up at their house with his daughter, wanting to stay the night because he couldn't handle being in his own home. The author allowed the daughter to stay but refused Jake, thinking he needed to get over his grief. The friend then ended up sleeping on the streets.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's intentions. They say their intention was to help Jake get over his wife's death. But refusing to let him stay might have led to a worse situation. Jake was in a vulnerable state, taking sleeping pills, and possibly depressed. The author's action of not allowing him to stay might have been a way to push him to deal with his grief, but it's possible that this approach was harmful.\n\nThen there's the aspect of the author's wife being upset and calling the author a massive asshole. That's a strong reaction, which suggests that maybe the author's decision caused harm in a way they didn't anticipate. Jake ended up on the streets, which is dangerous, especially if he's under the influence of pills. The author might not have considered that by refusing Jake, he would take a more extreme action.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might be trying to encourage independence and push Jake to face his emotions. However, in such a sensitive situation, the approach might need to be more compassionate. Allowing Jake to stay could have provided a safe place for him to process his grief, even if it's not the solution to his long-term issues. The key here is whether the author's refusal directly led to Jake's decision to sleep on the streets. If Jake was already in a state where he couldn't handle his home environment, the author's refusal might have been the only alternative he saw, leading to a more harmful situation.\n\nAlso, the author is a best friend, which implies a closer relationship where support is expected. The author's action might be seen as a lack of support during a critical time. Even if the intention was good, the result was Jake being left in a dangerous situation. The author could have offered a different kind of help, like suggesting a shelter, a support group, or professional help instead of just refusing to let him stay.\n\nSo weighing these factors, the author might be in the wrong because their refusal, while well-intentioned, led to a worse outcome. They didn't consider the potential consequences and didn't provide an alternative solution, which could have been more supportive. The answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because their decision, though perhaps intended to help, caused harm without adequate alternatives.\n"
