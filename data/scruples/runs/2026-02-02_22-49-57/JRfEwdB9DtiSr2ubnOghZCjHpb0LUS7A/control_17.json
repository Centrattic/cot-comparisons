He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's best friend Jake lost his wife and is really struggling. He's depressed, drinking, and sleeping a lot. His daughter is okay, but he's not doing well. Then one night, Jake shows up at their door with his daughter, asking to stay because he can't handle his house. The author allows the kid to stay but tells Jake he can't because he needs to get over it. The next day, Jake goes back to his house, puts his daughter to sleep, and then sleeps on the streets. The author's wife is upset, but the author thinks they're not wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider Jake's mental state. He's grieving, and his actions (sleeping pills, drinking) suggest he's in a bad place. When he shows up at the author's door, he's clearly in crisis. The author's decision to let the daughter stay but not Jake might have been to push him to face his grief, but maybe that's not the best approach. \n\nPutting someone in a situation where they have to go sleep on the streets after a traumatic event\u2014like losing a spouse\u2014could be seen as neglecting their immediate needs. Even if the intention was to help, the result was harmful. Jake's actions afterward (sleeping on the streets) could be a sign of desperation, maybe even a risk to his own safety and that of his daughter.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they wanted to help Jake get over his wife's death, but forcing someone to face their grief when they're not stable might not be the right approach. In times of severe grief, people might need more support, not rejection. The author's decision might have come from a good place, but the outcome was negative. The key here is whether the author had the right to make that decision, especially considering the potential for harm. Also, the daughter's safety might be a factor\u2014leaving Jake alone with her could be risky if he's not in a good mental state.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have felt they needed to set a boundary, but maybe there was a better way to handle it. Perhaps they could have offered to have Jake stay temporarily while encouraging him to seek help, rather than cutting him off abruptly. The fact that Jake's daughter was with him adds another layer\u2014her well-being is important too. If Jake left her alone to sleep on the streets, that's a concern, but the author's decision might have contributed to that scenario.\n\nIn terms of morality, sometimes in grief, people need understanding and temporary support to stabilize before they can move forward. The author's approach might have been too harsh without considering Jake's mental state. So, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because their action led to a harmful outcome, even if the intention was to help in the long term.\n"
