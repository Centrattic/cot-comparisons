He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about allowing a friend, Jake, to stay overnight after his wife's death. The author let Jake's daughter stay but not Jake himself, which led to Jake sleeping on the streets.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. Jake is dealing with depression and grief. He's not handling it well, using alcohol and sleep. He's in a fragile state. The author's decision was to only let the daughter stay, not Jake. The reasoning was to help him get over his wife's death, not to kick him out. However, Jake ended up on the streets, and the author's wife is upset.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, the intent was to push Jake to cope, but the outcome was harmful. Maybe the author should have considered other solutions instead of just saying no. Allowing Jake to stay might have provided support and prevented him from sleeping on the streets. The author's approach was harsh, even if the intention was good. The friend's actions led to a dangerous situation. The author had the means to help but chose not to, which could be seen as inconsiderate. The daughter's safety is also a factor; if Jake was in a bad state, leaving him alone might risk her too. The author's decision, while perhaps well-meaning, didn't account for the immediate needs and safety of both Jake and his daughter. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not offering full support when it was needed most.\n"
