He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation is about a best friend, Jake, whose wife died. He's struggling, became depressed, and one night showed up at the author's house with his daughter, asking to stay. The author allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake, thinking he needed to get over his grief. Jake then went to sleep on the streets, and the author's wife is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Grief is a serious mental health issue. Jake is dealing with the loss of his wife, which is a traumatic event. He's showing signs of depression and self-harm (using sleeping pills). The author's intention was to help by pushing Jake to cope, but refusing to let him stay might have had unintended consequences.\n\nThe key points here are: Jake's mental state, the author's decision to not let him stay, and the outcome where Jake sleeps on the streets. The author might have thought they were helping by encouraging independence, but refusing shelter could be seen as neglecting immediate emotional support. Also, there's the aspect of Jake's daughter being present. The author allowed the daughter but not the father, which might be considered separating a parent from their child, which is a big issue.\n\nHowever, the author might argue they were trying to prevent enabling bad behavior. But in a crisis, people might need more support. The author's wife is upset, which adds to the conflict. There's a balance between helping someone through grief and pushing them towards independence. The fact that Jake ended up on the streets suggests the author's approach didn't account for Jake's current capacity to cope.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might not have the responsibility to provide long-term housing. But in a moment of crisis, maybe the immediate need is safety. The author could have considered other options, like staying in contact, offering temporary help, or suggesting professional support. Refusing entry without alternatives might not be the best approach.\n\nIn terms of social norms, friends often support each other in times of need. The author's refusal could be seen as uncaring, especially when someone is in a vulnerable state. Even if the intention was good, the outcome was harmful. So, the author's actions might be considered wrong because they didn't provide necessary support, leading to Jake being homeless for the night. The answer might lean towards A (in the wrong) because the immediate need for shelter and support wasn't addressed adequately.\n"
