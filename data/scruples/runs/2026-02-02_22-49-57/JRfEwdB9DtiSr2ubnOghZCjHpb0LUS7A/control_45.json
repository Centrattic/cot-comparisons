He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that their best friend, Jake, lost his wife and is struggling. He came to their house for help, but the author only allowed his daughter to stay, not Jake himself. The friend ended up sleeping on the streets, and the author's wife is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Grief can be really overwhelming. Jake is dealing with a recent loss, which is a traumatic event. He might be in a state of depression or crisis. When he approached the author, he was clearly in distress. The author's reasoning was to help Jake get over his grief by not letting him avoid his home, so he could process the loss. But Jake's reaction was a glare and leaving, which suggests he felt rejected or humiliated.\n\nThe author's intention was to help, but the result was Jake being homeless for the night. The question is whether the author should have allowed Jake to stay. On one hand, the author's approach might be seen as tough love, trying to push Jake to face his situation. On the other hand, Jake was in a vulnerable state, and refusing him shelter when he was in crisis could be seen as not supporting a friend in need. Especially since Jake's daughter was allowed to stay, it might have been possible to offer Jake some support too, perhaps with boundaries but still.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that Jake was taking sleeping pills, which could indicate self-harm risk. If the author knew this, maybe there's a duty to ensure his safety. The author might have acted in a way that prioritized their own beliefs about moving on from grief but didn't consider the immediate mental health crisis Jake was facing.\n\nIn terms of social norms, being a good friend during a crisis often involves providing support, even if it's challenging. While the author's intention was to help Jake move past his grief, the method might have been too harsh given the circumstances. The outcome of Jake sleeping on the streets suggests that the author's approach didn't account for the immediate need for safety and emotional support.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't provide necessary support to a grieving friend who was in a crisis, even if their intention was to help in the long run. The key here is balancing the intention with the immediate needs and the consequences of their actions.\n"
