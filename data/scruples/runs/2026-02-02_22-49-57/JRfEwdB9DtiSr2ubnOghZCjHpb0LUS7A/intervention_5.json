He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for not letting their best friend, Jake, stay overnight after his wife died. The author allowed Jake's daughter to stay but told Jake he couldn't. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Jake is clearly in a very vulnerable state after the loss, and he's turning to destructive behaviors like drinking and sleeping pills. The author's intention was to help Jake get over his grief by not letting him avoid his home. But Jake ended up sleeping on the streets, which is dangerous, especially for a parent who's responsible for a young child.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that Jake needs to face his environment and not use it as an excuse to stay away. But maybe they didn't think about the immediate consequences. If Jake was in a state where he might hurt himself or not be able to care for his daughter properly, the author's decision could be seen as not providing necessary support. On the other hand, the author did allow the daughter to stay, which shows they were trying to be helpful. \n\nHowever, the problem is that by not letting Jake stay, the daughter was left alone with him at home, and Jake ended up sleeping outside. That's risky. The author might have thought they were helping by pushing Jake to deal with his grief, but maybe they should have considered offering a safer alternative. For example, perhaps they could have let Jake stay but set boundaries, like no pills. \n\nAlso, the way Jake reacted\u2014glaring and leaving without a word\u2014might have been emotional, but the author's responsibility as a friend is to support, not to make decisions that could lead to dangerous situations. The wife's reaction of calling the author an asshole might be valid because Jake's actions after being refused could have endangered both him and his daughter. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author had good intentions, not allowing Jake to stay might have been a mistake. The right thing would have been to ensure both Jake and his daughter were safe, even if it meant setting some conditions for Jake's stay. So the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
