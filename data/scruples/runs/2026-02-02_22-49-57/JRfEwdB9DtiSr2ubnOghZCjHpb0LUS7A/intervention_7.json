He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves their best friend, Jake, whose wife recently died. Jake is struggling, and after a breakdown, he shows up at the author's house with his daughter. The author allows the daughter to stay but not Jake, leading to Jake sleeping on the streets.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Grief can be overwhelming, and Jake's actions suggest he's in a very vulnerable state. The author's decision to deny Jake but allow his daughter might be seen as trying to help him become independent, but there's a risk here. If Jake is suicidal or in a mental health crisis, simply sending him away without support could be dangerous. \n\nThe key points here are Jake's mental state, the presence of his young daughter, and the author's responsibility as a friend. The author might believe they're encouraging Jake to face his grief, but forcing a grieving person to cope alone, especially when they're at risk of self-harm, could be harmful. The author didn't offer any alternative help or resources, which might be a critical oversight. \n\nAlso, the wife's reaction is mentioned, calling the author an asshole, which implies she sees the action as cruel. Friends often expect support during tough times, and turning someone away during a crisis, even with good intentions, might not be the right approach. The author's intention was to help, but the execution might have been lacking in empathy and practical support.\n\nHowever, the author did allow the daughter to stay, showing some level of compassion. But Jake's situation is dire, and the author's refusal without providing another solution could be seen as neglecting a friend in need. Mental health crises often require professional intervention, and the author might not have the capacity to provide that, but leaving Jake on the streets without any help is a problem.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, friends should support each other, especially in times of crisis. The author's action might be perceived as not providing necessary support, even if the intention was to push Jake to cope. The outcome\u2014Jake sleeping on the streets\u2014was unintended, but the lack of follow-up or alternative arrangements could be a mistake.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't offer adequate support to a friend in a vulnerable state, leading to a potentially dangerous situation. Even with good intentions, the action lacked compassion and practical help. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
