He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not allowing their best friend to crash at their house after his wife died. The situation is pretty heavy. So, Jake, the best friend, is really struggling after losing his wife. He's depressed, drinking, and not handling things well. He shows up at the author's house in the middle of the night with his 3-year-old daughter, asking for shelter. The author allows the daughter to stay but not Jake. Jake then goes to sleep on the streets.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but they're curious for another perspective. Let's break it down. First, the emotional aspect: Jake is in a vulnerable state. Losing a spouse is traumatic, and he's trying to cope. The author's reasoning is that Jake needs to get over it, so by not letting him stay, they're pushing him to face his grief. But is that the right approach?\n\nOn the other hand, the author could have considered that Jake might not be in a position to make rational decisions. He might be in a crisis, and the author's refusal without offering alternatives could have led to him sleeping outside. The daughter staying is a good move, but not allowing Jake could be seen as cruel, especially under these circumstances. The wife called the author an asshole, which suggests that there's a family perspective that this was harsh.\n\nThe key points here are empathy, support during a crisis, and the practicality of the situation. While the author might have good intentions, the action of refusing shelter without providing another solution could be harmful. Jake might need immediate help, not just a lesson in coping. The fact that he then sleeps on the streets is a direct consequence of the author's decision, which could be viewed as neglecting his responsibility as a friend during a time of need.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a tough call. They might not be intentionally malicious, but the outcome is that Jake is left in a worse situation. The right action might have been to allow him to stay but set boundaries, or at least help him find another place to stay. The author's intention was to help him get over the loss, but their method might have been counterproductive and unkind. Therefore, the answer might lean towards AITA (they are in the wrong).\n"
