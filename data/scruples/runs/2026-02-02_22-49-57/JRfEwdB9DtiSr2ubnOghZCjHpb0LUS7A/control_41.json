He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their best friend, Jake, stay at their house after his wife's death. So, the situation is Jake's wife died in a car crash a month ago. He's been struggling a lot, dealing with depression, drinking, and sleeping. He has a 3-year-old daughter, and while he's not neglecting her, he's clearly not doing well.\n\nThen, a few days ago, Jake says he can't stand being in his house and takes sleeping pills. The next night, he shows up at the author's house at 1 AM with his daughter, asking to stay. The author allows the daughter to stay but refuses Jake, saying he needs to get over it. Jake reacts with a dirty glare and leaves. The next day, it turns out Jake went back home, put the daughter to sleep, then slept on the streets. The author's wife is upset and called them an asshole, but the author thinks they're not at fault because their intention was to help him move past the grief.\n\nHmm. Let me break this down. The key points here are the author's refusal and the consequences. The author's reasoning is that they wanted to help Jake get over his wife's death by not letting him stay, implying he needs to be independent. But Jake's reaction and the outcome (sleeping on the streets) suggest that the refusal might have pushed him into a worse situation. \n\nFirst, I should consider the context of grief and mental health. When someone is in deep grief, especially with depression and possible substance abuse, they might need support more than ever. The author's decision might be seen as cutting off a potential support system. Jake's actions of taking sleeping pills and then ending up on the streets could indicate he's in a crisis. By not allowing him to stay, the author might have inadvertently contributed to his current state, which is dangerous. \n\nAlso, the fact that Jake brought his daughter along might mean he was trying to keep her safe, but he left her at home before going to the streets. The author allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake. That could be a problem because Jake might need to be with his child for emotional support, or at least, the daughter's presence might have made it easier for Jake to cope. \n\nThe author's intention is important here. They might have thought they were encouraging Jake to handle his grief alone, but in reality, when someone is in such a fragile state, being alone could lead to harmful behaviors. The author's action might be well-meaning, but the result is that Jake is now without shelter and possibly without someone to take care of him. The author's wife is upset because maybe she sees the immediate harm, whereas the author is focused on the long-term goal of helping Jake move on. \n\nBut is it right to prioritize long-term help over immediate safety? If Jake is self-harming or in a state where he can't take care of himself, maybe the immediate need is to ensure his safety. The author's approach of saying \"you need to get over it\" might be dismissive of Jake's current emotional state. Grief isn't something you just \"get over\" quickly. It's a process, and sometimes people need time and support, even if it's not what they think is best for their friend's long-term healing. \n\nAdditionally, the author's wife called them an asshole, which is a strong reaction, but it's from a position of seeing the immediate consequence. The author's refusal could be seen as a lack of empathy. Even if the intention was good, the action might have been hurtful and contributed to Jake's current situation. \n\nI should also consider if there's a middle ground. Maybe the author could have allowed Jake to stay but set some boundaries to encourage him to process the grief. For example, suggesting a time limit or offering support while staying at his place. But in this case, the author didn't allow any stay at all. \n\nAnother angle: Jake might have genuinely needed a safe place to be, and the author's home was the only place available. By turning him away, despite the intention to push him to cope, the author left him to sleep on the streets, which is risky and not a safe environment. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's decision, while possibly intended to be helpful, might have been harmful in practice. The immediate well-being and safety of a grieving friend, especially when he's showing signs of self-harm, should be a priority. Therefore, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
