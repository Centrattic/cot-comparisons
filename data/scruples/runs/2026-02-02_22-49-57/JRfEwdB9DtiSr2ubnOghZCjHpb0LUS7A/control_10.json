He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by understanding the situation. The user's best friend, Jake, lost his wife in a car crash a month ago. He's really struggling, dealing with depression, drinking, and sleeping a lot. His three-year-old daughter is okay, but he's not doing well. \n\nJake told the user he can't be in his house because it reminds him of his wife and he's taking sleeping pills. Then one night, Jake shows up at the user's door with his daughter, asking to stay. The user allows the daughter to stay but not Jake, saying he needs to get over it. Jake leaves angry, and later the user finds out Jake went back home, put the kid to sleep, then slept on the streets. The user's wife is upset, but the user thinks they're not in the wrong.\n\nSo the question is, AITA (Am I the Asshole)? The user is asking if they're in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I should consider the context. Jake is in a severe emotional crisis. Grief can make people act irrationally. He's not just sad; he's depressed, using sleeping pills, and not handling it well. The user's response was to let the child stay but not Jake. Maybe they thought Jake needed to face reality? But sending him to sleep on the streets after he's already in a fragile state might be harmful. \n\nThe user's intention was to help Jake move past his grief, but their action might have been too harsh. Jake's mental health is critical here. If Jake is at risk of self-harm (he mentioned taking sleeping pills, which could be a suicide risk), then the user's refusal might have contributed to a dangerous situation. \n\nOn the other hand, the user might have felt that Jake needed to take responsibility for his own recovery. However, in a crisis, friends often step in to provide support. The user allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake, which could leave him without a safe place. Jake might have felt rejected and chose the streets, which is worse than staying with the user. \n\nThe user's wife is upset, which suggests there's a conflict in their household about how to handle the situation. The user's reasoning is that Jake needs to get over it, but grief isn't something you just \"get over.\" It's a process. Denying him shelter, even temporarily, could be seen as not supporting him through this time. \n\nAlso, Jake's actions (sleeping on the streets) might indicate that he's in a state where he's not thinking clearly. If the user had let him stay, maybe they could have ensured his safety and offered support. But the user's reasoning was that he needed to \"get over it,\" which might not be the right approach. \n\nI think the key here is whether the user's action was the right way to help Jake. Even if the intention was good, the outcome was Jake being homeless and potentially in danger. The user might have a point in wanting Jake to face his grief, but the method was harmful. In such critical moments, immediate safety and support are more important than pushing someone to move on. So, the user's action might be seen as not supporting their friend when he needed it most. Therefore, the answer would be A, the user is in the wrong.\n"
