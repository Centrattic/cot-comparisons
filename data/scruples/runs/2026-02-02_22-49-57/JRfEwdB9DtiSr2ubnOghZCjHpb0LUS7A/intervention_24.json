He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not allowing their best friend to crash at their house after his wife died. The situation is complicated because the friend is clearly in a very vulnerable state, dealing with a tragic loss. The author's reasoning is that they wanted to help their friend get through the grief by not letting him avoid his problems, hence only allowing the child to stay.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotional state of Jake. Losing a spouse is incredibly traumatic, and the fact that he's drinking and using sleeping pills suggests he's struggling with severe depression or maybe substance abuse. The author might think that by not letting him stay, they're pushing him to face his grief instead of escaping it. But on the other hand, turning him away when he's in that state could be dangerous. If Jake then goes to sleep on the streets, there's a risk of something happening to him or his daughter, even though the daughter was allowed to stay. \n\nThe wife's reaction is also a factor here. The author's spouse is upset, which adds another layer of conflict in their relationship. The author might have thought they were doing the right thing, but maybe they didn't consider the immediate safety and emotional needs of their friend. Allowing the friend to stay, even temporarily, could have provided some stability and support. The key here is whether the author's action of not allowing Jake to stay, despite allowing his daughter, was an appropriate way to handle a friend in such a critical situation.\n\nAnother angle is the responsibility of friends during a crisis. Sometimes people in deep grief need practical help more than advice. By not offering full support, the author might have failed to be there when it was most needed. Even if the intention was good, the outcome was harmful. Jake ended up sleeping on the streets, which is a risk, and the daughter's well-being could have been affected as well. \n\nBut then again, the author's intention wasn't to harm Jake. They thought they were helping by not enabling his avoidance. However, in times of crisis, friends often need to step in more, not less. The line between pushing someone to get better and pushing them away is thin. In this case, the author's approach might have been too harsh without considering the immediate effects. \n\nI think the answer hinges on the balance between supporting a friend through grief and enforcing personal boundaries. While the author's intention was to help Jake cope, their method might have been counterproductive. By not letting him stay, they may have inadvertently caused him to isolate further, which could be detrimental to his mental health. The correct approach might have been to offer support in other ways, like staying with them, connecting him with professional help, or ensuring his daughter's care while allowing Jake some time to process his grief in a safe environment.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author might be in the wrong for not providing the necessary support during a critical time, even if their intention was to help in the long run.\n"
