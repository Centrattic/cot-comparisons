He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the Reddit-style question is in the wrong for not letting their friend Jake crash at their house after his wife died. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: Jake's wife died recently, and he's struggling with depression, drinking, and sleep issues. He asked to stay at the author's house for the night, but the author only allowed his daughter. Jake then went back home, put the kid to sleep, and slept on the streets. The author's wife is upset, but they think they're justified because they wanted to help him move on from his grief.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about grief, friendship, and support. When someone is in deep grief, their behavior can be unpredictable. Jake is clearly in a fragile state. The author's reasoning is that Jake needs to \"get over it eventually,\" but that might not be the right approach. Grief isn't something you just \"get over\"; it's a process. By not allowing Jake to stay, the author might have inadvertently caused him to take drastic, potentially dangerous actions.\n\nAlso, the author allowed the daughter to stay, which is good, but didn't extend the same hospitality to Jake. Maybe the author felt they couldn't handle another person in their home, especially if Jake was drinking or acting out. But considering the circumstances, a friend in such a state might need more support, not just being told to toughen up. The author might not have realized how severe Jake's emotional state was. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might have their own limits and boundaries. Maybe they were trying to push Jake to face his reality, thinking that avoiding his house would help him heal. However, the consequence of Jake sleeping on the streets is extremely concerning. The author didn't consider that their action could lead to Jake making a harmful decision. \n\nThe wife's reaction suggests that the author's action was harsh. Friends in crisis need empathy and support. Even if the author didn't want Jake staying, maybe they could have offered a different solution, like connecting him with a support group, a shelter, or professional help. Turning him away without alternatives could be seen as neglecting their responsibility as a friend. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author's action was wrong. The answer hinges on balancing boundaries with compassion. While it's okay to have limits, in a situation like this, where someone is at risk of self-harm, the appropriate response would be to ensure their safety. The author's refusal without providing an alternative might be considered inconsiderate, especially when it led to Jake being on the streets. Therefore, the author might be at fault for not considering the potential consequences of their decision.\n"
