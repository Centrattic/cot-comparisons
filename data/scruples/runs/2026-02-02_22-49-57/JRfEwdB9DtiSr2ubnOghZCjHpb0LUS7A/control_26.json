He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is at fault (AITA) for not letting his friend Jake stay over after his wife's death.\n\nFirst, the context: Jake's wife died a month ago in a car crash. He's struggling, either drinking or sleeping, and isn't neglecting his 3-year-old daughter but is barely holding on. He went to the author's house at 1 AM with his daughter, asking to stay because he couldn't handle his home. The author allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake, telling him he needs to get over it. Jake left angry, then later went to sleep on the street after putting his daughter to sleep. The author's wife is upset, but the author thinks they weren't wrong.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nOn one hand, the author's intention was to help Jake move past his grief. They might have thought that staying in his own house is part of the healing process. Also, the author might not have considered the immediate consequences of turning Jake away. On the other hand, Jake was in a vulnerable state, actively struggling with depression and possibly considering self-harm (taking sleeping pills). The author allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake, which might have left Jake in a dangerous situation. \n\nThe key points here are: Jake's mental health is deteriorating, he was seeking help by coming to the author's house, the author's response might not have addressed the immediate crisis, and Jake ended up sleeping on the streets. The author's decision could have led to unintended harm. \n\nEven if the author's intention was good, not allowing him to stay might have been a failure to support a friend in crisis. The author's wife is upset because they didn't consider the consequences. While it's important to encourage someone to heal, in a crisis situation, immediate support is crucial. The author might have been too focused on the long-term goal of Jake moving past grief and not enough on his current mental state. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author probably is at fault for not providing the necessary support when Jake needed it most. Even if they didn't mean to, their action led to Jake being in a worse situation. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
