He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is at fault for not letting their best friend stay over after his wife died. \n\nFirst, the context is that Jake is dealing with severe grief, depression, and substance abuse. He shows up unannounced at the author's house with his daughter, asking for a place to stay. The author allowed the child to stay but refused Jake, thinking it would help him move past his grief. However, Jake ended up sleeping on the streets, which led to the author's wife being upset.\n\nNow, considering the emotional state of Jake, his mental health is a significant factor here. Grief can impair judgment and lead to harmful decisions. By not allowing Jake to stay, the author might have inadvertently put him in a dangerous situation. The author's intention was to encourage independence, but the outcome was harmful.\n\nThe key points here are the author's responsibility towards a friend in crisis and the potential consequences of their actions. While the author might have had good intentions, the immediate need for Jake was support and safety. The fact that Jake resorted to sleeping on the streets after being turned away suggests that the author's decision lacked compassion and understanding of Jake's mental state.\n\nAdditionally, the author's wife's reaction highlights the personal conflict in the situation. The author's approach might have been too rigid, not considering that Jake needed more immediate help rather than advice. There's a balance between supporting someone and pushing them towards independence, especially in a crisis.\n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, helping a friend in distress is generally seen as a moral duty, especially when their actions could lead to self-harm. The author's refusal, even if well-intentioned, might be viewed as neglecting the immediate need for support. The outcome where Jake is in a dangerous situation due to the refusal adds weight to the argument that the author is at fault.\n\nHowever, the author's perspective is that they wanted to help Jake move past his grief, which is a valid long-term goal. But in an emotional crisis, short-term safety and support are crucial. The author might not have considered alternatives, like ensuring Jake had a safe place to stay elsewhere or involving other resources like support groups or crisis services.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author had intentions of helping Jake become stronger, the immediate consequence was harmful. The lack of compassion and potential negligence in a time of crisis makes the author at fault.\n"
