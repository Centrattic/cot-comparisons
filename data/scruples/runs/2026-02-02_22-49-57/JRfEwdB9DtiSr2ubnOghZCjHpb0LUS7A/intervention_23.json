He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for not letting his best friend stay at his house after his wife died. The situation is pretty sensitive. The friend, Jake, is clearly struggling with grief and depression. He showed up unannounced in the middle of the night with his daughter, and the author allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake. Jake then went to sleep on the streets.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotional state of Jake. He just lost his wife, and he's handling it poorly. The author's intention was to help him move past the grief, but the method might have been harsh. The author allowed the daughter to stay, which shows some compassion, but refusing Jake seems cold. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that Jake needs to get over it. However, in a state of deep depression, someone might not be able to cope on their own. By sending him out, the author might have inadvertently put Jake at risk, especially since he was already considering sleeping pills. The fact that Jake went to the streets is a bad outcome, which the author didn't intend but could have foreseen the consequences.\n\nThen there's the wife's reaction, calling the author an asshole. That adds another layer. The author might have thought they were acting in Jake's best interest, but their approach could have been more supportive. Maybe the author should have offered help in another way, like staying with Jake for the night or contacting other resources instead of just saying no. \n\nOn the other hand, the author did allow the daughter to stay, showing they care about the child. But the way they handled Jake's situation might have been too abrupt. There's a difference between wanting someone to be strong and pushing them when they're not ready. The author's actions might have come off as insensitive, even if the intention was good.\n\nI think the key points are the mental state of Jake, the unintended consequence of him sleeping outside, and whether there was a better way to handle it. The author's intention wasn't to harm Jake, but the action might have been too harsh given Jake's fragile condition. So, the answer might lean towards A (author is in the wrong) because the refusal contributed to a dangerous situation, even if unintended.\n"
