He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves their best friend, Jake, who lost his wife and is struggling. The author refused to let Jake stay at their house but offered to let his daughter stay. Jake then ended up sleeping on the streets.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. Jake is in a lot of emotional pain, and the author's decision to not let him stay might be seen as cold-hearted, especially given the circumstances. However, the author's reasoning was to help Jake overcome his grief, not to abandon him. But the consequence was that Jake ended up on the streets, which is a bad outcome. \n\nI should consider intentions vs. outcomes. The author's intention was good\u2014trying to encourage independence. But the outcome was harmful. Did the author have other options? Maybe they could have set boundaries but still offered alternative support, like helping him find a shelter or connecting him with community resources. \n\nAlso, the author's wife criticized them, which might indicate a social perspective that sees the action as heartless. But the author's own perspective is that they were trying to help. However, in times of crisis, people need support, not rejection, even if it's meant to be for their own good. \n\nAnother angle: Jake was in a vulnerable state. The author might have a responsibility as a friend to provide safety, even if it means allowing him to stay temporarily, while addressing the sleeping pills issue. The author's refusal might have pushed Jake into a worse situation. \n\nSo, balancing all this, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the immediate safety and emotional needs of Jake and his daughter. Even if the intention was to help, the action didn't address the immediate crisis. The right approach might have been to allow Jake to stay but also encourage professional help or other support systems. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
