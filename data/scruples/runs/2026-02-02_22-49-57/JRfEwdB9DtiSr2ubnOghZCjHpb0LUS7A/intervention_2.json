He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not allowing their best friend, Jake, to crash at their house after Jake's wife died. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. Jake is struggling with grief, using drugs, and is in a bad state. He shows up unannounced at the author's house with his daughter. The author allows the daughter to stay but refuses Jake. Later, Jake ends up on the streets, and the wife is upset with the author.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong. But maybe there's more to consider here. The author's reasoning is that they wanted to help Jake get over his grief by not enabling his avoidance. But Jake's actions also show that he might be in a mental health crisis, possibly needing more support than just being told to \"get over it.\"\n\nIs the author's approach compassionate? Maybe not. While the intention was to help, the method could have been lacking. Turning someone away during a mental health crisis, especially when they're in a vulnerable state, might be seen as inconsiderate. Even if the author didn't want to enable Jake's avoidance, there should be alternative support measures, like suggesting professional help or connecting him with community resources. \n\nAlso, Jake's daughter being present complicates things. The father's instability could affect the child's well-being. The author allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake, which might have left the child without proper care. The wife's anger is understandable because the outcome was that Jake went to the streets, which is dangerous, especially with a child involved. \n\nThe key factors here are: the severity of Jake's mental health state, the potential for harm if left without support, and the availability of other resources. The author might have a point in wanting Jake to confront his grief, but in a crisis situation, practical support is often necessary first. \n\nSo, while the author's intention might be good, the action of refusing to let Jake stay without providing alternatives could be seen as inconsiderate and harmful. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not offering sufficient support during a critical time.\n"
