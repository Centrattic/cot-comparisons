He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's best friend, Jake, lost his wife and is really struggling. He came to the author's house at 1 AM with his daughter, asking to stay. The author said the daughter could stay but not Jake. Then Jake left and later ended up sleeping on the streets, which the author's wife found out and called him a jerk.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's reasoning. He thought he was helping by not letting Jake stay, to push him to get over his grief. But is that the right approach? Let's break it down.\n\nJake is in a very vulnerable state. He's grieving, using alcohol, and taking sleeping pills. His daughter is involved, so there's a responsibility to take care of her. The author allowed the daughter to stay, which is good, but refused Jake. The problem is that Jake then ended up on the streets. The author might not have intended for that to happen, but the outcome is negative.\n\nIs it reasonable to expect someone in such a state to handle this on their own? Probably not. Grief can impair judgment, and the author's friend might have not been in a place to make rational decisions. By not offering full support, the author might have contributed to Jake's decision to sleep outside. Also, the daughter is only 3, so even if Jake is doing okay with her, he might need support to take care of her properly.\n\nThe author's wife is upset, which suggests that the action taken was harsh. The author's intention was good, but the method might have been too harsh. In such situations, it's important to provide support rather than pushing someone towards a crisis. Maybe the author could have found a compromise, like letting Jake stay but also talking him through it, instead of just saying no and risking him making a bad decision.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have felt that they needed to encourage independence. But given the circumstances, that might not have been the best approach. The key here is that the author's action led to an unintended but harmful outcome. So, even if the intention wasn't malicious, the result was Jake being on the streets, which is bad. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not considering the potential consequences and not providing necessary support to a grieving friend.\n"
