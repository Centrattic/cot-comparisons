He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not letting their best friend stay over after his wife died. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend, Jake, is struggling with grief, depression, and possibly alcohol. He showed up at their house in the middle of the night with his daughter, asking to stay. The author offered to let the daughter stay but not Jake. Jake then went to sleep on the street, and the author's wife is upset, but the author thinks they're not at fault.\n\nThe question is whether the author (the person sharing the story) is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nI need to consider the context. The author's intention was to help Jake get over his grief, but their approach might have been too harsh. Jake was in a fragile mental state, possibly suicidal with the mention of sleeping pills. Turning him away, even if it was to help him be independent, might have been a bad idea given his mental health crisis. The author could have offered an alternative, like getting him to a shelter or calling a crisis line instead of just saying he can't stay. \n\nBut the author did allow the child to stay, which shows they were trying to help. However, the way they handled it might have been insensitivity. Maybe they should have considered his emotional state more and found another solution. But the key is whether they were in the wrong. The author's action led to Jake sleeping on the street, which is dangerous. So maybe they are in the wrong for not considering the consequences of their decision. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might not be responsible for Jake's choice to leave. If Jake refused the offer to have the daughter stay but he couldn't, and then made the decision to go to the streets, the author isn't directly responsible. However, given the circumstances, the author could have done more to ensure Jake's safety, like offering to help him find a shelter or calling someone. \n\nThe answer might depend on cultural or personal values. Some might think the author was right to push Jake to handle it, others might think they were too harsh. The mention of Jake being a \"complete mess\" and using sleeping pills suggests a crisis. In such cases, the appropriate action might be to ensure he gets help rather than just turning him away. \n\nSo, considering all that, maybe the author is in the wrong (A) because they didn't provide adequate support and their action had negative consequences. Alternatively, if Jake made the choice to go to the street despite the offer for his daughter, the author might not be responsible. \n\nBut since the author's intention was to help but the method could have been better, the answer might be A. But I'm a bit torn. The key point is whether the author's actions were reasonable given the circumstances. The author's wife is upset, but maybe the author is right in the long run. However, the immediate harm caused by Jake sleeping on the street is a problem. \n\nI think the answer leans towards A because the author could have been more supportive and found a safer solution. They should have considered Jake's mental state and offered help beyond just turning him away. So the answer is A.\n"
