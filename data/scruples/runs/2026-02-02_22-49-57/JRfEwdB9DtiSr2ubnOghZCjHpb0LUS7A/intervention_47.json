He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that Jake, the author's best friend, lost his wife and is really struggling. He came to the author's house at 1 AM with his daughter, asking to stay because he can't handle his own house. The author allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake. Then Jake ended up sleeping on the streets, which caused the author's wife to be upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's reasoning. They said their intention was to help Jake get over his wife's death by not letting him avoid his problems. But is pushing someone to face their grief immediately the right approach? Grief is complex, and people cope differently. Denying someone a safe place to stay, especially after a traumatic event, might not be helpful. However, the author did allow the child to stay, which shows some consideration.\n\nOn the other hand, Jake's actions are concerning\u2014using sleeping pills and avoiding his house. The author might be trying to prevent enabling destructive behavior. But by not letting Jake stay, they may have inadvertently caused him to end up on the streets, which is dangerous, especially with a child involved. The line between helping and pushing too hard is thin here.\n\nAlso, the author's wife is upset, indicating that there's a conflict in their household. The author might not have considered all the possible consequences of their decision. Maybe there was a better way to handle it, like offering support while ensuring both Jake and his daughter are safe. \n\nSo, the key points are: the author's intent to help, the method used, and the outcome. Even if the intent was good, the outcome was harmful. Is the author responsible for not anticipating that Jake might sleep on the streets? Possibly. But maybe there's more to the story. Did the author offer any alternatives? The scenario doesn't mention that. If the author refused without providing another solution, that could be problematic. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's intention was to help Jake cope, the way it was handled might have been too harsh without considering safer alternatives. Therefore, the answer might lean towards AITA being the author.\n"
