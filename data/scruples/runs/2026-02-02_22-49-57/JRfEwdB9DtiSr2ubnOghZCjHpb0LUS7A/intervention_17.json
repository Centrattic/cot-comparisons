He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The situation is about whether the author is at fault for not letting his friend, Jake, stay at his house after his wife's death. So, the author's friend Jake is going through a tough time, with depression and possibly suicidal thoughts. He showed up at the author's house with his daughter, and the author allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake. Then Jake ended up sleeping on the streets, which made the author's wife upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Jake is in a vulnerable state. After losing his wife, he's struggling, using sleeping pills, and avoiding his house. The author's decision not to let Jake in might have been based on the belief that Jake needs to face his grief and not rely on others. But on the other hand, there's a risk that Jake could harm himself, especially since he mentioned taking sleeping pills to sleep. The author's wife is upset because he might have contributed to Jake sleeping outside, which could be dangerous.\n\nThe question is whether the author acted wrongly. On one side, the author might have thought he was helping by pushing Jake to handle his own problems. On the other, refusing shelter could be seen as not providing necessary support, especially considering Jake's mental state and the presence of his child. The author allowed the daughter but not Jake, which might have left Jake without a place, leading to him sleeping on the streets. That outcome could be considered neglecting potential risks, even if the intention was to help.\n\nAlso, the author's wife is upset, and there's a social expectation to support friends in crisis. The decision to not let Jake stay might not take into account the immediate danger he's in. Even if the intention was good, the result could be harmful. So, there's a conflict between the intention to help and the actual consequences. \n\nIn such cases, the rightness or wrongness can depend on both intent and outcome. If the author's action led to a dangerous situation for Jake, even unintentionally, it might be considered wrong. However, if the author's reasoning was to encourage independence, but without considering the risks, that could be seen as a failure in support.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author might have misjudged the situation. While the intention wasn't to harm, the refusal to offer shelter under such circumstances could be seen as neglecting the friend's needs and the potential risks involved.\n"
