He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author (the person who posted the question) is in the wrong for not letting their best friend, Jake, crash at their house after his wife died. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: Jake is really struggling with grief, has been drinking and sleeping a lot, and the author's wife was upset with the author for turning Jake away. The author's reasoning was that Jake needed to eventually get over his grief and not avoid his house. But Jake ended up sleeping on the streets, which the author didn't intend.\n\nHmm. The author's intention was good, right? They wanted to help Jake move past his grief by not letting him stay. But does that justify not allowing him to stay, even if he's in a vulnerable state? On the other hand, the author did let the daughter stay, which is a responsible move to protect the child. But Jake was left alone, and he went to the streets. Is the author responsible for that outcome?\n\nI think this is a tough one. Grief can be overwhelming, and people in such states might need different forms of support. The author might have thought that staying overnight would prevent Jake from facing his home, which could be part of the healing process. However, turning someone away when they're a mess, even if they're a friend, could be seen as not offering enough support during a crisis. Jake's actions led to him being on the streets, which is dangerous, but the author's intention wasn't to cause that. \n\nBut maybe the author should have considered that Jake might not have other options. Friends often support each other in times of need, and the author's refusal might have made Jake feel abandoned. The line between helping someone heal and not enabling them is thin. The author did allow the daughter, so they did help in that aspect. However, the way it was handled might have been harsh, even if well-intentioned. \n\nAnother angle: Is it the author's responsibility to provide shelter? If Jake wasn't neglecting his daughter, maybe the author's action was to protect the child's well-being. But Jake's health is his own, unless he was in immediate danger. The author tried to be firm to encourage Jake to face his grief, but maybe that was too abrupt. \n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because their intention was to help Jake by not letting him escape. But the outcome was negative, which complicates things. However, the author didn't know it would lead to Jake sleeping on the streets. They might have thought he'd stay at his house or find another place. The key is whether the author's action was reasonable. Maybe not letting a grown man stay, knowing he's struggling, isn't the same as not letting a child. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
