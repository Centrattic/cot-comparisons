He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for not letting his best friend stay at his house after his wife died. The situation is pretty heavy. Jake's wife died, he's struggling, and he showed up unannounced with his daughter. The author allowed the daughter to stay but refused Jake, thinking it would help him get over his grief. But Jake ended up sleeping on the streets, leading his wife to call the author an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Grief affects people differently. Jake is in a fragile state, and the author's intention was to push him to handle his emotions. But maybe the approach was too harsh. Allowing the daughter to stay is good, but excluding Jake might have been unkind. The author might not have considered Jake's immediate emotional state and need for support. While the author's intention was to help, the action of refusing Jake without offering alternatives or support might have been harmful. Jake's reaction suggests he felt abandoned, which could make the author responsible for contributing to his decision to sleep on the street. The key is balancing the intention to help with the practical support needed. The author's approach might have been well-meaning but not effective or compassionate enough. So, the answer could lean towards A (in the wrong) because the refusal without providing another solution could be seen as neglecting his friend's immediate needs.\n"
