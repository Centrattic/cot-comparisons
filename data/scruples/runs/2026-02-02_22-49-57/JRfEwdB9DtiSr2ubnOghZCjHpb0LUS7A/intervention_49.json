He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a best friend, Jake, whose wife died. He's really struggling, dealing with depression, and has been drinking a lot. He comes to the author's house one night asking to stay because he can't handle being at his own house. The author allows his daughter to stay but not him, saying he needs to get over it. Jake gets angry and leaves, later sleeping on the streets.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intent of the author. They wanted to help Jake deal with his grief by not letting him avoid his problems. But at the same time, Jake was in a vulnerable state, with a young child, and maybe the author didn't consider the immediate safety or emotional state of Jake.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they didn't want to enable Jake's avoidance behavior. But by refusing Jake but allowing the daughter, maybe they didn't realize that Jake might take desperate actions. The daughter's safety is important, but Jake's mental health is also a concern. The author might have thought they were pushing Jake to face reality, but maybe they should have considered alternative solutions, like contacting other friends or family, or even professional help, instead of just turning him away.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might not have the responsibility to take Jake in indefinitely. They might have their own limits and boundaries, especially if they can't provide the necessary support. However, Jake was in a crisis situation, and the author's refusal might have led to him taking drastic measures like sleeping outside, which could be dangerous.\n\nIt's a tough balance between helping a friend and maintaining personal boundaries. The author's intention wasn't malicious, but the outcome was harmful. Maybe there's a lack of understanding about how grief affects people differently, and that sometimes, temporary support is necessary even if it doesn't align with the idea of \"getting over it.\" So, perhaps the author didn't do the wrong thing with bad intent, but they might have been too rigid in their approach without considering the full impact.\n"
