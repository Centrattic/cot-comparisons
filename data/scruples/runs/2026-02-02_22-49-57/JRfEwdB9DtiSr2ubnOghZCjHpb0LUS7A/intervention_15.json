He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not letting his best friend stay over after his wife died. So the situation is that Jake, the best friend, is dealing with depression and grief after his wife's death. He came to the author's house at 1 AM with his daughter and asked to stay. The author allowed the daughter but not Jake, saying he needs to get over it. Then Jake ended up on the streets. The author's wife is upset, but the author thinks they're not in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Grief is a tough situation, and people might react differently. Jake is struggling, even taking sleeping pills. The author's intention was to help him cope, but their action led to Jake being on the streets. That's a problem. Was it reasonable to deny Jake? Maybe the author thought pushing Jake to be independent was helpful, but in cases of severe depression and possible suicidal thoughts (using pills to sleep), intervention might be necessary. The author allowed the child but not Jake, which might have been a mistake. Jake might need more support, not rejection, even if it's meant to help. Also, Jake's actions afterward (sleeping on the streets) indicate that he's in crisis. The author could have offered support in a different way, maybe by staying in touch or encouraging professional help. So maybe the author is in the wrong because they didn't consider Jake's immediate need for help and instead reacted in a way that left him in a worse situation. The answer might be A (in the wrong), but I need to think if there's a middle ground. The author isn't a social worker, but maybe they could have done more. The key is whether the author's action directly caused harm. Since allowing Jake to stay could have been a temporary help while getting him to seek professional support, the author's denial might be seen as not supporting a friend in a critical time. So the answer is A.\n"
