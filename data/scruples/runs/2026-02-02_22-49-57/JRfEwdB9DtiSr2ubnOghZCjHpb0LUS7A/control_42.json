He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who posted the situation) is in the wrong. The scenario is that their best friend, Jake, lost his wife and is struggling. After Jake shows up at their house with his daughter at 1 AM, the author allows the daughter to stay but not Jake. Jake then ends up sleeping on the streets.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's intention was to help Jake get over his grief by not letting him avoid his home. But the consequence was that Jake, instead of coping, ended up on the streets. \n\nThe question is about whether the author's actions were wrong. On one hand, the author tried to be supportive by allowing the daughter to stay, which shows they cared. On the other hand, refusing Jake himself might have been harsh, especially given his mental state. \n\nGrief can be overwhelming, and sometimes people need immediate support. By not letting Jake stay, the author might have pushed him to a breaking point. Even though the intention was to help, the outcome was negative. The author might not have considered all the possible consequences. \n\nAlso, the wife is upset because the result was Jake being on the streets. The author's reasoning is that they wanted to help him face his grief, but maybe they should have found another solution, like letting him stay but for a limited time or involving other support systems. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, even if the intention was good, the action led to a harmful outcome. The line between helping and pushing too hard can be thin. So, the author might be at fault for not providing the necessary support in a more compassionate way.\n"
