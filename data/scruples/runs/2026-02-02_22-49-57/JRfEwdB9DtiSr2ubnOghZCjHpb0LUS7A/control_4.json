He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong (AITA). The scenario is about a best friend, Jake, whose wife died. He's struggling, and the author refused to let Jake stay at their house but allowed his daughter. Jake then went to sleep on the streets, and the author's wife is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's reasoning was that Jake needed to \"get over it eventually,\" so they allowed the daughter but not Jake. The user is asking if that was the right call.\n\nOn one hand, the author might be trying to be supportive by encouraging Jake to face his grief. But refusing housing could lead to harmful consequences, especially since Jake was already suicidal. The author allowed the daughter to stay, which shows they care, but excluding Jake might have been neglecting his immediate emotional and physical needs. \n\nThe author's intention was to help him move past the grief, but the outcome was Jake sleeping on the street, which is dangerous. Even if the intention was good, the action might have been too harsh without considering the immediate risks. The author could have offered a safer alternative, like staying in a different room or connecting him with crisis resources. \n\nAlso, the fact that Jake was taking sleeping pills and was a mess suggests he's in a vulnerable state. The author's approach might not be the most compassionate way to handle a friend in such a critical situation. So, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because they didn't provide adequate support, even if their intention was to help in the long run.\n"
