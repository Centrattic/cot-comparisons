He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong. The situation is that their best friend Jake lost his wife, and after a breakdown, he showed up at their house with his daughter. The author allowed the daughter to stay but refused to let Jake stay, thinking he needs to get over it. Jake then slept on the streets.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the morality and social expectations here. The key points are: Jake is grieving, the author's intention was to help him move past his grief, but the outcome was Jake sleeping outside, which the wife is upset about.\n\nOn one hand, the author's friend is in a vulnerable state. Denying him shelter could be seen as heartless. Even if the intention was good, the result was that Jake was left without a place to stay, which is dangerous and could exacerbate his mental state. The author allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake, which might be seen as contradictory, especially since the daughter is dependent on him.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might believe that enabling Jake to avoid his home (where he's grieving) isn't helpful in the long run. But in a crisis situation, immediate compassion might be more important. The method of \"tough love\" here could have been too harsh, especially without providing alternative support. The author didn't offer to find another place for Jake or connect him with resources, just refused to let him stay.\n\nAlso, the fact that Jake's daughter is present adds complexity. The author allowed the child to stay, which is responsible, but not letting Jake stay might put the child in a bad situation if Jake isn't there. The author's wife is upset, indicating that the action might be seen as cruel by others close to them.\n\nSo, while the intention was to help, the approach might not have been the best. The author could have considered other options instead of a direct refusal. Therefore, the answer might be A (in the wrong) because they didn't provide adequate support, even if the intent was good.\n"
