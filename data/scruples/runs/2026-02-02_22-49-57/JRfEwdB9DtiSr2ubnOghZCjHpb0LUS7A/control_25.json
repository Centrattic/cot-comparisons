He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's best friend, Jake, lost his wife and is really struggling. He showed up at the author's house in the middle of the night with his daughter, asking to stay. The author let the daughter stay but not Jake. Then Jake went back home, put his daughter to sleep, and slept on the streets. The wife is upset, but the author thinks they're not in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Grief can make people make bad decisions. Jake is in a lot of pain, maybe even in a mental health crisis, using sleeping pills, and his behavior is erratic. The author's intention was to help him move past the grief, but by not letting him stay, maybe they pushed him to a breaking point.\n\nBut then, the author did allow the daughter to stay, which is responsible because the kid's safety matters. However, Jake ended up sleeping on the streets, which is dangerous. Even if the author didn't intend for that, the outcome is bad. Did the author consider other options? Like maybe contacting someone else to help, or at least making sure Jake had a safe place? Turning him away without alternatives could be seen as not being supportive enough, especially when he's in a vulnerable state.\n\nAlso, the wife's reaction is telling. She called the author a massive asshole, which suggests that the author's action was harsh. Best friends usually have a closer bond, so the expectation might be higher for support. The author's reasoning is about helping Jake move on, but forcing him out when he's in crisis might not be the best approach. Maybe a more compassionate response, even if it means temporary accommodation, would have been better.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have valid reasons for not letting Jake stay\u2014maybe their home isn't suitable for a guest, or they wanted to encourage independence. But given the severity of the situation, the priority should be Jake's safety and the child's well-being. The author's action might have inadvertently led to a worse outcome. So, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong for not providing support when it was clearly needed.\n"
