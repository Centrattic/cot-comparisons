He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person in the AITA scenario) is in the wrong for not letting their best friend Jake stay the night after his wife died. The friend showed up with his 3-year-old daughter, and the author allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake. Jake then went to sleep on the streets, and the user's wife is upset, but the user thinks they're not in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Jake is grieving and struggling with depression, possibly substance abuse. The author's intention was to help Jake get over his grief by not enabling him. But the outcome was that Jake slept on the streets, which is dangerous and concerning. \n\nThe author's action was based on the belief that Jake needs to toughen up. However, in grief, people can be in a fragile state. Even though the author allowed the daughter to stay, Jake left, leading to a risky situation. The author might not have considered the immediate emotional needs of Jake and the potential consequences. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might think they're helping by not letting Jake stay, encouraging him to face his environment. But is that compassionate? Grief counseling often emphasizes support, not pushing someone to 'get over it' quickly. The author might have been too rigid in their approach without understanding Jake's specific needs.\n\nAlso, the friend's daughter is present. The author allowed the child to stay, which is responsible, but Jake's mental state is a different concern. There's a possibility the author's refusal caused Jake to act out in desperation. \n\nSo, the key points are: intention vs. outcome, the nature of grief support, and the potential harm caused by the refusal. While the author had good intentions, the result was harmful. In such situations, empathy and flexibility are important. Maybe the author could have found a middle ground, like allowing Jake to stay but setting some boundaries, or encouraging him to seek professional help immediately. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author's approach was appropriate. Since Jake was in a vulnerable state and the refusal led to him sleeping outside, it's possible the author didn't fully support their friend's needs during a critical time. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong. But the question is whether the action itself was right or wrong, not just the outcome. \n\nHmm. The user's wife thinks they're an asshole, but the user believes they're helping. However, in AITA scenarios, the community often looks at both intent and impact. If the author's action caused harm, even if unintended, they might be seen as in the wrong. So, the answer might lean towards A (yes, in the wrong). But I need to be careful. The author tried to be supportive by letting the child stay, but refused Jake. If the author thought Jake could handle it, maybe they're not wrong. But Jake's behavior suggests he's not in a state to be left alone. \n\nI think the answer is A. The author's approach was too harsh without considering the immediate risk to Jake's well-being. Support during grief is crucial, and refusing help when someone is in crisis can be seen as inconsiderate, even if the intention was to help them in the long run.\n"
