He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not letting their best friend crash at their house after his wife died. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the situation: Jake's wife died in a car crash. He's really struggling, dealing with depression, drinking, and using sleeping pills. He shows up at the author's house with his daughter at 1 AM, asking to stay. The author lets the daughter stay but not Jake. Jake then goes to sleep on the streets. The author's reasoning is that they wanted to help Jake get over his grief, while the wife is upset with the decision.\n\nSo, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't, but I need to evaluate. Let's consider the factors.\n\nJake is in a vulnerable state. He's dealing with the loss of his spouse and the responsibilities of raising a 3-year-old. His mental health is deteriorating. The author's action was to not let Jake stay, which led to him sleeping on the streets. While the author's intention was to help Jake move past his grief, the consequence was potentially dangerous\u2014sleeping outside could be risky for a man in his emotional state.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might have thought that allowing Jake to stay would hinder his recovery. By setting boundaries, they wanted to push him to cope independently. But is it right to make someone sleep outside when they're struggling so much? The author allowed the daughter to stay, which is a good move, but not letting Jake in could be seen as cold, even if the intention was good.\n\nAnother angle: the author's responsibility. They have an obligation to their own family and safety. However, the question is about whether they're in the wrong towards their friend. If Jake was in immediate danger or the situation was a crisis, the author might have a duty to help more.\n\nAlso, the author's wife is upset, which adds to the conflict. The author might not have fully considered the emotional impact or the practical risks Jake faced. Maybe there was a better solution, like contacting other resources or mental health services instead of just turning him away.\n\nBut the author's intention is a key point. They didn't want to enable Jake's avoidance of his grief. However, the method of enforcing that by sending him to the streets, rather than finding a safer alternative, might be the issue. The outcome (sleeping on the streets) is much worse than the intention.\n\nIn summary, while the author had good intentions, the action of not letting Jake stay led to a harmful outcome. They might not be in the wrong for setting a boundary, but the consequence could be seen as inconsiderate. It's a tough call between empathy and boundary-setting.\n"
