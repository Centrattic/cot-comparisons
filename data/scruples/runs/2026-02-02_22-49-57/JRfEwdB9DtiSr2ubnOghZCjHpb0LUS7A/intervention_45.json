He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if they're in the wrong for not letting their best friend, Jake, stay the night at their house after his wife died. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, Jake's wife passed away in a car crash a month ago. He's been really struggling, either drinking or sleeping a lot. He has a 3-year-old daughter, and while he's not neglecting her, he's clearly in a bad state. The user had a chance when Jake showed up at their door at 1 AM with his daughter. They allowed the daughter to stay but told Jake he couldn't because he needs to get over it. Then Jake left angry and later slept on the streets, putting his daughter to sleep first. The user's wife is upset with them, but the user thinks they're not in the wrong.\n\nHmm. The user's intention was to help Jake get over his grief, but allowing the daughter to stay while excluding Jake might have unintended consequences. Jake was in a fragile state, and the user's refusal could have made him feel abandoned or unsupported, especially when he was trying to take his daughter to a safe place. The user's approach was to push Jake to cope, but maybe they didn't consider the immediate emotional impact. Also, Jake's actions of sleeping on the streets after putting his daughter to sleep might be a red flag. The user could have offered a different solution, like setting boundaries but still providing a temporary safe space for both. \n\nOn the other hand, the user might have been concerned about enabling Jake's avoidance behavior. However, in a crisis, the immediate need is often more critical. The user's wife is a child, so the user might have been trying to protect their own household from potential issues. But Jake's daughter is a minor, and if the user allowed the kid to stay but not the father, that could be problematic, especially if the father isn't capable of taking care of her. But Jake did put his daughter to sleep before going out, so maybe he's still responsible. \n\nThe key points here are the intention versus the outcome. The user's intention was to help, but the outcome was Jake feeling rejected and sleeping on the streets. The user might not be in the wrong if their reasoning was based on helping Jake face his grief. However, there's a question of whether they handled it compassionately. Maybe they should have considered alternative ways to encourage Jake without leaving him in a vulnerable situation. \n\nAlso, the user's wife is upset, which adds another layer. The user might not have discussed this beforehand, so their wife's reaction is a result of the situation. But that's more about the user's communication with their spouse than with Jake.\n\nIn conclusion, the user's action was intended to help, but the method might have been harsh. The answer might be B, not in the wrong, but there's a lot of nuance here. However, given that Jake was in a severe emotional state and the user's refusal led to him being on the streets, some might argue that the user should have found a way to support both Jake and his daughter. But since the user's intention was to encourage Jake to face his situation, it's a bit tricky. I think the correct answer is B, but I'm a bit conflicted because sometimes in grief, people need more support regardless of the approach.\n"
