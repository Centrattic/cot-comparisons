He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that Jake's wife died recently, and he's really struggling. He's been drinking a lot and is emotionally broken. He goes to the author's house at 1 AM with his 3-year-old daughter, asking to stay because his house reminds him too much of his wife. The author lets the daughter stay but refuses Jake. Then Jake ends up sleeping on the streets, and the author's wife is upset with him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Grief is a heavy thing. Jake is in a lot of pain, and the author might be trying to help him move past his grief by not giving him a place to hide. But on the other hand, Jake had his daughter with him, and the author didn't let the dad stay. That could be risky for the child's well-being if the dad isn't capable of taking care of her alone. Also, the author's wife is upset, which suggests she thinks the author was too harsh.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that Jake needs to get over it, but is that the role of a friend? Friends are supposed to support each other through tough times. Even if the author thinks Jake needs to face his emotions, not providing a safe place might have led to a worse outcome, like sleeping on the streets. The author might have thought they were helping, but maybe they should have considered Jake's immediate needs for shelter and safety, especially with the child present.\n\nAlso, the timing at 1 AM is important. Maybe the author felt it was too late and had rules about overnight guests, but Jake was in a crisis. The author could have set boundaries for themselves, allowing Jake to stay temporarily under certain conditions, rather than refusing entirely. The key here is balance between personal limits and the friend's needs during a crisis.\n\nI think the author might be in the wrong because even though they had good intentions, they didn't consider the immediate safety of Jake and his daughter. Friends in such situations need support, and the author's refusal could have contributed to Jake's decision to sleep on the streets. The author's wife's reaction also indicates that the decision wasn't well-received, especially regarding the child's welfare. So, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
