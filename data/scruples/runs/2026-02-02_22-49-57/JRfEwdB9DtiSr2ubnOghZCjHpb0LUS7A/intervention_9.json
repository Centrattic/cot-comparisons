He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about whether it's wrong to not let a best friend and his daughter stay over after his wife died.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend Jake's wife died recently. He's really struggling, using alcohol, becoming depressed. He tried to come to the author's house for the night but the author allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake. The author's reasoning was to help Jake get over the grief. But Jake then went to sleep on the streets, and the author's wife is upset.\n\nThe user's take is that the author isn't in the wrong. But the question is to decide between A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nSo, considering the options. The author's action was to deny Jake but allow his daughter. The reasoning given is that they want Jake to \"get over\" the grief. But is that a valid approach? \n\nFrom an empathy standpoint, when someone is in deep grief and is in crisis, cutting them off physically might not be the best support. Even if the intention is to help, actions speak louder. By sending the daughter to sleep over but not allowing Jake, the author might be seen as not supporting Jake emotionally. \n\nAlso, Jake's actions of going to the streets are concerning. The author's wife is upset because the outcome was negative. The author might have not considered the immediate safety and emotional stability of Jake. \n\nHowever, the author's intent was to help Jake move past his grief. But maybe the approach was too harsh. In grief, people need support and understanding, not being pushed to deal with it alone. \n\nIs the author wrong? It's a tough call. The author might have made a poor judgment call but isn't necessarily malicious. But in terms of supporting a grieving friend, not offering a safe place might be considered wrong, even if the intention was good. \n\nSo, considering the situation where someone is suicidal (he's taking sleeping pills to sleep) and in crisis, the author's decision to turn him away could be seen as AITA. The right action might have been to offer more support, even if it's challenging. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong).\n"
