He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a best friend, Jake, whose wife died. He's struggling, and the author of the question refused to let him stay overnight at their house. The key points are the author's reasoning and the consequences.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. Jake is in a lot of emotional pain, dealing with the loss of his wife. He's been drinking, sleeping a lot, and even mentioned taking sleeping pills. When he showed up at the author's door with his 3-year-old daughter, the author allowed the daughter to stay but refused Jake. The author's reasoning is that Jake needs to get over it eventually. However, Jake ended up sleeping on the streets after putting his daughter to sleep.\n\nNow, considering the author's actions. Allowing the daughter to stay is good, but refusing Jake completely might have led to a worse outcome. The author's intention was to help Jake cope, but by not allowing him in, they might have inadvertently caused him to end up on the streets, which is dangerous. The wife criticized the author, calling them an asshole, and the author is seeking validation.\n\nPossible angles: The author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider Jake's immediate emotional state and the risk of him harming himself. Even if the author wanted to push Jake to deal with his grief, refusing him shelter when he's in crisis could be seen as insensitive. On the other hand, the author might not be in the wrong because they were trying to encourage independence, but the method was harsh. However, the fact that Jake ended up on the streets suggests that the author's approach didn't account for the immediate danger.\n\nAnother angle: The author could have found a middle ground, like allowing Jake to stay for a while but setting boundaries. Refusing both might have been too abrupt. The key is whether the author's action was reasonable given the circumstances. The author's reasoning is flawed because they didn't consider the potential consequences of Jake being left without shelter, especially when he's in a vulnerable state. So, the answer leans towards A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
