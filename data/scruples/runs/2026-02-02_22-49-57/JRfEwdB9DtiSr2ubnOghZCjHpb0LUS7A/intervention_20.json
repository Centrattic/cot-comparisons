He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's best friend, Jake, who is dealing with the death of his wife. The author refused to let Jake stay at their house, leading to Jake sleeping on the streets.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. Jake is in a vulnerable state after his wife's death. His mental health is deteriorating; he's drinking, sleeping a lot, and even taking sleeping pills. He approaches the author for help, bringing his daughter. The author allows the daughter to stay but not Jake. The next day, Jake sleeps on the streets, and the wife is upset with the author.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they wanted to help Jake get over his grief. But the outcome was harmful. The question is whether the author's action was wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the author might have thought they were helping by not enabling Jake to avoid his problems. On the other hand, refusing shelter could be seen as abandoning someone in crisis, especially with a child involved. The author's wife is upset because Jake ended up on the streets. The key factors here are the intent versus the consequence. The author's intent was to push Jake to cope, but the result was potentially dangerous. Did the author have other options? Maybe they could have set boundaries while still providing temporary shelter. Alternatively, maybe they could have connected Jake with professional help or other resources instead of just saying no. \n\nThe author might have failed to consider that Jake was in a severe mental health crisis and that pushing him too hard without support could lead to harmful actions. Also, the fact that Jake took sleeping pills and was in a state where he could harm himself adds a layer of concern. The author's decision might have ignored the immediate risk to Jake and his daughter's safety. \n\nIn terms of social norms, helping a friend in need is usually expected, especially when they're in such a vulnerable state. The author might have overstepped by being rigid in their refusal, not considering the potential consequences. The fact that Jake's daughter was with him adds another layer of responsibility. The author allowed the daughter to stay but not the father, which could be seen as neglecting the father's need for support. \n\nHowever, there's also the argument that the author had their own limits and were trying to encourage independence. But in a situation like this, where someone is suicidal or self-harming, the standard response would typically be to encourage professional help and not to leave them alone. The author's approach might have been misguided because they didn't ensure Jake had other resources or support systems in place. \n\nIn summary, while the author's intent was to help Jake move past his grief, the method was flawed. The refusal to offer shelter without providing alternative support could be considered wrong because it left Jake in a dangerous situation. The author should have considered both Jake's mental health and the safety of his daughter, perhaps by setting conditions for staying or involving other support networks. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
