He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario (the author) is in the wrong for not letting their best friend stay at their house after his wife died. The situation involves Jake, the friend, who's clearly in a very vulnerable state. He's struggling with depression, using sleeping pills, and avoiding his home due to memories of his wife. \n\nThe author allows Jake's daughter to stay but refuses Jake himself, reasoning that he needs to eventually cope. But Jake then ends up on the streets. The wife is upset, calling the author an asshole, but the author thinks they're helping.\n\nFirst, consider the emotional state of Jake. Grief can cause people to act out or make poor decisions. The fact that Jake is using sleeping pills to sleep and can't be in his house suggests he's in a crisis. The author's action here is to not let Jake stay, which might push him further into a downward spiral. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's intention was to help Jake by making him face his situation. But does that justify the method? Maybe the author should have set a boundary but provided alternative support. For example, allowing Jake to stay for a night or two with a plan to help him transition back. \n\nThe key points here are: the author's refusal leads Jake to sleep on the streets, which is dangerous. The author prioritized their own idea of what's good for Jake over his immediate safety. Even if they thought they were helping, causing someone to end up homeless when they're mentally unstable could be seen as neglecting their responsibility. \n\nAlso, the fact that Jake's daughter was allowed to stay shows the author had some compassion, but not enough to extend to Jake. Maybe the author should have considered that Jake's presence might be necessary to keep him safe. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, when someone is in a mental health crisis, the people around them have a duty to ensure their safety, even if it means making tough decisions. The author's action, while possibly well-intentioned, didn't take into account the immediate danger Jake might face if left alone. \n\nSo, the author's decision led to a harmful outcome. They might not have considered the consequences of sending Jake out alone. Therefore, they could be in the wrong for not providing the necessary support, even if their intention was to help him heal in the long run.\n"
