He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not allowing their best friend to stay after his wife's death. \n\nFirst, the situation: Jake's wife died recently, he's struggling with depression, and he's been drinking. He shows up at the author's house in the middle of the night with his 3-year-old daughter. The author allows the daughter to stay but not Jake. Then Jake goes to sleep on the streets.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they wanted to help Jake get over his grief. But the question is whether that reasoning justifies the action of not allowing him to stay. \n\nOn one hand, the author might be thinking that avoiding enabling Jake's avoidance behavior is important. If Jake keeps avoiding his house, he might not process his grief. But on the other hand, Jake is in a vulnerable state, and the author could be seen as not providing the necessary support. \n\nHowever, the author did allow the daughter to stay, which shows some level of support. The problem is Jake's behavior\u2014drinking and taking pills\u2014which could be risky, especially with a child. The author might not want to enable his self-destructive habits. \n\nBut letting him stay temporarily could have been a better approach, maybe with some boundaries. For example, allowing him to stay but setting rules about alcohol or getting help. The author's approach might have been too abrupt, leading Jake to take extreme actions like sleeping on the streets. \n\nThe wife's reaction is also a point to consider. She called the author an asshole, which suggests she felt they were uncompassionate. The author's intent was to help, but the method might have been flawed. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's tricky. The author's intention was good, but the execution might have been lacking. Not providing support during a crisis, even if it's about encouraging independence, could be seen as not being there when needed. So maybe the author is in the wrong because they didn't offer a middle ground. \n\nBut then again, if the author had allowed Jake to stay, maybe that would enable his avoidance. But given the situation, Jake was in a mental health crisis. The author's no might have pushed him into a worse situation. \n\nI think the answer hinges on balancing support and independence. Since Jake is in severe distress and the author's refusal led to him sleeping on the streets, which is harmful, the author might be in the wrong for not providing a safer alternative. So the answer is A.\n"
