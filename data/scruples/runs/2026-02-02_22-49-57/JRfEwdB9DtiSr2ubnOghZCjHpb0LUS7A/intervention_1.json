He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for not letting their best friend Jake stay at their house after his wife's death. The situation is pretty heavy. Jake's going through a really tough time, emotionally, and his behavior is concerning. He's depressed, taking sleeping pills, and ended up sleeping on the streets after being turned away.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they wanted Jake to get over his grief. But the outcome was Jake putting his daughter to sleep and then going to the streets, which is dangerous. The author's wife is upset, calling them an asshole, but the author feels justified because they thought their intention was to help.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author's intention was to encourage Jake to deal with his grief, maybe thinking he's avoiding the house where bad memories are. But on the other hand, Jake is in a vulnerable state, and refusing him shelter without a plan for support could be harmful. The author might have been trying to do the right thing, but the result is tragic. Did they have a responsibility to provide a safe environment, especially with a child involved? Also, is it reasonable to expect someone in deep grief to \"get over it\" by themselves without support?\n\nJake's actions\u2014taking sleeping pills, avoiding his home, ending up on the streets\u2014indicate a severe mental health crisis. The author's refusal might have pushed him into a worse situation. Even if the intention was good, the action might have been harmful. The presence of a 3-year-old daughter adds another layer of responsibility. The author allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake, which could leave the child in a dangerous situation if Jake isn't there to care for her. \n\nBut the author might have thought that allowing Jake to stay would enable avoidance behaviors, making it harder for him to cope. However, in a crisis, safety and immediate support are crucial. The author should have considered alternative solutions, like contacting other friends, family, or even emergency services if necessary. Turning someone away without a backup plan, especially when they're suicidal, could be seen as neglecting their well-being.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author's refusal led to Jake's daughter being left alone and Jake being on the streets. While the author might not be legally responsible, morally, they might share some responsibility for not ensuring Jake's safety. The key here is whether refusing help was the appropriate action given the circumstances. The author might be wrong because in times of crisis, support is essential, and cutting someone off without providing alternatives can have dire consequences.\n"
