He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is about a best friend, Jake, whose wife died. The author refused to let him stay at their house overnight, even though he showed up with his daughter. Instead, the author allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake. Now Jake slept on the streets, and the author's wife is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the details. The author's reasoning was to help Jake overcome his grief. But the consequence was that Jake ended up on the streets. The key here is whether the author's action was appropriate given the circumstances.\n\nJake is in a severe emotional crisis. He's a mess, using sleeping pills, and avoiding his house. When he showed up at the author's door, the author allowed the daughter but not him. That's a split decision. Maybe the author was trying to encourage independence but didn't consider the immediate risk to Jake's well-being.\n\nThe author's wife is upset because they think Jake shouldn't have been left alone. The author might have thought they were helping, but maybe they didn't account for Jake's mental state. If Jake was suicidal or in a state where he might harm himself, refusing to let him stay could be a problem. The author's action might have contributed to Jake's decision to sleep outside, which is dangerous, especially with a young child.\n\nThe author's intention was good, but actions can have unintended consequences. In a crisis, people might not act rationally. The author might have failed to provide the necessary support during a critical time. Even though they didn't want to enable dependency, pushing someone in such a fragile state to handle it alone might be seen as neglecting their responsibility as a friend.\n\nSo, even though the author's intention was to help, the outcome was harmful. They might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the immediate safety and emotional needs of their friend. The correct answer would be A (author is in the wrong) because they didn't provide necessary support during a crisis, leading to a potentially dangerous situation.\n"
