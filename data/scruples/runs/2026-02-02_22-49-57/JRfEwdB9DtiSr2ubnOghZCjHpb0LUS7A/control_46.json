He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that their best friend, Jake, lost his wife and is really struggling. He came to the author's house in the middle of the night with his daughter, asking to stay because he can't handle his house. The author let the daughter stay but not Jake. Then Jake went back, put the kid to sleep, and slept on the streets. The author's wife is upset, but the author thinks they're not wrong.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the emotional state of Jake. He's grieving, and he's in a bad place. He's using sleeping pills and seems to be in a state of depression. The author's reasoning is that they wanted to help him get over his grief by not giving him an easy escape. But is pushing someone who's in a mental health crisis to cope when they're not ready actually helping?\n\nThe author allowed the daughter to stay but not Jake. That seems a bit contradictory. Maybe they were trying to be responsible for the child's safety but not for Jake's immediate needs. But Jake putting his daughter to sleep and then leaving her to go to the streets is a red flag. The author might have thought that forcing Jake to stay in his house would help him confront his grief, but that could be harmful. People in crisis sometimes need support, not just being told to \"get over it.\"\n\nAlso, the author's decision not to let Jake stay might have contributed to him making a dangerous choice. Even if the intention was good, the outcome was Jake being homeless and possibly at risk. The daughter's safety is another aspect\u2014leaving a 3-year-old alone isn't okay, but the question is about the author's responsibility towards Jake.\n\nThe key points are: Is the author's refusal to help Jake in a time of crisis justified? Should a friend in such a state be left to fend for themselves, especially when they're making harmful decisions? The author might not have been wrong in the strictest sense, but their approach could be seen as lacking empathy and support. The answer might lean towards AITA (A for yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't provide the necessary support to a grieving friend, leading to a worse situation.\n"
