He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the user's best friend, Jake, is dealing with the death of his wife. He's really struggling, becoming depressed, and sometimes drinks or sleeps a lot. He told the user he couldn't take being in his house anymore and even takes sleeping pills. Then one night, Jake shows up at the user's door with his daughter, asking to stay. The user says the daughter can stay but Jake can't, thinking it's better for him to eventually handle his grief on his own. Jake leaves angry, and later the user finds out Jake went to sleep on the streets. The user's wife is upset, but the user thinks they were right.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the context. Jake is in a state of severe grief and might be in crisis. He's using sleeping pills, which is concerning. The user's intention was to help Jake move past his grief, but maybe they didn't fully consider the immediate danger. Allowing Jake to stay might have helped prevent him from making a harmful decision that night. However, the user did let the daughter stay, which is a good point\u2014they didn't turn her away. \n\nBut Jake is an adult, so the user isn't obligated to let him stay. That's true, but when someone is in emotional distress and suicidal thoughts, friends might have a responsibility to intervene. The user might have thought they were helping by pushing Jake to deal, but in reality, Jake needed immediate support, not a lesson. \n\nAlso, the user's wife is upset, which suggests maybe the user didn't consider the emotional impact on Jake. The user's decision might come off as callous, even if the intention was good. Jake later sleeping on the streets shows that he didn't have another place to go, which could have been dangerous. \n\nSo, the user's action might have been well-meaning but insufficient. They might have needed to find another solution instead of just saying no. Maybe they could have offered Jake a place to stay on different terms or connected him with professional help. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, even if the user isn't legally at fault, emotionally they might have failed a friend in need. So, maybe the answer is A (the user is in the wrong) because they didn't provide enough support during a critical time, even if their intention was to help Jake in the long run.\n"
