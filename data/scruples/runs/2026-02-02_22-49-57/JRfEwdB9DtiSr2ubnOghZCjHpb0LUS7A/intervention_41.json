He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not allowing their best friend to stay after his wife died. The situation is pretty intense. Jake's a mess, he's using sleeping pills, and he showed up unannounced at the author's house. The author let Jake's daughter stay but refused Jake, thinking he needed to get over his grief. But then Jake ended up on the streets, which the author didn't intend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intent versus the outcome. The author's intention was to help by pushing Jake to cope, but the result was Jake being homeless. That's a big consequence. Even if the intention was good, the outcome is severe. But is the author responsible for that outcome?\n\nJake's mental state is a key factor here. He's grieving, depressed, and possibly in a crisis. As a best friend, the author might have a responsibility to support him, especially when he's in such a vulnerable state. By not allowing Jake to stay, the author might have denied him access to help that he desperately needed. The author did allow the daughter, which is good, but Jake's well-being is also a concern.\n\nThe author might argue that they were trying to help by encouraging independence. But when someone is in a mental health crisis, sometimes the immediate need is for support and safety, not pushing them to get over it. The author could have offered to let Jake stay temporarily while also encouraging him to seek professional help or other support systems.\n\nAnother angle: the author's wife is upset, which suggests that the author's decision had emotional repercussions. The author might not have considered all the possible consequences of their refusal, such as Jake's desperation leading him to sleep on the streets. The author's approach might be seen as too harsh, given the circumstances.\n\nHowever, the author also has boundaries and their own household to consider. Maybe they felt they couldn't have Jake staying because of their own family dynamics or the situation. But in times of crisis, friends often need to step in more, even if it's inconvenient.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author's intention was to help, but the method might have been flawed. There's a balance between encouraging someone to cope and providing necessary support. Since Jake ended up in a worse situation, the author might share some responsibility for not considering alternative solutions or not offering support in a different way.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's tough. They might not have intended harm, but the outcome was harmful. In such situations, even with good intentions, the way it's handled can be seen as wrong if it leads to negative consequences. The author could have offered a different form of support or connected Jake with other resources instead of just turning him away. Therefore, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong.\n"
