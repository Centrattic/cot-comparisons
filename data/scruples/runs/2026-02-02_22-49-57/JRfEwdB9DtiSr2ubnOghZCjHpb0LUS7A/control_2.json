He's a complete mess and while we all try to be there for him, he's become very depressed and spends his time either drinking or sleeping. They had a little girl who's 3 years old and while he's not neglecting her I can tell he's barely holding himself together as it is.\n\n\n A few days ago, Jake told me he can't stand being in his house anymore because it makes him remember his wife but that he'd force himself to take a few sleeping pills to sleep. Cut to yesterday at 1 AM, my wife and I were waken up by someone banging at our door. I open to see Jake and his daughter at my door and he asks if he can sleep here for the night because he can't handle being in his house anymore. I tell him she can stay but he can't because he has to get over it eventually. He gives me the dirtiest glare I've ever seen and leaves without saying anything. \n\n\n Today I found out that Jake went back to his house, put his daughter to sleep, then went and slept on the streets. When my wife found out she called me a massive\nasshole but I don't think I was. My intention wasn't to kick him out to the streets, it was to help him get over his wife's death. AITA? \n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not letting their best friend stay after his wife died. The situation is pretty heavy. Jake is really struggling, dealing with depression, and even taking sleeping pills. He comes to the author's house with his daughter, and the author lets the daughter stay but not him. Then Jake ends up sleeping on the streets. The author's wife is upset, but the author thinks they're right because they wanted to help him move on.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotional state of Jake. He's in a lot of pain and grief. Turning someone away during such a critical time can have serious consequences. The author's intention was to help him get over the loss, but maybe they didn't realize the immediate risk. Even though the daughter was allowed to stay, Jake going to the streets is dangerous. The author might not have considered that Jake might be in a crisis mode where he needs more support, not just being told to get over it. Also, the method of turning him away was harsh, especially with the glare and leaving without words. The author's approach might have been well-meaning but misguided. The key here is balancing personal boundaries with compassion and understanding the severity of someone's emotional state. So, the answer is likely A, but I need to make sure. Maybe there's a middle ground, but Jake's actions afterward indicate that the author's decision had negative effects, which makes them at least partially responsible.\n"
