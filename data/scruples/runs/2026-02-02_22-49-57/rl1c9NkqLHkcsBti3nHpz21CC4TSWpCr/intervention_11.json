My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe person is 23, their friend is 20, and the friend's mom is 41. The mom and the author are in a casual sexual relationship after she started flirting with him. The author asked her out, and they've been seeing each other for a month and a half. The friend is upset and is trying to get others to hate the author. The author is upfront with the friend, and the mom insisted on being open about it. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, let's consider the ages. The author is 23, the friend is 20, and the mom is 41. All are adults. Legally, they're all of age, so that's not an issue. The problem here is more about social and emotional boundaries.\n\nThe mom initiated the flirtation, and the author reciprocated. The friend is clearly hurt, which makes sense because his mom is involved. Even though the author was upfront, the friend is now actively trying to turn others against the author. The author feels they're not in the wrong because everyone is an adult and can make their own choices.\n\nBut there's a dynamic here where the friend is part of the social circle, and the relationship is causing a rift. The author mentions that the mom insisted on being open with the friend, so maybe the author tried to handle it honestly. However, even with honesty, the friend's reaction is strong. \n\nNow, the ethical angle: is it wrong to be in a relationship with someone's parent? It's a gray area. Some might argue that it's a personal choice if everyone is consenting, but it can lead to social consequences, especially if the other person (the friend) is hurt. The author might not be at fault for the relationship itself, but the situation's impact on the friend and their social circle is significant. \n\nAlso, the fact that the mom is the ex-wife of the friend's father and is living with the friend complicates things. The friend is still in the house, so the relationship could be seen as taking advantage of the living situation, even if the mom is initiating. \n\nThe author claims to have made the friend aware and that the mom wanted it to be open. But even with that, the friend might feel betrayed regardless of communication. The author's decision to continue the relationship despite the friend's request to stop could be seen as disregarding the friend's feelings, even if legally and technically it's allowed.\n\nSo, while the author might not have broken any laws or explicit rules, the social and emotional implications are problematic. The answer might hinge on whether the author's actions are considered respectful in the context of their relationship with the friend and the friend's family dynamics.\n"
