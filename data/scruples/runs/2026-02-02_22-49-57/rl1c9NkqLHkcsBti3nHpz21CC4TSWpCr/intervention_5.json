My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The scenario involves a 23-year-old having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's 41-year-old mother. The friend found out and is upset, even going as far as trying to get their friends to turn against the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most places, the age of consent is 16 or 18, so 23 and 41 are both adults. Legally, they're allowed to be in a relationship. But the key issue here is the social and emotional dynamics. The friend is 20, and the author is in a relationship with his mother. Even though they're adults and can make their own choices, there's a social taboo around relationships between adults and the parents of their friends. This is often considered a betrayal of trust, especially since the friend is still part of the family and might see the author as crossing a boundary.\n\nThe author claims they were upfront with the friend. However, even if they were honest, the friend might still feel violated. The fact that the mother initiated the flirting complicates things, but the author chose to pursue it despite knowing the potential fallout. The friend's reaction is understandable because it's a complex situation where the author's actions could be seen as taking advantage of a position of closeness with the family.\n\nAdditionally, the author mentions that the relationship is causing social issues, but that's more about the consequences rather than whether it's right or wrong. The core question is about rightness. Even if both parties are consenting adults, the power dynamics and the social implications might mean the author is in the wrong because they disregarded their friend's feelings and the trust inherent in the friendship.\n\nSo, considering all factors, even though there's no legal wrong, the social and emotional impact on the friend and the family makes it likely the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
