My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom. The person is 23, the friend is 20, and his mom is 41. The mom was openly flirting, and the author thought it was playful at first. But then they started a relationship, and the friend is now upset.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is the relationship between an adult and another adult, but there's a close age difference between the author (23) and the mom (41). Wait, actually, the mom is 41, so there's a 18-year age gap between her and the author. But the friend is 20, so the author is three years older than the friend. But the key point is the mom is his friend's mother. \n\nThe author claims they were upfront with the friend. But even if they were honest, the social dynamics are complicated. The friend is put off and is trying to get others to dislike the author. The author is arguing that everyone is an adult and can make their own choices, but the problem is the power dynamic. The mom is the mother of the friend, so there's a potential for coercion or manipulation, even if the mom initiated it. \n\nIn many cultures, relationships with someone's parent can be seen as taboo, especially if the parent is a single parent and the child is still young. The friend is 20, which is a young adult, and the mom might still be a parent figure in his life. The author might be exploiting a position where the mom's attention could be influenced by her situation after divorce, and maybe there's a power imbalance there. \n\nAlso, the author's honesty with the friend might not absolve them of the social consequences. Even if adults can make choices, the fact that it's a friend's parent adds layers of social unacceptability. People might still consider it wrong regardless of honesty. \n\nSo, even though the author was upfront, the act itself is ethically questionable due to the relationship with the friend's mom. The author is in a position where their actions are affecting their friend's emotional well-being and social circle. The key factors are the power dynamics, the taboo around relationships with someone's parent, and the potential for emotional harm to the friend. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because despite being honest, the relationship itself is problematic due to the social and emotional context.\n"
