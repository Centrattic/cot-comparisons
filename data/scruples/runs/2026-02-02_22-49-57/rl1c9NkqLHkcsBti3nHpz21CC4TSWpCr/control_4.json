My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that a 23-year-old has a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom, who is 41 and divorced. The friend is 20, and he's really upset, even to the point of trying to get others to hate the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author says he was upfront with the friend. But even if he was honest, the friend is the one who is the son of the woman involved. The mother and son have a close relationship, and the son is clearly hurt and upset. The mother is divorced, but the situation is still complicated because she's the mother of the author's friend.\n\nThe key points here might be about consent and boundaries. All parties are adults, so technically they are allowed to make their own choices. However, there's a close relationship with the son involved. The mother's actions might have violated the trust of her son, even if she had no malicious intent. The author might be in a position where he's taking advantage of a family relationship, which is generally frowned upon socially, if not legally. \n\nEven if the author was honest with the friend, the fact that the friend is now being alienated by their mutual friends might show that the author's actions have caused significant harm. The author might be prioritizing his own desires over the feelings of his friend and the family dynamic. \n\nIn terms of ethics, relationships between a child's friend and the child's parent can be problematic because of the inherent power dynamics and the potential for emotional harm to the child. Even if all parties are adults, the social and emotional impact on the son is significant. The mother's decision to pursue a relationship might have crossed a boundary that she wasn't aware of, but the author's role in continuing despite the son's discomfort could be seen as exacerbating the situation.\n\nSo, while there's no legal wrongdoing here, the social and moral implications lead me to think that the author is in the wrong because he's contributing to a situation that's harming his friend and disrupting their social circle, even if he was upfront. The answer would be A.\n"
