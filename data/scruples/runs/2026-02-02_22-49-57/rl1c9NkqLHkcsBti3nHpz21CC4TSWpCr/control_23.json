My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a 23-year-old having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's 41-year-old mom. The friend is 20, and the mom is divorced. The user says they were upfront and honest with the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend is 20, so still young, and the mom is in a position of authority as a parent. The author initiated the relationship after the mom was flirting. The key points here are consent, honesty, and the impact on the friend and their social circle.\n\nEven though the author was honest, the situation is inherently fraught. Taking advantage of a friend's parent can strain relationships, especially when the friend is still part of the household. The mom might be in a better position to make choices, but the power dynamic between the author and the friend is important. The friend's feelings are valid, and the author is causing significant social issues by continuing the relationship despite the friend's objections.\n\nAlso, even though all parties are adults, the mother-son relationship is complex. The author's actions could be seen as exploiting a vulnerable position, especially since the friend is still living with his mother. The author's refusal to stop, leading to a smear campaign, shows a lack of consideration for the friend's feelings and social standing.\n\nSo, while the author was honest, the situation involves crossing boundaries that are socially and emotionally sensitive. The answer is likely that the author is in the wrong because they disrupted their friend's life and social connections, even if consensual. The impact on the friend's well-being and the social fallout suggest the author's actions are problematic.\n"
