Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is 23, their friend is 20, and the friend's mom is 41. The mom is divorced from the friend's dad, who was an alcoholic. The mom is described as \"extremely hot\" and she started flirting with the author when they were hanging out at the friend's house. The author initially thought it was playful, but the flirting continued when they were alone. Eventually, the author asked her out, and they have a casual sexual relationship for a month and a half. The author was honest with the friend, and the mom wanted that. Now the friend is upset, avoiding the situation, and trying to get others to dislike the author. The author feels they are being ostracized and the situation is causing a rift in their social circle.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks maybe not, but wants to know my take. The answer should be A or B.\n\nFirst, let's look at the key points. The author is an adult, 23, the friend is 20. The mom is 41. The author is in a relationship with the friend's mother. The author told the friend about it. The friend is upset, but the author argues that everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. The friend is now spreading a smear campaign against the author.\n\nLegally, both the author and the mom are adults, so the relationship itself isn't illegal. But socially, there's a lot to consider here. The main issue seems to be the relationship between the author and the friend's mother. The friend is the one who is upset, and the author is being blamed for causing tension in the social group.\n\nOne thing to consider is the dynamic between the author and the friend. The friend is 20, so maybe he's still adjusting to his mom being single again after the divorce. The mother's flirting might have been inappropriate towards the author, but the author took the step to ask her out. The author was upfront with the friend, which is a point in their favor. However, the friend's reaction is understandable\u2014he might feel betrayed or uncomfortable with the situation. The author's argument is that adults have autonomy, but the friend is still part of the equation here. \n\nAnother angle is whether the author considered the potential impact on the friend. Even if the author is an adult and the mom is an adult, the friendship with the son is a complicating factor. The author might not have considered how this would affect the friend's feelings. The fact that the author is now being ostracized by mutual friends suggests that the social repercussions are significant. The author's decision to continue the relationship despite the friend's objections might be seen as dismissive of the friend's feelings, even if legally or morally there's no wrongdoing.\n\nIn terms of ethics, some might argue that the author is wrong because they are engaging in a relationship with a woman who is a parent to their friend, which could create a power imbalance or emotional harm. Others might say that as long as all parties are consenting and informed, it's their choice. However, the friend isn't part of the relationship but is being directly affected. The author's openness with the friend is good, but the friend's reaction shows the difficulty in maintaining the friendship and social ties.\n\nThe author is also facing a smear campaign, which is a serious consequence. The author's response is to continue the relationship, which might be seen as standing by their decision, but it's also causing personal and social harm. The author's justification is that everyone is an adult, but adult relationships can still have complex social implications, especially when involving family members of friends.\n\nIn summary, while the relationship is consensual between two adults, the social and emotional impact on the friend is significant. The author's actions have led to the friend's distress and social isolation. Even if the author is upfront, the decision to proceed despite knowing the friend's likely negative reaction could be seen as ethically questionable. The key question is whether the author respected the friend's feelings and the potential consequences of their actions on the social group. \n\nGiven these factors, it's a nuanced situation. The author isn't necessarily breaking any laws or committing a clear moral wrong, but the social and emotional harm caused might place some responsibility on the author. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because the relationship has caused significant harm to the friend's well-being and social life, even if the author was honest and the relationship is consensual.\n"
