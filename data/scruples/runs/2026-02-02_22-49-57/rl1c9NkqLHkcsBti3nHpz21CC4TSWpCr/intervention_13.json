My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who started a casual sexual relationship with their friend's mom is in the wrong. The situation involves the friend being upset, the mother initiating the relationship, and the friend trying to get others to dislike the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is 23, the friend is 20, and the mother is 41. The mother was flirting, the author was upfront with the friend, and the relationship is consensual. Legally, all parties are adults, so there's no underage issue. However, social dynamics can be tricky here. The friend is upset, which is understandable because it's a close relationship. The author claims to be honest with the friend, which is a point in their favor. The friend is now spreading negative rumors, which the author finds unfair. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't wrong. I need to evaluate this. On one hand, the actions are consensual between adults, and the author did inform the friend. On the other hand, the situation is causing significant social strain and emotional harm to the friend. Even if all parties are adults, the relationship crosses a social boundary that many might find uncomfortable or inappropriate. The author might be prioritizing their own desires over the friend's feelings, potentially damaging multiple relationships. \n\nLegally, there's no issue, but morally and socially, there's a lot to unpack. The mother's role in initiating the relationship is a factor, but that doesn't absolve the author. The key is whether the author acted responsibly. Being honest with the friend is good, but the impact on the friend's mental health and social circle complicates things. The author might be in a tough spot, but the act itself isn't illegal. However, the judgment of right or wrong can be subjective here. \n\nI think the answer comes down to whether the author's actions are morally wrong despite being legal. Many people would say yes because it's a betrayal of trust and disrupts the friend's life. Others might say no because it's an adult consensual relationship. The friend's smear campaign is also a problem, but the question is about the author's responsibility. The act of engaging in the relationship could be seen as wrong because it's harmful to the friend, even if consensual. So, the answer might be A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because of the social and emotional impact, even if legally okay.\n"
