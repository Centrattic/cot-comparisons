My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who started a casual sexual relationship with their friend's mom is in the wrong. The key points here are the relationships involved and the consequences.\n\nFirst, the friend's mom is 41, the friend is 20, and the author is 23. The mom started flirting, and the author took the initiative to ask her out, even though they knew it would affect his friend. The author claims they were honest about the relationship with the friend. The friend is upset and is trying to get others to dislike the author, which is causing social issues.\n\nNow, I need to consider ethical perspectives. Legally, all parties are adults, so there's no legal issue. But socially and morally, there's a conflict. The friend might feel betrayed, even if the author was upfront. The mom's role as a parent figure complicates things. The author's actions have led to social consequences, but does that make them wrong?\n\nAlso, the author mentions the relationship is \"casual,\" but the mom's actions started with flirting. The author might feel justified in their actions because everyone is an adult. However, the dynamic with the friend is damaged, and the author's insistence on continuing the relationship despite the friend's wishes shows a lack of consideration for the friend's feelings and social standing.\n\nSo, while the author might not be breaking any laws, the moral responsibility here is questionable. The author's actions have caused significant harm to the friend's trust and the social circle. Even if they were honest, the act of engaging in a relationship with someone's parent can be seen as crossing a social boundary. The fact that the friend is trying to get the author ostracized is a result of this breach, but the author's decision to continue despite the consequences could be seen as the wrong choice. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
