My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) story is in the wrong. The situation involves a 23-year-old man in a casual sexual relationship with his friend's 41-year-old mother. The friend is upset and is trying to get others to dislike the author.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author was upfront with his friend, which is important. However, the dynamic here includes a close friendship where the friend lives with his mom. Even if all parties are adults, relationships with someone's parent, especially when the child is a close friend, can be ethically complex. The friend's emotional reaction is understandable, as it's a betrayal of trust. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong despite being honest. The answer usually hinges on consent and respect for boundaries. The mother is an adult and may have consented, but the friend's relationship with his mother is likely more intimate and trusting. The author's actions could be seen as violating that trust, even if he was upfront. \n\nAdditionally, the friend's age (20) and the fact that he's living with his mom might imply a closer than usual relationship. The author might argue that everyone is an adult, but the social implications and the potential for harm to the friend and their social circle are significant. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is often on how the actions affect those around you. Even if the relationship is consensual, the friend's distress and the resulting social fallout might tip the scale. The answer could be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the situation involves a close friend's parent, which is generally considered taboo and likely to cause significant emotional harm, despite the age of consent and honesty.\n"
