My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a 23-year-old having a casual sexual relationship with his 20-year-old friend's 41-year-old mom. The friend is upset, and the mom was initially flirtatious.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ages. The author is 23, the friend is 20, and the mom is 41. All are adults, so legally, there's no issue with the relationship. But the main point is the dynamic with the friend. The author says he told the friend, which he claims the mom insisted on. But even if he was honest, the friend still feels betrayed. \n\nNow, the key factors here are consent and transparency. The author claims he was upfront with the friend. However, in many cases, relationships with someone's parent, especially when the parent is a guardian or the child is still living with them, can be problematic regardless of consent. The fact that the friend is still living with his mom adds another layer. The mom and the author might be adults, but the friend's living situation could mean that the mom is still in a position of authority or influence over him. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that the friend is now trying to get friends to hate him, which is a social consequence but doesn't negate the moral or ethical considerations. The author might feel justified because everyone is an adult, but the act of having a relationship with someone's parent can be seen as crossing a social boundary, even if legally okay. \n\nAnother point is the initial dynamic. The mom was the one flirting, and the author escalated it. The author might not have intended harm but didn't consider the impact on the friend. The fact that the friend is 20 and the mom is his parent could mean there's an existing trust or bond that the author disrupted. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a gray area. Legally, not wrong. Ethically, it's more complicated. The author was honest, but the act itself is socially sensitive. The friend's reaction is understandable. So, while the author might not be legally at fault, ethically, he's in a tricky spot. The answer depends on whether the focus is on consent and adulthood versus the social and emotional impact on the friend.\n"
