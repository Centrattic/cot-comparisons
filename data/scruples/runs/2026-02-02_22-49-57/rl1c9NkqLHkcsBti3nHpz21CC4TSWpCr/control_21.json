My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having a casual relationship with his friend's mom. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author is 23, his friend is 20, and the mom is 41. The mom started flirting with the author when he was hanging out at their house. The author thought it was playful at first but she kept escalating. He asked her out, they had a casual relationship for a month and a half. He was upfront with his friend, but the friend is upset and trying to get others to hate the author. The author is now closer to the mom because of the situation.\n\nSo, the key points here are the ages and the relationships involved. The mom is the ex-wife of the friend's dad, so she's not his biological mom. But the author is essentially getting involved with someone who is a parent figure to his friend. Even though the mom is an adult, the dynamic here is a parent of a close friend. The author was honest with the friend, but the friend is still upset. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, relationships between two adults where there's a parental figure involved can be sensitive. Even if both the author and the mom are adults, the fact that the mom is the parent of the author's friend complicates things. The friend is 20, so he's still young, and the author is 23. The mom is 41, so she's significantly older. \n\nThere's also the aspect of consent and the initial dynamics. The mom was the one initiating the flirting, but the author took the initiative to ask her out. However, the main issue is the relationship with the friend's parent. Even if it's consensual and both parties are adults, the social consequences are significant. The friend is cutting off the author and trying to turn others against him. \n\nIn most cultures and social norms, relationships between someone and a parent of a close friend are considered taboo because it disrupts the social bonds between the friends. The author might not have done anything illegal, but socially, he's overstepping. The fact that he had to be upfront with the friend shows that he's aware of the potential issues. However, the friend's reaction is a direct consequence of this action.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is likely in the wrong not because of the legality but because of the social and emotional impact on the friend. Even if he was honest, the relationship itself is problematic due to the existing social ties.\n"
