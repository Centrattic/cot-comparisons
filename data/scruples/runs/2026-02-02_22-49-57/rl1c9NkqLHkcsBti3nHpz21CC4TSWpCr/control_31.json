My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a 23-year-old having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's 41-year-old mom. The friend is 20, and he's upset, even going so far as to try to get their friends to hate the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author claims he was upfront with his friend about the relationship. The mom initiated the flirting, and the author says everyone is an adult, so they can make their own choices. The friend is now trying to ostracize the author, but the author continues the relationship despite this.\n\nNow, from a moral standpoint, even if the author was honest, the situation involves a close friend's parent. There's a power dynamic here because the friend is still living with his mom, so the author might be in a position where the friend feels vulnerable. Even though the mom is an adult, the relationship could be seen as crossing a line in terms of social norms and respect for the friend's feelings.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that his friend is 20, which is a young age, and the friend's mom is divorced. Even if the mom is an adult, the relationship between the author and the mom could be perceived as taking advantage of a situation where the friend is still emotionally attached to his mom. The fact that the author continues the relationship despite the friend's anger and the resulting social fallout suggests that he's prioritizing his own desires over his friend's well-being and the group's dynamics.\n\nIn terms of ethics, while adults can make their own choices, relationships with close friends' parents are generally considered taboo because they can damage friendships and create uncomfortable dynamics. The author's decision to have a sexual relationship despite knowing it would hurt his friend shows a lack of consideration for the friend's feelings, which is a significant moral failing.\n\nSo even though the author was honest, the act itself is ethically questionable because it breaches social boundaries and harms a friendship. Therefore, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
