My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having a casual sexual relationship with their friend's mom. The situation involves a 23-year-old guy who started a relationship with the mom after she initiated flirting. The friend found out and is upset, trying to get others to dislike the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age aspect. The author is 23, the mom is 41, and the friend is 20. Legally, in most places, all parties are adults, so there's no legal issue. But socially, there's a taboo about relationships with someone's parent, even if they're divorced. The mom was divorced for two years, so maybe the friend doesn't have legal guardianship anymore. But the mom is still his mother, and the friend is still part of the family dynamic.\n\nThe author says he was upfront with the friend, but the friend is upset. Even if the mom initiated, the fact that it's the friend's mom adds complexity. The friend lives with his mom, so their relationship is close. The author might have crossed a social boundary here. Even if consensual, relationships with someone's parent can be seen as exploiting a familial connection or creating tension within the friend group.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the friend is now trying to get others to hate him. The author might be in the wrong not just for the relationship but for how it's affecting the friend and their group. Even if he was honest, the friend's emotional response is valid because it's his mom. The author's choice to pursue this despite the friend's feelings could be seen as selfish.\n\nAdditionally, the author says it's a casual relationship, but it's impacting the friend's life significantly. The mom's role as a parent adds another layer\u2014maybe she's not in a position to be in a relationship that could affect her child's well-being, even if they're divorced. The friend's mom might have a responsibility to consider her son's feelings, but the author might not have considered the consequences on the friend.\n\nIn social contexts, relationships with someone's parent are often frowned upon because they can disrupt family dynamics and friendships. Even if all parties are adults, the social stigma and the impact on others' lives can make it morally questionable. The author's decision to continue despite the friend's objections shows a lack of consideration for his friend's perspective, which could place the author in the wrong.\n"
