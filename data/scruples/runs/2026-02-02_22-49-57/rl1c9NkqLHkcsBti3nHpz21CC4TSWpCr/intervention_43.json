My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having a casual sexual relationship with their friend's mom. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the author is 23, their friend is 20, and the mom is 41. The mom is divorced and lives with her son. She started flirting with the author when they were hanging out at the house. The author thought it was playful at first but then escalated. They asked her out, had a casual relationship for a month and a half. The author was upfront with the friend, but the friend is upset and is trying to get others to hate the author. The author feels like they're not in the wrong because everyone is an adult.\n\nHmm. The key points here are consent, honesty, and the impact on the friend. The author was honest with the friend, which is important. Both the author and the mom are adults, so legally, there's no issue with the relationship. However, there's a social and emotional aspect to consider. The mom is the parent of the friend, so there's a power dynamic there. Even though the mom initiated the flirting, it could be seen as taking advantage of her position as a parent to someone the author is friends with. The friend is now upset and spreading the smear campaign, which complicates things.\n\nBut the author didn't force anything; they were upfront. The question is whether being in a relationship with a friend's parent is inherently wrong regardless of consent. Some might say it's a boundary issue because it affects the friend's life and relationships. Others might argue that if all parties are consenting adults, it's their choice. However, the fact that the author became closer to the mom as friends were lost shows the conflict. The friend's distress is significant, and even if the author is honest, the relationship still causes harm to the friend's social circle.\n\nSo, while there's no legal wrong, there's a moral consideration. The author might be in the wrong because they disregarded the friend's feelings and the potential emotional consequences, even if they were honest. The power dynamic and the impact on the friend's life are important factors. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (in the wrong) because of the harm caused to the friend and the potential for conflict of interest.\n"
