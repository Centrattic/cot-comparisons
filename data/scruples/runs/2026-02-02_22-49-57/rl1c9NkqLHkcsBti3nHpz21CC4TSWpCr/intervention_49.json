My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is 23, their friend is 20, and the friend's mom is 41. The mom is divorced and lives with her son. She started flirting with the author when he hung out at their house. Initially, the author thought it was playful, but as time went on, the flirting escalated. The author asked her out, they had a casual sexual relationship for a month and a half, and the author told the friend because the mom insisted on it. Now the friend is upset, trying to get their mutual friends to hate the author. The author is wondering if they're in the wrong despite being upfront about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the relationships involved. The author is friends with the son, and then gets involved with the mom. The son is 20, which is an adult, but maybe still in a position where the mom is a parent figure. The author is older than the friend but still in their 20s. The key points here are consent, age, and the impact on the friend and social circle.\n\nAge-wise, the author is 23, the mom is 41, both adults. So legally, there's no issue with age of consent. But socially, there's a dynamic where the mom is the parent of the author's friend. That could create a power imbalance or emotional conflict. The fact that the author told the friend might be important. If the author was honest, maybe that's a positive, but the friend is still hurt.\n\nThe friend is upset and is trying to smear the author's reputation. The author feels that even if they stopped seeing the mom, the friend wouldn't stop. The author is now closer to the mom because they're losing friends. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, as long as both the author and the mom are adults, there's no law being broken. But socially, it's a tricky situation. The friend may feel betrayed, especially since the mom is part of his family. The author might be seen as taking advantage of the situation, even if they were honest. \n\nAnother angle is whether the author considered the friend's feelings before getting involved. If the author knew the friend was close to his mom, maybe they should have thought about the consequences. But the author claims to have been upfront, so they might believe they're not at fault. \n\nThe fact that the author initiated this after the mom was flirting could matter. If the mom was the one who was pursuing the author, maybe the author is less in the wrong, but that's subjective. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the friend's reaction is extreme, but people have different boundaries. The author might not be in the wrong for making their own choices as an adult, even if it's a complicated situation. However, the impact on the friend's life is significant. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might depend on societal norms and personal ethics. Legally, the author is not in the wrong, but socially, some might judge them. Since the question is about being in the wrong in a general sense (like AITA), it's possible that the author is considered in the wrong because they're involved with their friend's parent, which can be seen as crossing a boundary, even if all parties are adults. The friend's anger is understandable, but the author's actions might be seen as causing unnecessary harm to their friendship and social circle.\n"
