My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a 23-year-old having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom, who is 41. The friend is 20 and really upset about it. The author says he was upfront with the friend, but now the friend is trying to get their mutual friends to hate him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The woman in question is the friend's mother, which automatically brings up issues of power and potential exploitation. Even though the author is 23 and the mom is 41, and they might both be consenting adults, the mother-son relationship complicates things. The friend is still living with his mom, which might mean she has a significant influence over him, maybe even a role as a parent figure in their household.\n\nThe author mentions that the mom was the one who started the flirting, but that might not absolve him. Even if someone is initiating, the person who is the child's friend might still be in a position where they can exploit that dynamic. Also, the fact that the author had to be upfront with the friend suggests that there's a breach of trust here. The friend is 20, so he's still pretty young, and his mother being the one who initiated this could create a conflict of interest in their relationship. \n\nAnother angle is the social consequences. The friend is now trying to ostracize the author, which is a serious fallout. Even if the author believes everyone is an adult and should make their own choices, the situation has caused a rift in their social circle. The author's argument that it's up to adults to make their own decisions might hold in a general sense, but in this specific case, the relationship is between two people where one is in a parental role relative to the author's friend. That could be seen as a conflict of interest or even a form of emotional manipulation, especially if the mom is using her position to get close to someone her son knows and trusts.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that this has driven him closer to the mom because he's losing friends. That could indicate that the social pressure is affecting his relationships, but it doesn't necessarily mean he's right. The key issue here is whether the author crossed a line by engaging in a relationship with someone who is in a parent figure role in relation to his friend. Even if consent is present, the power dynamics and the potential for emotional harm to the friend might make the author at fault.\n\nI should also think about societal norms and expectations. Relationships with someone who is a parent figure to a close friend are generally frowned upon because of the inherent complications and potential for hurt feelings. While it's true that all parties are adults, the specific context of the mother-son relationship creates a situation where the author's actions could be seen as taking advantage of the mother's position or the son's trust.\n\nIn conclusion, even though the author was honest with his friend, the nature of the relationship (with someone who is a parent figure) likely makes him at fault. The breach of trust, the potential power imbalance, and the resulting social fallout suggest that the author's actions were inappropriate despite being consensual.\n"
