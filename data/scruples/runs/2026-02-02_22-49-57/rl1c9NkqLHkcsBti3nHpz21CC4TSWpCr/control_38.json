My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is wrong for having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom. The scenario is that the friend is 20, the mom is 41, and the author is 23. The mom was flirting, they started dating after the friend's initial okay, but now the friend is upset and trying to turn their friends against the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider ethical and social norms here. The main issue is the relationship between the author and the friend's mother. Even if the friend allowed it, there's a power dynamic because the mom is the parent of the friend, which can complicate things. Also, the friend might feel violated, especially since he's young and the author is close to his age. \n\nThe author did inform the friend, which is a point in their favor, but the friend is still hurt. The moral question is whether it's right to pursue a relationship with someone who is the parent of a close friend. Even if all parties are adults, relationships can have emotional consequences beyond just legal consent. \n\nThere's also the aspect of how the friend is reacting. The friend is trying to get others to hate the author, which is not acceptable, but the author's actions could have caused this rift. The author might be in the wrong because the relationship could be seen as exploiting a situation where the friend's mom is in a vulnerable position post-divorce, or taking advantage of her attention. Additionally, maintaining a friendship while being involved with the friend's mother is inherently problematic, as it can lead to jealousy and betrayal, regardless of consent.\n\nOn the other hand, if everyone is of age and the friend initially approved, the author might argue it's their choice. But the friend's objection after the fact complicates things. The author's decision to continue the relationship despite the friend's distress might be seen as disregarding the friend's feelings, which is a social faux pas, even if not legally wrong.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author is likely in the wrong because the relationship is ethically problematic and has caused significant harm to the friendship. The answer would be A.\n"
