My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author, who's 23, has a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom, who's 41 and divorced. The friend is 20, so he's still pretty young. The author says he was upfront with the friend and the mom insisted on being open. Now the friend is upset and spreading negative things about the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ages involved. The author is 23, which is an adult age, and the mom is 41, also an adult. They're both capable of making their own decisions. But the friend is 20, which is just 18 in some places as the legal adult age, but in others, 21. Depending on the country, 20 might still be considered a minor. If the friend is under the age of majority, maybe there's a power dynamic here where the author is taking advantage of the mother's position as the parent of his friend. But if the friend is 20 and considered an adult, then maybe not.\n\nThen there's the aspect of the mother being in a position of authority over her son. Even though she's divorced, she's still his mother. There could be a conflict of interest or a potential for emotional manipulation because she's a parent figure. If the author started a relationship with her while living under the same roof as her son, that could be problematic. The son might feel betrayed or that the relationship is inappropriate because of the family connection.\n\nThe author says they were upfront with the friend, but the friend is still upset. The fact that the mom insisted on being open might not make it right if it's affecting the son negatively. Even if all parties are adults, the relationship is causing significant emotional distress to the son. The author is now facing social consequences because the friend is trying to turn others against him. The author also mentions that the relationship has driven him closer to the mom, which might indicate a deeper emotional attachment that complicates things further.\n\nAnother angle is the potential for emotional or psychological harm. The son is in a vulnerable position, and the author might be exploiting that by not considering the son's feelings enough. Even if the author isn't directly coercing the mom, the situation creates a power imbalance because the mom could potentially influence the son's living situation or emotional well-being. There's also the aspect of social norms; relationships with someone's parent can be seen as taboo or inappropriate, regardless of consent, because it disrupts family dynamics.\n\nOn the other hand, if both the author and the mom are acting consensually and the author was honest with the friend, some might argue that the author isn't at fault. But the key issue here is whether the relationship crosses a social or ethical boundary. Even if legally there's no wrongdoing, socially it's a mess. The author's actions are causing harm to the friend's social life and mental health, which could be considered ethically wrong.\n\nI think the answer depends on cultural context and personal ethics. However, given that the relationship is causing harm to the friend and potentially exploiting the mother's position as a parent, it's likely that the author is at least partially at fault. The fact that the author is still pursuing the relationship despite the friend's objections and the resulting fallout suggests a lack of consideration for the friend's feelings, which is a moral issue. So, even if legally there's no wrongdoing, ethically, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
