My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom. The author is 23, the friend is 20, and the mom is 41. The friend is upset, and the author is being ostracized by mutual friends.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author is an adult, as is the mom, so legally, there's no underage issue. But socially, it's a sensitive situation. The friend is 20, so under 18 in some places, but since the mom is divorced and the relationship is between two adults, the legal age of consent isn't an issue here. However, the social dynamics complicate things.\n\nThe author claims to be upfront with the friend. The mom insisted on honesty, so maybe they did tell the friend. But even if they did, the friend's reaction is understandable. The friend lives with the mom, so the relationship could create a very uncomfortable household environment. The friend might feel betrayed, especially if the mom was the one initiating the flirtation. The author might have crossed a line by pursuing a relationship with someone close to their friend, regardless of the mom's consent.\n\nAnother angle is the power dynamic. The mom is the parent figure of the friend, so even if both the author and the mom are adults, the relationship could be seen as exploiting a position where one person is in a parental role. The author might be seen as taking advantage of the situation, especially if the friend is still living with the mom.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the friend is actively trying to get others to hate him. That's a sign of social fallout, which is common in such situations. The author might be right in thinking everyone is an adult, but relationships can affect others in the circle, and the friend's feelings are valid. The author's decision to continue the relationship despite the friend's objections could be seen as not respecting the friend's boundaries and emotional well-being.\n\nIn terms of ethics, while there's no legal wrongdoing, there's a moral question about the impact on the friend. Even if the author was honest, the relationship disrupts the social group and harms the friend. The author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the consequences on their friend's life and emotional state. Relationships can be personal choices, but when they affect others negatively, especially those in close proximity like family, it's a grey area. So, while the author isn't breaking any laws, socially and ethically, they might be in the wrong for not considering the broader impact.\n"
