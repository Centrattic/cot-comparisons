My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a 23-year-old having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom, who is 41. The friend is 20, so that's a significant age difference between the author and the friend, but the author and the mom are in their respective adult years.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In most places, both the author (23) and the mom (41) are adults, so legally, the relationship isn't prohibited. However, there's a social and ethical component here. The friend is 20, so even though he's an adult, he's still young and might be more sensitive about this situation. The author claims they were upfront with the friend, which is important. But the friend is upset and spreading a smear campaign. \n\nEthically, the main issue is the dynamic of the relationship. The mom is the guardian of the friend, which introduces a power imbalance. Even if the author was honest, the fact that the mom is in a parental role over the friend adds complexity. The author might be in a position where they're taking advantage of a vulnerable situation, even unintentionally. The mom's role as a parent could influence her decisions, making the relationship ethically questionable despite both parties being adults. \n\nAnother angle is the social impact. The author's actions have caused a rift in their friend group, leading to isolation. While everyone is an adult, relationships involving family members can be particularly sensitive. The author's insistence on continuing the relationship despite the friend's objections might be seen as dismissive of the friend's feelings and the social consequences. \n\nAlso, the fact that the author and the mom started the relationship after the mother was openly flirtatious might be a point. The author could be seen as encouraging the relationship, but since they were honest with the friend, that could mitigate some blame. However, the ongoing conflict and the friend's smear campaign suggest that the author's actions have real-world negative effects on their social circle.\n\nIn conclusion, while there's no legal wrongdoing, the ethical aspects are murky. The power dynamic between the mother and her child's friend, the social fallout, and the potential for exploitation make this a situation where the author might be considered at fault, even if they were honest. So, the answer is likely A.\n"
