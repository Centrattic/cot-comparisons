My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is 23, and his friend is 20. The friend lives with his mom, who's 41 and divorced. The mom started flirting with the author, and eventually they had a casual sexual relationship. The friend found out and is upset, even trying to get their mutual friends to turn against the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The author says they were up front with the friend, but the friend is still upset. Even though the mom is an adult, there's a dynamic where the friend is the one living with her. The mom's actions might be seen as taking advantage of her son's friend, especially since the son is still in the house. There's also the aspect of the friend's feelings and the social circle being affected.\n\nThe author argues that everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. But the problem here is that the relationship is causing significant harm to the friend, who is now trying to ostracize the author. Even if the author was honest, the act of engaging with the friend's mother is a sensitive situation. It's possible that the mom's flirtation led to the author's decision, but the author still made a choice to pursue the relationship despite knowing the potential fallout.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the author's actions have caused distress to their friend and disrupted the social group. Even though they were honest, the act itself is problematic because it involves a personal relationship between someone and their friend's parent. The author might not be legally wrong, but socially and ethically, they might be considered at fault because they prioritized their own desires over their friend's feelings and the integrity of their friendship.\n\nAlso, considering the mother's situation\u2014divorced, living with her adult child\u2014it's possible that she's vulnerable or seeking companionship, which the author could have recognized as inappropriate. The fact that the relationship is causing the friend to start a smear campaign suggests the author's actions are leading to broader negative consequences beyond just the immediate parties involved.\n\nSo, putting it all together, even if the author was upfront, the act itself is ethically questionable and likely makes them at fault. The answer is probably A.\n"
