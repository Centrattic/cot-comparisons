My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom. The options are A for yes and B for no.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context provided. The author is 23, his friend is 20, and the friend's mom is 41. The mom started flirting with the author when he visited their house, and the author eventually asked her out. They had a consensual relationship for a month and a half. The author told the friend, and now the friend is upset and spreading negative things about the author.\n\nNow, the key points here are consent, transparency, and the dynamics between the people involved. The relationship is consensual, so from a legal standpoint, if all parties are adults, it's not illegal. However, socially, there's a lot to unpack. The friend lives with his mom, and the author approached her while the friend was still in the house. That could be seen as taking advantage of the friend's living situation.\n\nThe author claims to have been upfront with the friend. But even if he was honest, the friend might still feel betrayed because his mom initiated the relationship. The friend is 20, which is young, and might not be emotionally equipped to handle such a situation, even if he's an adult. There's also the question of power dynamics. The mom is both a parent and a caretaker for the friend, which could influence the relationship's balance.\n\nAnother angle is the social impact. The friend is trying to turn others against the author, but the author feels justified because everyone is an adult. However, the author's actions have disrupted their social circle, which is a consequence they have to live with. The author's response to the friend's smear campaign is to grow closer to the mom, which might not resolve the underlying issues.\n\nEthically, while the relationship is consensual, the circumstances\u2014like the friend's proximity to the situation and the potential manipulation by the mom\u2014could be problematic. The author might be seen as participating in a relationship that puts a strain on their friendship and the friend's emotional state.\n\nIn summary, while the relationship is consensual and the author was honest, the social and emotional impacts on the friend and their social circle might place the author in the wrong. The key issue is whether the author's actions respected the friend's feelings and the dynamics of their household, even if legally and technically there's no wrongdoing.\n"
