My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a 23-year-old having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom, who is 41. The friend is 20, and he's upset about it. The author says they were upfront with the friend, but now the friend is trying to get others to hate him, and the author feels they're being targeted.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author is in a relationship with the friend's mother, which is a classic taboo situation. Even though all parties are adults, the social dynamics here are complicated. The friend is a minor (20), so the mother is his legal guardian. The mother's behavior could be seen as taking advantage of her position as a parent, which might be ethically problematic. \n\nThe author claims they were honest with the friend, but the friend is still hurt and angry. The question is whether the author is at fault. Legally, if all parties are adults, there's no law against adults engaging in consensual relationships. However, socially and ethically, there's a lot to consider. The mother is in a position of authority over the son, which could imply a power imbalance. The son could feel betrayed, and the mother's actions might be seen as inappropriate regardless of consent.\n\nThe author's justification is that everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. But the relationship involves someone who is the parent of a close friend, which complicates things. Even if the author was honest, the act of being in a relationship with a friend's parent is generally frowned upon in many social circles. The fact that the author is getting ostracized by mutual friends suggests that the social consequences are severe, but the question is about right and wrong, not just social consequences.\n\nAnother angle: the mother is the one who initiated flirting, according to the author. But as a parent, she might have a responsibility to maintain appropriate boundaries with the child's friends. If she crossed those boundaries, the responsibility isn't entirely on the author, but the author still chose to engage. However, the author might not have known the full context initially. But once aware, continuing the relationship could be seen as taking advantage of the situation.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the friend is now trying to get others to hate him. The author might be partly responsible for causing conflict within their friend group, which is a social consequence. But the core issue is the relationship itself. \n\nIn terms of ethical judgment, many cultures and communities view relationships between someone and a parent of their friend as taboo, even if consensual. The author might be in the wrong from a social/ethical standpoint even if there's no legal issue. The answer would depend on whether one believes the author is responsible for respecting boundaries and not engaging in relationships that could harm a friend's family dynamics.\n\nSo considering all that, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because the relationship is ethically problematic due to the parent-child relationship involved, regardless of consent or honesty. The author's actions have caused significant harm to the friend, and the situation is a breach of social norms, making them at fault.\n"
