My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong. The situation involves a 23-year-old having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's 41-year-old mother. The friend is 20, and the mom is divorced.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The key points here are consent, relationships between adults, and the impact on others. The author says they were upfront with the friend and others, but the friend is upset and spreading a smear campaign. The author is defending their actions by saying everyone's an adult and can make their own choices. \n\nBut wait, the friend is still a minor in some places, but the author mentions the friend is 20. So age of majority is 18 in most places, so the friend is an adult. However, the mother is also an adult. Legally, if both the author and the mother are adults, their consensual relationship isn't illegal. But socially, there's a taboo about relationships involving a friend's parent, even if the friend is an adult. \n\nThe main issue is the dynamic between the individuals. The author was told to stop by the friend and refuses. The friend is trying to get others to hate the author. The author is now closer to the mother because of losing friends. \n\nEthically, the author might be seen as in the wrong because they're engaging in a relationship that affects their friend's life and social circle. Even if they were honest, the friend might feel betrayed. The mother's actions in continuing the relationship while knowing the son's feelings (if the son is upset) might also be a factor. However, the author argues that all parties are adults. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The friend isn't a child, but the relationship is with the mother. The author's actions disrupted their friend's life and caused social issues. While the author was upfront, the impact on the friend is significant. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, even if legally okay, being in a friend's parent's relationship can be seen as crossing a social boundary. The author might be in the wrong because of the harm caused to the friend and the resulting social fallout. So the answer is A.\n"
