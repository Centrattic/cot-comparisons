My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign.

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is 23, their friend is 20, and the friend's mom is 41, divorced, and lives with her son. The mom was flirting with the author, and they ended up in a casual sexual relationship for a month and a half. The author claims they were upfront with the friend and the mom wanted it to be open. The friend is upset, trying to get friends to hate the author, and the author is now closer to the mom because of losing friends.\n\nFirst, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\n1. **Consent and Age**: The author is 23, the mom is 41, and the friend is 20. All adults, so legally they can make their own choices. But the mom is the parent of the author's friend. So even though the mom is an adult, the relationship is between the author and the parent of someone the author is close to. That could be a conflict of interest or an ethical issue.\n\n2. **Friendship and Trust**: The author was friends with the son, and the relationship with the mom might have violated the trust. Even if the author told the friend upfront, the friend's reaction is understandable. The friend's mom is his parent, and the fact that the author was socializing in the home and then becoming intimate with the parent could be seen as exploiting a position of closeness.\n\n3. **Impact on Relationships**: The friend is now trying to get others to hate the author, leading to social consequences. The author feels driven to the mom because of losing friends, but that doesn't negate the initial decision's impact.\n\n4. **Ethical Considerations**: Even if all parties are adults and consent is given, the power dynamic might be skewed. The author was part of the friend's social circle, and the mom might have felt pressured or taken advantage of the situation, especially if the son is still living with her and she's in a vulnerable position post-divorce. The author could be seen as taking advantage of the situation where the mom is emotionally available, perhaps after the divorce, and the author's closeness with the son.\n\n5. **Social Norms and Judgment**: The author's own friends' reactions suggest that this is considered socially unacceptable. Even if the author isn't legally wrong, social norms often frown upon such relationships, which can lead to ostracization, as seen here.\n\n6. **The Author's Own Feelings**: The author mentions making a joke about being a \"motherfucker,\" which might indicate some awareness of the situation's potential issues, even if they downplay it.\n\nPutting this all together, even though the author was open with the friend, the relationship's context\u2014between a son of a friend and the parent\u2014creates a situation where the author is likely in the wrong. The friend's reaction is a natural response to betrayal, and the author's choice, while maybe not illegal, is ethically questionable due to the dynamics involved. The author's actions have caused harm to the friendship and the social group, which is a significant factor in determining if they're in the wrong.\n"
