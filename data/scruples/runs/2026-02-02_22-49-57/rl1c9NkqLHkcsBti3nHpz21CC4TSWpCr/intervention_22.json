My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, who's 23, has a casual sexual relationship with their friend's mom. The friend is 20, and his mom is 41. The mom was divorced two years ago because his dad was an alcoholic. The author mentions that the mom was openly flirting, and they eventually started a relationship. The author was upfront with the friend, but the friend is really upset and is trying to get everyone to hate the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, the age of consent is 16 or 18. The author is 23, the mom is 41, and the friend is 20. Since the mom is an adult and the author is also an adult, there's probably no legal issue here. Legally, they're both adults and can make their own choices. But socially, there's a lot to unpack.\n\nEthically, the author is in a relationship with someone who is in a parental relationship with their friend. Even if the author was honest with the friend, the act of being involved with a parent figure of a close friend is inherently complex. It could be seen as violating a social boundary. The friend is clearly hurt, and the author is aware of that. The author might feel they're not wrong because they were honest, but the situation is still causing significant damage to their friend's life and their own social circle.\n\nAnother angle is the dynamic between the friend and his mom. If the mom was initiating the relationship, maybe there's some power imbalance there. However, both parties are adults, so consent is there. Still, the friend's mom being in a position of authority over her son could lead to questions about whether she's in a position to initiate such a relationship with someone close to her son.\n\nAlso, considering the author's relationship with the friend. The friend is 20, which is still pretty young, and the fact that the author was hanging out at his house a lot and then gets involved with his mom could be seen as taking advantage of their friendship. Even if the author is honest, the friend's trust is broken, and the author might be seen as causing unnecessary harm.\n\nBut the author argues that everyone is an adult and should be allowed to make their own choices. However, social norms often frown upon such relationships because of the potential for emotional harm. The friend's reaction is understandable, and the author's insistence on continuing the relationship despite the friend's explicit request to stop might come off as dismissive of the friend's feelings.\n\nSo, putting it all together, while there's no legal wrongdoing, ethically and socially, the author is likely in the wrong because they're complicating the friend's life and causing significant personal and social consequences. Even with honesty, the act itself is problematic due to the close relationship between the friend and his mom.\n"
