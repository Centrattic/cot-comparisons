My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author is 23, and their 20-year-old friend lives with his mom, who's 41. The friend's mom is divorced and they started a casual sexual relationship after she started flirting with the author. The author was upfront with the friend, but the friend is upset and spreading hate. The author is now closer to the mom because they're losing friends.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The main issue is the relationship between the author and the friend's mom. The friend is 20, which is an adult age, but maybe the author is taking advantage of his position. The mom is 41, so she's an adult. The author claims they were honest with the friend, but the friend is still upset and trying to get others to hate the author.\n\nLegally, both are adults, so consensual relations between adults are legal. But socially and ethically, there's a lot to unpack. The friend is 20, so he's still in a vulnerable position living with his mom. The author might be seen as taking advantage of the situation, especially since the friend is his friend. Even if the author was honest, the act of pursuing a relationship with a friend's parent could be seen as crossing a line. The fact that the friend is trying to get friends to hate the author shows how hurt he is, which might indicate that the author's actions were hurtful regardless of legality.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the mother was the one initiating the flirting and stepping up the interactions. But even so, the author is still in a position where pursuing a relationship with their friend's mom could be seen as taking advantage of the trust and friendship. The author's argument is that everyone is an adult, but relationships can have complex social implications beyond just legal consent.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on the friend. Even if the author was honest, the friend's reaction suggests that the relationship is causing significant emotional distress. The author might be prioritizing their own desires over the friend's feelings, which could be seen as selfish. The fact that the author is now closer to the mom because of losing friends might also indicate a lack of empathy towards the friend's perspective.\n\nIn terms of ethics, while there's no law against it, societal norms often frown upon such relationships, especially when it affects friendships. The author might not be in the legal wrong, but morally, there's a question about whether they respected the boundaries and the friend's feelings. The key here is the impact on the friend and the social dynamics, not just the consent between the author and the mom.\n\nSo considering all these factors, even though the author was honest, the situation is complex. The answer might depend on whether the action is seen as crossing a social boundary despite legal consent. The friend's age (20) and the author's role as a friend could lead to the conclusion that the author is in the wrong socially, even if legally they aren't. Therefore, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) from a social/ethical perspective.\n"
