My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for having a casual sexual relationship with their friend's mom. The situation involves multiple people: the author (23), the friend (20), and the friend's mom (41), who's divorced and lives with her son.\n\nFirst, the friend is 20, so he's a legal adult, but he's still living with his mom. The mom is 41, so she's also an adult. The key points here are the dynamics between the people involved. The author was initially just friends with the son, but the mom started flirting. They eventually had a casual relationship, and the author was upfront with the son. The son is upset and is trying to get others to hate the author, which has succeeded somewhat.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main ethical considerations here would be about consent, boundaries, and the potential impact on relationships. All parties are adults, so legally, they can make their own choices. However, the son is 20 and might still feel a sense of loyalty or protectiveness towards his mother, making the situation socially complicated.\n\nThe author claims they were honest with the son. But even if they were, the son's reaction is understandable given the familial relationship. The author's decision to continue the relationship despite the son's objections could be seen as disregarding his feelings, even if the son isn't the legal parent. The son living with his mom adds another layer because the author is now engaging with someone in a household where the son is present.\n\nWhile the author might argue that all parties are adults and it's a consensual adult relationship, the social and emotional impact on the son is significant. The son's efforts to distance his friends from the author are problematic, but that doesn't necessarily clear the author of wrongdoing. The author's actions have caused a rift in the social circle, and the fact that they were upfront doesn't negate the potential harm caused to the son and the group.\n\nIn terms of societal norms and ethics, entering a relationship with someone's parent can be seen as crossing a boundary, even if legally permissible. The author's decision to continue despite the son's objections might be viewed as prioritizing their own desires over the son's well-being and the group's dynamics. Therefore, the author could be considered in the wrong, even if they were honest, because they disregarded the son's feelings and the potential for causing harm.\n"
