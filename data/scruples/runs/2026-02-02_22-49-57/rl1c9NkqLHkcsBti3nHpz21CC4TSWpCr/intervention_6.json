My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation involves a 23-year-old guy who's in a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom, who's 41 and divorced. The friend is 20 and upset about it.\n\nFirst, legal age of consent here is a factor. In most places, the age of consent is 16 or 18, so 23 and 41 are both adults. Legally, that's not the issue. But ethically and socially, it's more complicated. The friend is 20, still pretty young, even if he's an adult. The mom was initially flirting with the friend's house, but the user was aware of the friend's relationship with her. The user says he was upfront with the friend, but the friend is upset and trying to get others to hate him.\n\nThe user's main points are: everyone's an adult, he was honest, so he doesn't think he's wrong. The person is defending his actions by saying it's about adult choices. But here's the thing\u2014there's a power dynamic here. The mom is the parent of the friend, so when the user started a relationship with her, especially while still being friends with her son, that could create a conflict of interest. The friend feels betrayed, and even if the user was honest, the friend's trust is broken. Also, the user is close to the friend's family, so the relationship might affect their social circle and the friend's well-being.\n\nAnother angle is cultural norms. In many societies, relationships with a friend's parent are seen as taboo, even if legally okay. The user might not be doing anything illegal, but socially, people might judge him harshly. The fact that the friend is trying to get friends to hate him and the user is losing friends suggests that the community sees this as a problem. The user might not be in the wrong legally, but socially and ethically, it's a gray area. The user's choice to continue despite the friend's objections might be seen as dismissive of the friend's feelings. Even if the user was honest, the impact on the friend's life is significant. The user could be seen as prioritizing his own desires over the friend's well-being, which might make him the asshole in the eyes of others.\n\nSo, considering all that, even though the user followed legal guidelines and was honest, the social and emotional impact on the friend and their social circle might place the blame on the user. Therefore, the answer could be A (the author is in the wrong) because the relationship causes significant harm to the friend and disrupts their social network, regardless of the adults being involved.\n"
