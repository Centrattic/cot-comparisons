My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a 23-year-old having a casual sexual relationship with their friend's mom, who is 41. The friend is 20, and he's upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key factors here. The age of consent is important. In most places, 18 is the age of majority, so the 20-year-old friend is an adult, but the relationship is between the 23-year-old and the 41-year-old. So legally, there's no issue there. However, the friend is still a minor in some contexts, depending on the jurisdiction. Wait, actually, in most places, 21 isn't the age of majority. Let me check: In the US, the age of majority is 18, so the friend is an adult. But there's also the issue of the relationship being between someone and their friend's parent. \n\nNext, the dynamics of the situation. The author mentions that the friend's mom was openly flirting, and he took the initiative. He approached her, and she agreed. He was upfront with the friend. The friend is upset and is trying to turn others against him. The author is now isolated and closer to the mom because of it. \n\nEthically, even if legal, relationships with a friend's parent can be problematic. The question is whether the author is wrong for pursuing a relationship with his friend's mother despite the friend's disapproval. The author argues that everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. However, the friend is also an adult, and the relationship could affect their dynamic. \n\nThe author's actions might be considered wrong because it could damage the friendship and the friend's trust. Even if the author was honest with the friend, the friend might still feel betrayed. There's also the aspect of the mother's role as a parent figure, even if not by blood. Social norms often frown upon such relationships because of the potential for emotional harm and the existing family dynamics. \n\nBut then again, if the author was upfront and the friend is still acting out, maybe the wrong is not entirely on the author. The key is whether the author acted responsibly. Since he was honest with the friend, that's a point in his favor. However, the initial decision to pursue the relationship with a friend's parent is ethically questionable regardless of honesty. The author might be in the wrong for not considering the emotional impact on the friend, even if they are adults. \n\nIn some cases, even if legal, relationships with a friend's parent can lead to long-term issues. The fact that the friend is now spreading a smear campaign suggests the author's actions have caused significant harm. The author's decision to continue despite the friend's wishes might also be seen as disrespectful to the friend's feelings. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A). Because while they may have been honest, the relationship itself is problematic due to the existing friendship and the potential for emotional harm. The friend's mom's role as a parent figure and the impact on the friendship make the author's actions ethically questionable.\n"
