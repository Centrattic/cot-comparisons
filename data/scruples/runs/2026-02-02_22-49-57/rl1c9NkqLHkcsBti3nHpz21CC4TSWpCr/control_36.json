My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who described the situation is in the wrong. They provided a detailed scenario from the Reddit-style \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) format.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The person is 23, their friend is 20, and the friend's mother is 41. The mother is divorced, and the friend is living with her. The author mentions that the mother was openly flirtatious, and they ended up in a casual sexual relationship. The friend found out, is upset, and is trying to get others to avoid the author. The author is defending their actions by saying everyone is an adult and they were upfront with the friend.\n\nNow, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (Yes) or B (No). I need to evaluate based on social norms, ethics, and possibly legal aspects. \n\nFrom a social standpoint, relationships between an adult and someone who is close in age to their child's friend can be problematic. Even though the author claims they were upfront with the friend, the situation involves a power dynamic. The mother is in a position of authority over the son in terms of living arrangements, which might affect the son's ability to be objective or the perception of consent. However, both the author and the mother are legal adults, so legally, there's no crime unless there's some kind of abuse of position or coercion that's not mentioned here.\n\nEthically, the main issue is the disruption of the friend's life and the potential exploitation. The son is young, and the mother could be seen as taking advantage of her position. Also, the author's decision to continue the relationship despite the friend's objections shows a lack of consideration for the friend's feelings and social standing. The fact that the author made the situation public and is now being ostracized complicates things further.\n\nAnother angle is the nature of the relationship being \"casual.\" The author might not see it as serious, but the impact on the friend is significant. The friend feels betrayed and is actively trying to isolate the author. The author's argument that adults can make their own choices holds in a legal sense but might not in a social or ethical context, especially in a close-knit group where the son's feelings are hurt.\n\nAlso, the author's comment about making a joke about being a \"motherfucker\" seems to trivialize the situation, which might indicate they're not taking the friend's feelings seriously. \n\nConsidering all these factors, the consensus in such AITA threads often leans towards the person who engaged in the relationship being in the wrong if it caused significant harm to the other party. The fact that the author was upfront with the friend might mitigate some blame, but the ongoing conflict and the friend's smear campaign suggest that the author's actions had a negative impact that they didn't fully anticipate or care to respect.\n\nSo, even though legally there's no wrongdoing, socially and ethically, the author might be at fault for not respecting the friend's boundaries and causing lasting damage to their relationships.\n"
