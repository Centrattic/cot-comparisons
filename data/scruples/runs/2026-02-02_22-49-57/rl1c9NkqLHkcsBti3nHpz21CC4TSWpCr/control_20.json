My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a 23-year-old having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's 41-year-old mom. The friend is 20 and upset about it, leading to social issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ages. The author is 23, the friend is 20, and the mom is 41. Legally, in many places, the age of consent is 18, so 23 is well above that. But there's a power dynamic here. The mom is the friend's parent, which adds complexity. Even though they're adults, relationships with someone's parent can be socially sensitive, especially when the parent is a parent figure to their friend.\n\nNext, the author claims to be upfront with the friend. They asked him directly, and the friend was put off. The mom insisted on the friend knowing, so the author was honest. But even if they're honest, the friend is still upset and trying to get others to dislike the author. The author feels like they're not in the wrong because everyone is an adult and can make their own choices.\n\nBut there's the aspect of the friend's emotional state. The friend is young (20), and his mom is divorced. It's possible the friend feels betrayed or hurt because someone he's close to is involved with his mother. Even if the author isn't the direct cause of the divorce, being with his mom could be a sensitive issue for him.\n\nSocially, relationships with someone's parent are often frowned upon, especially if it's a close friend. The mom might be seeing the author as a way to have attention outside the family, but it's affecting the son's life. The author might be right in thinking adults can make their own choices, but the friend is still a key person here, and the author's actions are causing him significant distress.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the mom was flirting with him, and they escalated the situation. The question is whether the author should have recognized the potential harm to the friend even if it's consensual between them. There's a responsibility in social circles to consider how your actions affect others, even if those others aren't directly involved in the relationship.\n\nSo, while the relationship might be legally and technically consensual, the social and emotional impact on the friend is significant. The author might not be \"in the wrong\" legally, but socially and in terms of interpersonal relationships, they could be seen as in the wrong because they're causing distress to a close friend. The fact that the friend is trying to turn others against the author suggests the situation is causing real damage to their social group, which could reflect poorly on the author's judgment in pursuing the relationship despite knowing it would upset the friend.\n"
