My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a 23-year-old having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom, who's 41. The friend is 20 and upset, leading to social circle issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age of the friend. The friend is 20, which is just 3 years younger than the author. But the mom is the parent of the friend, so there's a parental relationship involved. The author says he was upfront with the friend. The friend is upset and trying to get others to hate the author.\n\nLegally, both the author and the mom are adults, so there's no legal issue. But socially, it's more complicated. The key here is the relationship with the friend. The author's friend is the son of the person he's dating, so there's a family connection. Even if the author was honest, the friend's feelings are valid. The friend might feel betrayed, and the author's actions could be seen as taking advantage of a vulnerable situation. \n\nEven if the mom initiated the flirting, the author's decision to engage and continue the relationship, especially knowing the friend's feelings, might be the problem. The author might be ignoring the friend's discomfort and the potential emotional impact on him. The fact that the friend is trying to turn others against the author shows how damaging this is to their friendship and social circle.\n\nThe author says he's being open with the friend, but maybe that's not enough. The friend might not want to be involved in the relationship at all. Also, the author is now distancing from the friend's mom, which might not resolve the friend's anger. The core issue is the relationship with the friend's mom, which is a sensitive situation regardless of the ages.\n\nSo, while there's no legal wrong, socially and ethically, the author is in a complicated position. The friend's feelings matter, and the author might not have considered the long-term impact on the friend's trust and their social group. Therefore, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong.\n"
