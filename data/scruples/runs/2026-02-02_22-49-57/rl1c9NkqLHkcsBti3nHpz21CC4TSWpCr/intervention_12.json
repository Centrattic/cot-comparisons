My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having a casual sexual relationship with their friend's mom. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author is 23, their friend is 20, living with his divorced mom who's 41. The mom was flirting, and the author ended up in a casual relationship. They told the friend, but the friend is upset and trying to get others to hate the author.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent and age. Both the author and the mom are adults, so legally, this is okay. The mom is 41, so she's an adult, and the author is 23. There's no legal issue there. \n\nThe friend is 20, which is also an adult, but he's upset. The author did tell him upfront, which is good. The problem seems to be the social dynamics and the friend's reaction, not the legality or consent. \n\nNow, the question is about moral or social wrongness. Even though everyone is an adult, there's a taboo around relationships with someone's parent, especially if there's a power dynamic. The mom was the one initiating the flirting, so maybe the author isn't the one who started it. But the author did take the step to ask her out. \n\nThe author is in a casual relationship, which the friend finds offensive. The friend is trying to ostracize the author, but the author argues that adults can make their own choices. \n\nSo, from a legal standpoint, no issue. From a moral/ethical perspective, some people might say it's inappropriate because of the relationship with the friend and the mom's status as a parent figure. However, others might say it's the friend overreacting. \n\nThe author was honest with the friend, which is important. The mom's actions might have been a choice, but the friend is still hurt. The author's actions didn't force the relationship; the mom was the one initiating. \n\nBut the core issue is whether the author is in the wrong. Since all parties are adults and consent was given, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The problem comes from the friend's reaction and the social fallout, not the act itself. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
