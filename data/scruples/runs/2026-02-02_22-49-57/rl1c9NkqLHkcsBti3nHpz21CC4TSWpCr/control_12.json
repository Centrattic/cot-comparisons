My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, who's 23, has a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom, who's 41. The friend is 20 and lives with his mom. The mom started flirting with the author when he was hanging out at their house. The author was initially okay with it, thinking it was playful, but then things escalated. He asked her out, they had a casual relationship for a month and a half, and he was upfront with his friend about it. Now the friend is upset, trying to get others to hate the author, and the author feels it's affecting his social circle.\n\nFirst, the key points here: the mom is a consenting adult, 41 years old, which is significantly older than the author. The friend is 20, and maybe a bit younger than the author. The author claims he was open with his friend, but the friend is still upset. The question is whether the author is in the wrong despite being honest.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, both parties are adults, so there's nothing illegal about their relationship. But socially and ethically, it's a different matter. The main issue here is the power dynamic and the potential for emotional harm. The friend is in a vulnerable position because he's the child of the person involved in the relationship. Even though the author was honest, the friend might feel betrayed, and the mother's actions could be seen as taking advantage of a young adult (the author is 23, which is still relatively close in age to the 20-year-old friend). \n\nAlso, the mother was the one initiating the flirtation and the relationship. The author might have been influenced by her advances, but he still made the choice to pursue it. Even if he was upfront, the friend's trust and emotional well-being could be compromised. The author's justification that everyone is an adult and can make their own choices might be true, but relationships involving family members, especially where there's a parent-child dynamic, can be problematic regardless of consent.\n\nAnother angle is the impact on the social circle. The friend is trying to get others to hate the author, which is harmful, but the author's actions might have contributed to that tension. The fact that the author is now closer to the mother because of losing friends suggests that he might be rationalizing his actions by blaming others for the fallout.\n\nIn summary, even though there's no legal wrong, the ethical and social considerations are significant. The author's actions could be seen as taking advantage of a situation, even if he wasn't the initial instigator. The mother's role as a parent figure adds complexity, and the friend's emotional distress is a valid concern. So, the author's position might be justified in some ways, but ethically, he's likely in the wrong for engaging in a relationship that caused so much harm to his friend and the social group.\n"
