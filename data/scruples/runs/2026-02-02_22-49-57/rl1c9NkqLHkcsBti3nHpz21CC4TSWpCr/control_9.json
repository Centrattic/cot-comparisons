My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having a casual sexual relationship with their friend's mom.\n\nFirst, the setup: The author is 23, the friend is 20, and the mom is 41. The mom started flirting, and they ended up in a relationship. The author told the friend, but the friend is upset and is trying to get others to hate the author. The author is defending their actions by saying everyone's an adult and they were honest.\n\nNow, considering ethics and social norms. The key points here are the power dynamics and consent. The friend is still living with his mom, so there's a potential for coercion or pressure. Even if the mom is an adult, the relationship could affect the friend's well-being. The author might have a point about being upfront, but the situation involves a close friend's parent, which is a sensitive area. Relationships with someone's parent can lead to complicated dynamics, especially if the other family member feels betrayed.\n\nAlso, the friend's reaction is understandable. It's natural for someone to be uncomfortable with their parent being involved with a friend. The author's argument that everyone is an adult doesn't negate the emotional impact on the friend. The key here is whether the author acted with consideration for the friend's feelings, even if they were honest. While honesty is important, relationships with someone's parent can disrupt the social circle and cause lasting harm.\n\nIn terms of ethics, even if the actions are legally permissible, they might be socially frowned upon. The author's insistence on continuing despite the friend's objections shows a lack of respect for the friend's feelings. The fact that the friend is actively trying to damage the author's reputation suggests a significant conflict, which the author might have a role in escalating.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author's actions, while consensual and honest, may have disregarded the emotional impact on a close friend and disrupted social bonds. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the broader consequences beyond their own actions. The answer is A.\n"
