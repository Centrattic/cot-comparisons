My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation.\n\nThe person is 23, their friend is 20, and he lives with his mom, who is 41. The friend's mom started flirting with them, and they ended up in a casual sexual relationship. They told their friend, but the friend is upset and is trying to get others to turn against them. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author's friend is 20, which is an adult, but maybe still young and not used to such a situation. The mom is 41, so she's an adult. The author is 23, also an adult. However, there's a power dynamic because the author is in a close relationship with the son. Even if they were upfront, the act of being with someone's parent can be sensitive, especially when the child is still part of the family.\n\nEthically, it's complicated. All parties are adults, so legally, there's no issue. But socially and emotionally, it's a different story. The author might be in the wrong because they're part of the friend's social circle and their actions are affecting the friend's family. The friend's reaction is understandable\u2014he might feel betrayed or hurt, even if he's an adult. The author's decision to continue the relationship despite the friend's objections could be seen as insensitive. Also, the fact that the friend is trying to get others to hate the author suggests that the situation is causing significant harm to their social circle. The author might have not considered the emotional impact on the friend, even if they were honest. So, while there's no legal fault, the social and emotional implications could place the author at fault. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
