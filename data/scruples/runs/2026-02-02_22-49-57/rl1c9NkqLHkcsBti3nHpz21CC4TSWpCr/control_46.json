My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a 23-year-old having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's 41-year-old mom. The friend is 20 and upset, leading to social issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend is still living with his mom, and the mother initiated flirting. The author claims they were upfront with the friend. But the key question is whether this is wrong regardless of consent. \n\nLegally, all parties are adults, so there's no issue there. But socially and ethically, it's more complex. The mother is the friend's parent, so there's a family relationship. Even if the mother and the author are both adults, engaging in a relationship with someone's parent, especially when the child is close in age to the other person, can be seen as crossing a boundary.\n\nThe friend is upset and trying to get others to dislike the author. The author is arguing that everyone is an adult and should make their own choices. However, the mother might have a power dynamic over her son, especially since she's his parent and he lives with her. There's also the aspect of the mother's role in the friend's life. Even if the mother initiates, the son might feel violated or uncomfortable, which is a valid emotional response.\n\nThe author says they were honest with the friend, but honesty doesn't necessarily excuse the action if it's socially unacceptable. The friends' reactions suggest that the community sees this as wrong. Also, the author mentions that the relationship has driven them closer to the mother because of losing friends, which complicates the situation further.\n\nI need to consider if the author is overstepping social boundaries, even if there's no legal wrongdoing. Relationships with family members' parents can be seen as taboo, and the friend's distress is significant. Even if the author was upfront, the act itself is likely to cause social repercussions, which the friend is now doing.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the action is respectful and considerate of others' feelings. Here, the author might be seen as inconsiderate of the friend's feelings and the potential harm to their relationship. So, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because of the social and familial boundaries crossed, even if everyone is technically an adult.\n"
