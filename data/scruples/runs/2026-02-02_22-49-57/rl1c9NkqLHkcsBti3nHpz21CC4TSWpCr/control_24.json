My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is 23, their friend is 20, and the friend's mom is 41. The mom is divorced, and the author started a casual sexual relationship with her after she was flirting with him. The author mentioned being upfront with the friend, but the friend is upset and trying to get others to dislike the author. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nHmm. The key points here are consent and the dynamics between the people involved. The mom is an adult, so legally, there's no issue with the relationship itself. But socially, there's a problem because it's the friend's mom. Even though the author was honest with the friend, the friend feels betrayed. The author might not be legally wrong, but socially and emotionally, they've caused issues. \n\nThe friend's mom initiated the flirting, but the author still chose to pursue a relationship. The author's actions directly affected their friend's feelings and social circle. Even if everyone is an adult, relationships with someone's parent can be sensitive. The author might not be in the wrong legally or morally if they were honest, but they should consider the friend's feelings and the potential fallout. However, the author's decision to continue despite the friend's discomfort could be seen as dismissive. \n\nBut the question is whether they're in the wrong. If they were upfront and honest, maybe they're not wrong, but the situation is still problematic. The answer might be that they are in the wrong because they disregarded their friend's feelings and caused harm, even if they were honest. Alternatively, since it's a consensual adult relationship, they might not be at fault. \n\nI think the main issue is the social dynamics. Even if consensual, the author's actions have damaged their friendship and caused a rift. So, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they didn't consider the impact on their friend's feelings and the social circle, even if they were honest. But some might argue it's not their fault since it's a consensual relationship. Hmm.\n"
