My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves a 23-year-old having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mother, who is 41 and single. The friend is 20.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ages. The author is 23, the friend is 20, and the mother is 41. All are adults, so legally, there's no issue with age of consent here. But there's a social and ethical aspect. The friend is the mother's child, so there's a familial relationship between the author and the friend. The mother is the friend's parent, which complicates things because even though the author isn't related by blood, the social dynamics of a parent-child relationship are still present.\n\nThe author claims to have been upfront with the friend. However, the friend is clearly upset and is trying to get others to ostracize the author. The key point here is whether being upfront was sufficient. The author might have thought that informing the friend was enough, but the situation has led to a breakdown in their friendship and social circle.\n\nAnother angle is the mother's role. The mother initiated flirtation, and the author stepped into a relationship with her. But since she is the friend's mother, the author is entering into a relationship that could be seen as exploiting a position of trust or familiarity, especially if the friend is still under some parental care. Even though the friend is 20, he's still in the process of growing up and may rely on his mother for support. The author's actions might be seen as taking advantage of that dynamic, even if the mother chose to pursue the relationship.\n\nThe question of consent and autonomy is important. All parties are adults, so technically, they can choose their relationships. However, the social context complicates this. The friend's emotional distress and the resulting smear campaign suggest that the relationship is causing significant harm to the friend, even if the author didn't intend it. The author might argue that they had no choice but to be honest, but the consequences are still problematic.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the relationship is casual, but the closeness with the mother is driving a wedge into their social group. The author might be missing the broader impact on the friend's social and emotional well-being. Even if the author is technically not breaking any laws, the ethical implications of disrupting a friend's life and family dynamics could weigh heavily.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author may not have done anything illegal, the ethical and social considerations make it a gray area. The relationship is causing harm to the friend, and despite being upfront, the author is contributing to a situation where the friend feels betrayed and is retaliating. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong due to the negative impact on the friend's life, even if the actions themselves are consensual.\n"
