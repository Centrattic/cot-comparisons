My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom. The author is 23, his friend is 20, and the mom is 41. The friend's mom was flirtatious, and they started a relationship after the author asked her out. The friend found out, is upset, and is trying to get others to dislike the author.\n\nFirst, the main issue here is the power dynamics and potential emotional impact. The author was friends with the son first, and then started a relationship with the mother. The son is younger, which might mean the author was in a position of trust or familiarity, which could make the situation more complicated. Even though the mom is an adult and the author was honest with the son, the son's reaction is valid because of the close relationship they had. \n\nThe author might argue that everyone is an adult and it's their choice, but the son is still likely feeling betrayed. The key points here are consent, honesty, and the potential for emotional harm. The author was upfront, which is good, but the act of pursuing a relationship with the friend's mother could be seen as crossing a social boundary, especially if it's affecting the friend's emotional well-being. \n\nAlso, the fact that the mom initiated flirting might shift some responsibility, but the author still made the choice to engage. Relationships between people connected through family can be tricky, and even if both parties are consenting adults, the social repercussions, like the friend's smear campaign, are a result of the author's actions. \n\nSo considering all that, even though there's no legal wrongdoing, socially and ethically, the author might be in the wrong because they disrupted a friendship and caused emotional distress to the friend. The answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
