My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author, who's 23, has a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom, who's 41. The friend is 20 and lives with his mom. The mom started flirting with the author when they were at her house, and after some back and forth, they ended up in a relationship. The author says he was upfront with his friend, but the friend is upset and spreading a smear campaign against him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, the age of consent is 18, so the mom is 41 and the author is 23. Legally, that's okay. The friend is 20, but he's not the one involved in the relationship, so his age isn't directly relevant here. So legally, there's no issue.\n\nNext, the ethics. The mom is a consenting adult, and the author is also an adult. The fact that the mom is the friend's mother complicates things because of the existing family relationship. The friend is part of the mom's household, even though they're divorced. The author might be seen as taking advantage of a vulnerable situation, especially considering the friend's emotional state after his parents' divorce. The mom's divorce was due to the dad's alcoholism, which might affect the dynamics here.\n\nThe author says he was honest with the friend, which is a positive point. Honesty is important in maintaining trust, even if the situation is awkward. However, the fact that the friend is now spreading a smear campaign suggests that the situation is causing significant harm to the friend's social circle and personal relationships. The author might be contributing to the friend's distress, even if he didn't intend to.\n\nAnother angle: power dynamics. The mom is the friend's mother, so there could be a power imbalance if she's in a position to influence or pressure the author. However, the author also made the choice to engage in the relationship, so mutual consent is a factor here.\n\nSocial norms and societal expectations play a role too. Relationships between adults who are closely connected through family, even if not blood-related, can be frowned upon. This is more about social acceptability than legality. The author's actions might disrupt the friend's family and social life, leading to the current conflict.\n\nThe author's justification is that everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. While that's true, the consequences of those choices can affect others, especially when it comes to family relationships. The friend's emotional response is understandable, given the personal connection to the person he's close with.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's actions might not be legally wrong, ethically and socially, he's in a complicated position. The key factors are the consent of all parties involved, honesty, and the impact on the friend's well-being. The author might not be in the wrong from a legal standpoint, but socially, he's causing harm that's hard to ignore. So, there's a case for both sides, but given the context, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong because of the disruption and the potential for exploitation despite mutual consent.\n"
