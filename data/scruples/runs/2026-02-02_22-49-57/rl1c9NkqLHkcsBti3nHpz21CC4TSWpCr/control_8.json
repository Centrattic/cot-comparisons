My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having a casual sexual relationship with their friend's mother. The situation involves multiple parties: the 23-year-old author, his 20-year-old friend, and the friend's 41-year-old mother.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother was openly flirting, and the author took the initiative to ask her out. Both parties are adults, so legally there's no issue. However, the friend is upset and spreading a smear campaign. The author claims to be honest with the friend, but the friend still feels betrayed. \n\nThe key points here are consent and boundaries. Legally, adults can make their own sexual choices. However, socially, there's a taboo around relationships with someone's parent, especially if the child is a friend. The author might have crossed a social boundary, leading to the friend's anger. The question is whether the author acted inconsiderately despite the friend's feelings. Even if the author was honest, the act itself could be seen as disrespectful to the friend, potentially causing lasting damage to friendships. \n\nThe mother's age and the friend's age (20) might not matter legally, but the relationship's impact on the friend's life and social circle is significant. The author's decision to continue the relationship despite the friend's objections shows a lack of empathy towards the friend's feelings. The smear campaign and loss of friends indicate that the author's actions have real-world consequences beyond just the legal or consensual aspects.\n\nSo, while the author isn't breaking laws, they might be in the wrong socially and ethically for disregarding their friend's emotional state and the potential damage to their friendship. The answer leans towards yes, the author is in the wrong because they ignored the friend's feelings and the social repercussions, even if the relationship was consensual.\n"
