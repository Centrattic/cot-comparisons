My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having a casual sexual relationship with their friend's mom. The situation is a bit complicated.\n\nFirst, the author is 23, their friend is 20, and his mom is 41. The mom started flirting with the author when they were hanging out at the friend's house. The author initially thought it was playful, but the mom kept up the flirting when they were alone. The author asked her out, and they've had a casual relationship for a month and a half. The author was open with the friend, as the mom insisted on it. Now, the friend is upset, is trying to get others to hate the author, and the author feels they're being blamed. The author is asking if they're the asshole here.\n\nHmm. Let's break this down. The key points are: the author was honest with the friend, but the friend is still upset. The mom initiated the relationship, according to the author. All parties are adults, so legally, there's no issue with the age. But socially and ethically, the question is about whether the author acted inconsiderately or violated some moral boundaries.\n\nOn one hand, the author was honest with the friend, which is good. They didn't hide the relationship. The mom initiated it, so the author might feel they weren't the instigator. But on the other hand, the friend's mom is also the mother of someone the author is friends with, so there's a close relationship between the author and the friend. Even if all parties are adults, the social dynamics here are tricky. The friend is now cutting off the author, which is a valid reaction because of the personal connection. The author might be in a position where they knew the risk of the friend's reaction but still chose to proceed, which could be seen as disregarding the friend's feelings. However, the author didn't know the mom's intentions initially and was honest when approached. Still, the act of sleeping with a friend's parent could be seen as crossing a boundary, even if all parties consented. The author's actions might have caused significant harm to the friend's emotional well-being and their social circle. Even if the author was upfront, the situation is inherently sensitive and can be considered wrong in terms of social norms and respect for the friend's relationship with his mom. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong. But maybe there's a nuance here. The author acted honestly but didn't consider the friend's perspective adequately. The friend is upset and the author didn't stop despite knowing the potential fallout. So, even if the author was truthful, the act itself is problematic. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
