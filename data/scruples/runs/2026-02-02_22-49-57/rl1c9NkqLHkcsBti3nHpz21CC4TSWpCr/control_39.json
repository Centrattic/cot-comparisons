My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question (the author) is in the wrong for having a casual sexual relationship with their friend's mom.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author is 23, the friend is 20, and the mom is 41. The mom was openly flirting, the author asked her out, and they started a casual relationship. The author was upfront with the friend, but the friend is upset and trying to get others to dislike the author. The author is now closer to the mom because of the situation.\n\nNow, considering ethics and social norms. Even though all parties are adults, the relationship involves a close friend's parent, which is a sensitive dynamic. The friend is still living with his mom and might be emotionally attached to her. The author's actions could be seen as exploiting a power dynamic, especially if the mom is in a position of authority or care over her son. Also, the fact that the friend is upset and the social repercussions suggest that the relationship has caused significant harm to their friendship and social circle.\n\nThe author was honest with the friend, which is commendable, but honesty alone doesn't absolve them of the potential wrongness of the action. The situation is complicated by the close relationship between the friend and the mother. Even if all parties are adults, the social and emotional implications are significant. The author's decision to continue the relationship despite the friend's objections and the resulting smear campaign indicates a lack of consideration for the friend's feelings and the potential long-term damage to their social life.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author is in a position where their actions affect others beyond just themselves. The fact that the mom initiated the flirting might reduce the author's culpability, but it doesn't eliminate it entirely. The key issue is the impact on the friend and the social circle. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong because they engaged in a relationship that caused significant harm to their friend's emotional well-being and social standing, regardless of the initial consent and honesty.\n"
