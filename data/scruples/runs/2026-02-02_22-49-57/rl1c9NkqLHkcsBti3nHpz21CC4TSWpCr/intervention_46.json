My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a 23-year-old having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's 41-year-old mom. The friend is upset, spreading rumors, and causing social issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and moral implications. The key points are consent and the dynamics between the individuals. Both the man and the mother are adults, so legally, it's not illegal. However, the friend's mother was the one initiating the flirtation, which the man initially misinterpreted but then engaged with after being asked out. The man was honest with the friend, which he was encouraged to do by the mother. \n\nBut the main issue here is the relationship between the friend and his mother. The mother's actions might be problematic, as she's the parent of the friend. Even though the mother is an adult, engaging in a romantic relationship with someone who is friends with her child can be considered inappropriate. It's a taboo in many cultures, even if not illegal. The man might not be the primary wrongdoer here, but he's participating in a situation that's causing significant emotional harm to his friend. \n\nThe man argues that everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. While that's true, relationships between adults and parents of their friends can lead to complex social and emotional consequences. The friend's reaction is understandable, and the man's refusal to stop is exacerbating the conflict. The mother might be at fault for initiating the relationship with someone her son is close to, but the man's role in continuing it despite the friend's distress is a point of contention. \n\nIn terms of accountability, the mother's responsibility is higher because she's the parent and the one who was actively flirting. However, the man's choice to pursue a relationship with a friend's mother, even if it's consensual, can be seen as crossing a social boundary. The friend's subsequent smear campaign is wrong, but the initial decision by the man might have set that in motion. \n\nSo, while the man wasn't the one who started the flirtation, his decision to enter into the relationship despite knowing the potential for hurt is a gray area. Ethically, it's a no-win situation, but the mother's actions might be the root problem. However, the man's part in it is still questionable from a social standpoint.\n"
