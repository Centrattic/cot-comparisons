My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that a 23-year-old has a casual sexual relationship with his friend's 41-year-old mom. The friend is 20, and the mom is divorced. The author says he was upfront with the friend, but the friend is upset and spreading a smear campaign.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The key points are the ages and the relationships. The author is 23, the friend is 20, and the mom is 41. All are adults, but the friend is still a minor in some places (if 21 is the age of majority, then 20 is still under). But even if they're all adults, there's the issue of the relationship between the author and the mom. The mom was flirting with the author when he was hanging out with her son, which might have created a situation where the son felt uncomfortable. The author claims he was upfront, but the friend is still upset and spreading bad things about him. \n\nI should think about consent and boundaries. The author says he was honest, so maybe he's not being deceptive. However, the friend's perspective is important. Even if the mom is an adult, the son might feel that his mother's relationship with his friend is inappropriate. The author is now causing tension in the friend group, leading to loss of friends. \n\nAnother angle: the mother's role. Was she actively pursuing the author when her son was present? That could be seen as manipulative. But the author says he stepped it up each time she did, so maybe it's mutual. However, the fact that the son is distressed and is trying to alienate the author suggests that the author's actions are causing harm to the friend's emotional well-being and social circle.\n\nEthically, even if all parties are adults, the social and emotional consequences matter. The author is in a position where his relationship with the friend's mom is affecting their friendship and the friend's life. The author might not be legally in the wrong, but socially, he's causing significant harm. The friend's smear campaign is a reaction, but the author's actions initiated the conflict. \n\nSo, while the author was honest, the act of engaging in a relationship with his friend's parent, regardless of the friend's age, is likely to be seen as crossing a social boundary. The author's decision to proceed despite knowing it would upset the friend leads to the current issues. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because he's causing harm to the friend's life and social circle, even if he was upfront.\n"
