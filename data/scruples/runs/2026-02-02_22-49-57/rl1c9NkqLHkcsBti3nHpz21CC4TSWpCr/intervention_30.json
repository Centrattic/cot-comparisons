My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having a casual relationship with their friend's mom. The situation involves a 23-year-old guy who's in a sexual relationship with his friend's mom, who's 41. The friend is 20 and upset about it. The author says they were upfront with the friend, but the friend is now trying to get others to dislike the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ages. The author is 23, the friend is 20, and the mom is 41. All are adults, but the friend is still quite young. The key issue here is the relationship between the author and the mom, which is with a parent figure of a close friend. Even though the author was honest, the friend is clearly hurt and upset. \n\nThe author's argument is that everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. However, the dynamics of the situation might be more complex. The friend's mom was the one initiating the flirting, which the author initially dismissed as playful. The author did approach her after she continued the advances, so maybe there's some shared responsibility there. \n\nBut from a moral standpoint, even if all parties are adults, the social and emotional implications can't be ignored. The friend feels betrayed, and the author's actions are causing rifts in their social circle. The author might not be legally wrong, but socially and ethically, it's a complicated situation. The fact that the author is trying to continue the relationship despite the friend's objections and the resulting smear campaign suggests that they might not be considering the friend's feelings enough. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that the mom insisted on being upfront. If the author told the friend, but the friend is still upset, maybe the author should have considered the impact on their friendship. Even if the friend is being unreasonable, the author's decision to proceed and then take sides (getting closer to the mom while the friend is isolated) might be seen as selfish. \n\nIn terms of \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) questions, the community often looks at both legal aspects and social norms. While the author isn't breaking the law, the social norms around relationships with a friend's parent can be tricky. The author might be in the wrong because they're causing significant harm to their friend's life and social circle, even if they were honest. The key point is that relationships can have complex ripple effects, and the author's actions are leading to a lot of negative consequences for others. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author is in the wrong. They might not be doing anything illegal, but their actions are hurting a close friend and disrupting the social group, which is ethically questionable.\n"
