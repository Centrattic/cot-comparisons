My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person is having a casual sexual relationship with their friend's mom. The friend is 20, and the mom is 41, divorced. The author, who's 23, was approached by the mom who was flirting, and they ended up in a relationship. The friend is upset and is trying to get their mutual friends to hate the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author says they were upfront with the friend. But even if they were honest, the friend is still hurt and upset. The main issue here is that the author is in a relationship with someone who is the mother of their friend. That creates a conflict of loyalty and can really disrupt the social circle. \n\nEven though all parties are adults and can make their own choices, the social dynamics here are important. The friend is 20, which is young, and the author is 23, just a bit older. The mom is 41, so there's a significant age gap between her and the friend. But the problem isn't about the age; it's about the relationship being with the parent of a friend. \n\nIn many cultures, there's a taboo around relationships with someone's parent because it can cause a lot of social tension. The friend is now trying to get others to hate the author, which is a serious consequence. The author might not be legally wrong, but ethically, there's a question. Even if they were honest, the friend's feelings and the social impact matter. \n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong legally or in terms of personal choice, but socially and ethically, their actions have caused harm. The question is whether that makes them in the wrong. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) because they were honest and all parties are adults, but considering the social consequences and the friend's distress, maybe it's A (in the wrong). It's a tough call, but I think the consensus would lean towards the author being in the wrong because of the social disruption and the friend's well-being.\n"
