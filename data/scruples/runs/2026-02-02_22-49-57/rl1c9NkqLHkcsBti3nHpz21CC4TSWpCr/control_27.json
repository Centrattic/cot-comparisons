My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having a casual sexual relationship with their friend's mom. The author is 23, their friend is 20, and the mom is 41. The friend is upset and spreading a smear campaign.\n\nFirst, even though everyone is an adult, the key issue here is the relationship dynamic. The friend is the child of the woman the author is involved with. So, there's a potential conflict of interest between the author and the friend. The friend feels betrayed, which is understandable. Even if the author was upfront, approaching the mother while the son is still in the house might be problematic because it can create tension and hurt feelings. The mother might have boundaries too, but the son's well-being is also a factor here.\n\nThe author might not be legally wrong, but socially and ethically, it's a gray area. The fact that the friend is actively trying to turn others against the author shows the social fallout. Also, the author mentions being closer to the mom because of the situation, which might imply they're taking sides against the friend. This could be seen as dismissive of the friend's feelings. \n\nEven if consent is present, the power dynamic and the existing relationships (parent and child) add complications. The author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the friend's feelings enough and caused a rift in the social circle. So, the answer is A.\n"
