My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a 23-year-old having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom, who is 41. The friend is 20 and upset about it, leading to social issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, the age of consent is around 18, so both the author (23) and the mother (41) are adults. Legally, that's not an issue. But socially and ethically, it's a different story. The mother is the parent of the author's friend, which adds a layer of complexity. Even though the author was upfront with the friend, the act of engaging in a relationship with someone's parent can create tension and discomfort, especially among friends.\n\nThe friend's reaction is understandable. It's a violation of social norms and can make the friend feel betrayed. The author mentions trying to be honest, but the situation itself inherently affects the friend's trust and the group dynamic. The author's decision to continue despite the friend's objections and the subsequent smear campaign might suggest that the author isn't considering the emotional impact on the friend enough.\n\nEven though all parties are adults, relationships often involve more than just legal consent. The power dynamics here are important. The mother is in a parental role in the friend's life, which can make the relationship feel exploitative, especially if there's a significant age difference between the friend and the mother. The author being close to the friend might also mean that the relationship affects their friendship and the friend's well-being.\n\nThe author's belief that they're not in the wrong because they were honest is valid in terms of transparency, but honesty alone doesn't absolve the situation of being ethically questionable. The author's actions have led to the friend's distress and social isolation, which is a negative consequence regardless of intent.\n\nSo, while the author isn't breaking any laws and was honest, the ethical and social implications suggest that the author's actions are problematic. Therefore, the answer would be A, indicating the author is in the wrong.\n"
