My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is a 23-year-old having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom, who is 41 and divorced. The friend is 20 and upset about it, leading to a smear campaign against the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author was upfront with his friend, which is a point in his favor. However, the core issue is that the author is engaging in a relationship with someone's mother, which can be seen as inappropriate regardless of the circumstances. Even though all parties are adults, the power dynamics and the existing relationship between the friend and his mother might make this a sensitive situation. Also, the fact that the friend is still young (20) and living with his mom could add to the family tension. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but I should analyze further. The key points are consent and honesty. The author says he was open with the friend, but does that absolve him? In many cultures, such relationships are considered taboo, not just because of legal or moral reasons but also due to the social implications. The friend's reaction is understandable, even if it's extreme, as it's a betrayal of trust. \n\nThe author might argue that he had no wrong intent and was truthful. However, the consequences are harming the friend's social circle and the friend's mental well-being. Even if the author is being honest, the act itself can be seen as ethically wrong because it disrupts the friend's life and family dynamics. \n\nAlso, the fact that the mom was the one initiating the flirtation might not change the ethical stance, as the author chose to act on it despite knowing the potential fallout. The friend's age is 20, which is close to the author's 23, so the author could be seen as taking advantage of the mother's position in the friend's life. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author was honest, the nature of the relationship is likely to be seen as inappropriate in most social contexts. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
