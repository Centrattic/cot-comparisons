My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having a casual sexual relationship with their friend's mom. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is 23, their friend is 20 and lives with his divorced mom, who is 41. The mom started flirting with the author when they were hanging out at the house. The author thought it was playful at first but then things escalated. The author asked her out, leading to a casual sexual relationship. The author told the friend, but the friend is upset and is now trying to get others to dislike the author. The author feels they're not in the wrong because everyone is an adult and they were honest with the friend.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's consider the factors. The key points here are the ages and the consent. The author is 23, the mom is 41, and the friend is 20. The mom is a divorced adult, and the author is also an adult. Legally, in most places, both parties are adults, so the relationship itself isn't illegal. However, there's a potential issue of the mom being the guardian of the friend, who is still a minor (if he's 20 but depending on the country's age of majority; in many places, 18 is the age of majority, so he's an adult). So the mom is the parent of an adult, so maybe she's still a parent in a societal sense, but legally, she's not a guardian anymore if her son is 20 and an adult.\n\nBut the problem here is not just the legality. The social and ethical aspects are more complex. The author is friends with the son, and the son is upset. The author was upfront with the son, but the son is still upset and is spreading negative things. The author argues that everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. However, there's a potential conflict of interest here. The mother might have a power dynamic with the son, even if he's an adult, because she was his parent. The author might have been aware of the son's feelings and went ahead anyway, which could be seen as crossing a boundary.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author approached the mother after the son was already uncomfortable could be seen as exploiting a relationship. Even if the mother initiated, the author's role in the friendship might be a factor. The son might feel betrayed because the author was close to him before starting the relationship with his mom. The author's argument that everyone is an adult might not account for the social dynamics and the son's emotional state.\n\nAnother angle: the author might be in a position where they're part of the son's social circle, and starting a relationship with his parent could disrupt that circle. The son's reaction, while harsh, might be a response to feeling disrespected or that the author is taking advantage of a vulnerable situation. The mother's insistence on the author being upfront with the son is important because she wanted transparency, but the son's reaction suggests that the author's actions have caused harm beyond just the personal relationship.\n\nIn terms of ethics, even if it's not illegal, it's a matter of social norms and respect. The author might be in the wrong because the relationship could be seen as exploiting a position of familiarity with the son, leading to social consequences that affect not just the individuals but their shared friends. The author's decision to continue the relationship despite the son's objections might be seen as disregarding the son's feelings, even if the author believes in adult autonomy.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong (A) because the situation involves a complex web of relationships where the author's actions, even if consensual, have caused significant harm and may be ethically problematic due to the dynamic with the friend.\n"
