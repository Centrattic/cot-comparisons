My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a 23-year-old who's having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom, who's 41. The friend is 20, so the age difference between the author and the mom is 12 years. The friend is upset and spreading a smear campaign against the author. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author says he was upfront with his friend about the relationship. But even if he was honest, the friend is clearly hurt and angry. The question is whether the author is in the wrong regardless of his honesty.\n\nFrom a social and ethical standpoint, relationships between someone and their partner's parent are generally taboo. It's considered a breach of boundaries because of the existing social and family relationships. Even if all parties are adults, the power dynamics might not be equal. The mom is the parent of the friend, which adds a layer of complexity. The friend is still under 21, so maybe there's a legal aspect depending on the jurisdiction. Some places have laws against such relationships, especially if there's a significant age difference and one person is the parent of the friend.\n\nThe author mentions that the mom was flirting first and initiated the relationship. However, the fact that the friend is part of their social circle complicates things. The author might have thought he was being honest, but the friend's reaction shows that this has caused significant harm. The author's defense is that everyone is an adult, but the friend is still a minor in some contexts (if the age of majority is 18 or 21), which could affect legal responsibilities.\n\nAlso, the author's actions are leading to a breakdown in the social group. The friend is trying to turn others against him, which could be seen as a consequence of the author's actions. Even if the author isn't legally wrong, socially and morally, he's stepping into a situation that's likely to cause pain and conflict. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author is in the wrong because he engaged in a relationship that's socially unacceptable and caused harm to his friend and their shared social circle, regardless of his honesty.\n"
