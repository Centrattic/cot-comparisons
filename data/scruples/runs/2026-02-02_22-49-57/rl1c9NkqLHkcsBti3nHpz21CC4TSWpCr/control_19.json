My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a 23-year-old having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom, who is 41, and the friend, who is 20, is upset and spreading negative things about the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Even though the woman is an adult, the key point is the relationship between the author and his friend. The friend is still a minor in some places, depending on the jurisdiction. In many countries, the age of consent is 16, 18, or higher. Since the friend is 20, maybe he's an adult in some regions, but the mom is his guardian. That could be a problem because there's a power dynamic. The mom might be in a position of authority or trust over the child. \n\nAlso, the author says he was upfront and honest with the friend. But even if so, the friend's reaction is understandable. It's not just about consent but about the appropriateness of the relationship. The mom and the author are both adults, but engaging in a relationship with someone's parent when you're close to the family can cause significant emotional harm. The friend is now actively trying to get others to dislike the author, which is bad, but the author's actions might have been the catalyst for that.\n\nAnother angle: the author mentions that the mom initiated the flirting. But even if she did, the fact that the author is friends with her son adds a layer of complexity. The author might not have considered the impact on the son, even if he's an adult, but the son's well-being is still a concern. It could be seen as crossing a boundary within the social circle, leading to the fallout described.\n\nIn terms of ethics, relationships between someone and a friend's parent can be socially frowned upon, even if legally permissible. The moral judgment here is about respecting the boundaries of the family and the trust within the friendship. The author's decision to continue the relationship despite the friend's distress shows a lack of consideration for the friend's feelings, which is a key point in determining right or wrong.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because the relationship is causing significant harm to the friend and the social group, and it's an ethically questionable situation regardless of legal consent.\n"
