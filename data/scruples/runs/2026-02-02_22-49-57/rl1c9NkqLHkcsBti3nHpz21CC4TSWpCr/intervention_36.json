My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong based on the situation they described. Let me break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author is 23, their friend is 20, and their friend's mom is 41. The mom was openly flirting with the author when they were at the friend's house. The author thought it was playful at first, but it escalated. The author asked her out, and they've been in a casual sexual relationship for about a month and a half. The author told the friend because the mom insisted on it, and they didn't want to hurt the friend. Now the friend is upset, trying to get others to hate the author, and the author feels closer to the mom because of losing friends.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLet me consider the factors here. Legally, all parties are adults, so there's no legal issue. But morally and socially, this is a complex situation. The friend is 20, so not an adult in many places, but the mom is an adult. However, the mom is the parent of the author's friend, which creates a power dynamic. The author was upfront with the friend, which is good, but the friend is still hurt. The mom initiated the relationship, or at least escalated the flirtation when alone with the author. \n\nThe author's actions might be seen as crossing a boundary, even if they were honest. The friend's perspective is important here. Even though adults can make their own choices, the relationship involves someone related by marriage (the mom is divorced, but still the mother of the friend). There's also the aspect of the author being in a position where they might have had influence or friendship with the friend, which could affect how others perceive the relationship.\n\nHowever, the author didn't force the situation; they were asked out by the mom after the flirtation. The author was honest with the friend, which is commendable. The friend's reaction is understandable, but the author isn't obligated to stop the relationship unless they caused harm intentionally. The mom is an adult, so she has autonomy over her actions. \n\nBut there's a social taboo around relationships between someone and their partner's former partner or in-laws. Even if there's no legal issue, the social ramifications are significant, as seen in the friend's smear campaign. The author might be in a morally ambiguous position because they're involved with the mother of their friend, which can be seen as exploiting a vulnerable position or taking advantage of a situation where the friend is upset.\n\nOn the other hand, if the mom initiated the relationship and the author was transparent with the friend, then perhaps the author isn't entirely at fault. But the fact that the author continued the relationship despite knowing it would hurt the friend might make them complicit in the friend's distress. The key points are consent, honesty, and the impact on the friend. Since the author was honest, but the relationship is causing harm to the friend, there's a conflict between the adults' choices and the effect on the friend's well-being.\n\nI think the answer depends on whether the author's actions were manipulative or if they simply followed the mom's lead. If the mom was the one initiating and encouraging the relationship, the author might have less culpability. However, the author's decision to continue despite the friend's clear distress could be seen as inconsiderate. But since the author was honest and the mom is an adult, the author might not be in the wrong. \n\nHmm, this is tricky. The main issue is the social and emotional impact on the friend, but legally and in terms of autonomy, the author isn't violating any rules. The friend's reaction is extreme, but the author isn't necessarily wrong. However, the fact that the author is now closer to the mom while the friend is being alienated could be seen as taking advantage. But the author might just be trying to maintain their own happiness despite the fallout. \n\nIn conclusion, while there are valid arguments on both sides, the author might not be in the wrong because they were honest, the mom initiated, and all parties are adults. However, the social consequences are significant, but that doesn't necessarily make the author at fault. So, I think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
