My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a 23-year-old having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's 41-year-old mom. The friend is upset and spreading a smear campaign against him. The question is if the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author was asked by the friend's mom to be upfront with the friend, which he did. All parties are adults, so legally there's no issue here. However, socially and ethically, it's a different matter. \n\nThe main ethical concern here is the relationship between the author and the friend's mom. Even though they're adults, the fact that the friend is still living with his mom and the author is his friend complicates things. The friend might feel betrayed, which is understandable. The author might argue that he was honest, but honesty doesn't always mitigate the harm caused. \n\nThe author's actions have caused significant distress in their social circle. The friend is trying to turn everyone against him, which is a problem, but the root cause is the author's decision to pursue the relationship. Even if the author is in a consensual relationship, the dynamics of being friends with someone whose parent you're involved with can be problematic. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that the mother was the one initiating the flirtation, but that doesn't absolve him of responsibility. He made the choice to act on it and continue the relationship despite knowing his friend's feelings. The fact that the friend is upset and the social consequences suggest that the author's actions have crossed a social boundary, even if not a legal one.\n\nIn many cultures, relationships with someone's parent, especially when they're close in age to the friend, are considered taboo. The author might not be legally wrong, but socially, he's in a difficult position. The friend's reaction is extreme, but the author's decision to proceed with the relationship likely caused the initial rift. \n\nTherefore, considering the social implications and the harm caused to the friend, the author is in the wrong even if they were honest.\n"
