My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me go through the details again.\n\nThe situation is that the author, who is 23, has a casual sexual relationship with their friend's mom. The friend is 20, and his mom is 41. The mom was divorced two years ago, and she's been flirting with the author. The author says he asked her out and they've been in a casual relationship for a month and a half. He was upfront with his friend, who is now upset and trying to get others to turn against him. The author is wondering if he's at fault.\n\nHmm. First, let's consider the age aspect. The author is 23, the friend is 20, and the mom is 41. So the author is only three years older than the friend. The mom is significantly older, but the main issue here is the relationship between the author and the mom, which the friend is upset about.\n\nNow, the author claims he was honest with his friend. He says the mom was the one who was flirting, and he stepped it up each time. So the author isn't saying he just took advantage; he's implying mutual interest. But even if both were adults, the friend's reaction is a big part of the problem.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a legal standpoint, if everyone is of legal age, there's no crime. The mom is 41, so she's an adult. The author is also an adult. So legally, there's no issue. But socially, it's a different matter. The friend is 20, which is still young, and the fact that the author is his friend adds a layer of betrayal.\n\nThe author might argue that since he was honest, he's not at fault. But the friend feels betrayed, and the author is causing social issues by continuing the relationship despite the friend's objections. The author is prioritizing his own desires over the friend's feelings and the potential damage to their friendship and social circle.\n\nAlso, there's the aspect of the mother being in a position of some authority or at least a parental role in the friend's life. Even though she's divorced, she's still his mom. The author's relationship with her could be seen as crossing a boundary that's not just about age but about the existing family dynamic.\n\nBut the author is being upfront, which is a point in his favor. However, the impact on the friend's life and the social circle is significant. The friend is trying to get others to hate him, which is problematic, but the author's actions might have justified that reaction.\n\nIn some cultures or social circles, such a relationship might be taboo even if it's consensual. The author might not be legally wrong, but socially, he's causing harm. The key point is whether the relationship is affecting others in a negative way, which it clearly is, leading to the friend's smear campaign.\n\nSo, even if the author is honest and the relationship is consensual, he's in a position where his actions are causing real harm to a friend and disrupting their social group. That might make him at fault, not just for the relationship itself but for how it's affecting others. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
