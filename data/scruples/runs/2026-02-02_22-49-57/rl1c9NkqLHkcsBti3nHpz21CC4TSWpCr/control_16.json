My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having a casual sexual relationship with their friend's mom. The situation is that the friend is 20, the mom is 41, and they're divorced. The author is 23.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ages. The friend is 20, which is an adult, but maybe there's a dynamic where the author and the friend have a close relationship. The mom initiated flirting, and the author started dating her after being asked out. The author says they were upfront with the friend, but the friend is upset and spreading a smear campaign.\n\nLegally, all parties are adults, so there's no legal issue. But socially, there's a lot of complexity. The friend might feel betrayed even if the author was honest. The author's reasoning is that everyone is an adult and can make their own choices, but the friend's emotional reaction is valid. \n\nEthically, even if the author was honest, the situation is fraught. The friend's mom being the ex-stepdad's wife might add another layer. The author's actions could be seen as taking advantage of the friend's trust or the family situation. Also, the fact that the friend is still living with his mom might affect the dynamics. \n\nThe author's refusal to stop despite the friend's request could be seen as dismissive of the friend's feelings. Even if the author is being honest, the consequences are hurting the friend. The author's argument that adults can make their own choices is valid, but the relationship between the author and the friend complicates it. The friend's age (20) is close to the author's (23), so maybe they're friends in a way that the author's actions affect their entire social circle. \n\nThe key points here are consent, honesty, and the impact on others. The author was honest initially, but the friend is still upset. The author's decision to continue the relationship despite the friend's anger might be seen as not respecting the friend's emotional state. Even if the author isn't legally wrong, socially they might be considered in the wrong because of the harm caused to the friend and their social circle. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because the situation has caused significant harm to the friend, and continuing the relationship despite the friend's explicit request to stop could be seen as unethical, even if the actions themselves are consensual between adults.\n"
