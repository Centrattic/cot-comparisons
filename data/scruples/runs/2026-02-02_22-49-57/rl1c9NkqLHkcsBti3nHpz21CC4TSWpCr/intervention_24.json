My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. So, the person is asking if they're in the wrong for having a casual sexual relationship with their friend's mom. The friend is 20, the mom is 41, and the person is 23. The friend is upset and spreading a smear campaign, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, in most places, consensual adult relationships are allowed. All parties are adults, so there's no legal issue here. But ethically, it's more complicated. The friend is 20, which is young, and the mom is his parent. Even if the friend is an adult, the dynamic of a parent-child relationship might still be a problem when it comes to relationships with friends. \n\nThe author was upfront with the friend, which is good. Honesty is a big factor here. But the friend is still upset and is trying to turn others against the author. The author's argument is that everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. However, the mother is in a position of authority as a parent, which can create a power imbalance. Even if the mother initiated the relationship, the fact that she's a parent might make it ethically questionable.\n\nAlso, consider the social implications. The friend's reaction is understandable because it's a sensitive situation. The author is now facing social consequences, but was it their fault? The key points are consent, honesty, and the power dynamic. If the mother is making her own decisions and the author is honest, maybe they're not in the wrong. However, the mother's role as a parent could mean she's in a position where she's supposed to be a guardian, not a romantic partner. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the friend's well-being. The friend might feel betrayed or manipulated, even if the author was honest. The author might not be malicious, but the relationship could still be seen as inappropriate due to the existing parent-child relationship. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the power dynamic invalidates the relationship's appropriateness, even with consent and honesty. Some might argue that the mother shouldn't be in a relationship with her child's friend because of the potential for influence or manipulation. Others might say that as long as it's consensual and honest, it's up to the adults involved. \n\nGiven that the author was upfront and the mother is an adult making her own choices, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. However, the situation is complex, and there's a lot of gray area. The key is that the author didn't force the relationship and was honest, but the mother's role as a parent complicates things. So, it's a tough call, but leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they were honest and it's a consensual adult relationship. But others might disagree based on the parent-child dynamic.\n"
