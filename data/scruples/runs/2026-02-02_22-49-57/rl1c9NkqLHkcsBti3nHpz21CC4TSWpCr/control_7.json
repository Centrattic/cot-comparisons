My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong (A or B) in the given scenario. The situation involves a 23-year-old having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom, which is causing conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The author is 23, the friend is 20, and his mom is 41. The mom was flirting, the author asked her out, they had a casual relationship. The author told the friend, but the friend is upset and spreading a smear campaign. The author is now closer to the mom because he's losing friends.\n\nNow, the key points here. Legally, all parties are adults, so there's no underage issue. But ethically and socially, it's a different matter. The main issue is the relationship with the friend's mother. Even if the author was upfront, the friend's mom being married to the friend's dad until two years ago might not be relevant if they're divorced. But the fact that it's the friend's mom could still be a problem because of the existing family dynamic and the potential for hurt feelings.\n\nThe author did inform the friend, which is good, but the friend is still upset. The problem is that the relationship could be seen as crossing a boundary, especially since the friend is still part of the mother's life. Even if all parties are adults, the social implications are significant. The author is causing distress in the friend's life, which might affect their entire circle of friends. The fact that the friend is trying to get others to hate the author shows how disruptive it is.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is arguing that everyone is an adult and should be free to make their own choices. But in social contexts, relationships with someone's parent can be sensitive. The mother's age (41) and the friend's age (20) also play into the power dynamic. The mother might be in a position where she's still a parent figure to the friend, so the relationship could be seen as exploiting that dynamic.\n\nAnother angle: the author might have a genuine emotional connection with the mother now, but the main issue is the impact on the friend and the social circle. The author's decision to continue the relationship despite the friend's objections and the resulting fallout might make them responsible for the social damage, even if they're not legally at fault.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the answer hinges on ethics and social norms rather than legality. The author's actions are causing significant harm to their friendship and social group. Even though they were honest, the relationship is inherently problematic given the family ties. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong from a social standpoint, making the answer A.\n"
