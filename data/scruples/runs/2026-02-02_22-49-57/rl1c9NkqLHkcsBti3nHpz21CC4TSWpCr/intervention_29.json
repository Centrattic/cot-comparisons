My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a 23-year-old who's having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom, who's 41. The friend is 20 and is upset about it. The author claims to have been upfront with the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ages and the dynamics. The author is 23, the friend is 20, and the mother is 41. All are adults. Legally, they can make their own choices, but there's a social and emotional component here. The mother initiated the flirting, and the author took it further after the friend was informed. The friend is now upset and trying to turn others against the author.\n\nThe key points here are consent and honesty. The author was upfront with the friend, which is important. However, the relationship is with someone who is a parent to the author's friend. That creates a complex dynamic, potentially involving power imbalances or emotional manipulation, especially if the mother is using her position as a parent to influence the relationship. Also, the friend's reaction suggests that the relationship is causing significant social issues for the author, leading to isolation.\n\nBut from a legal standpoint, there's no issue here. All parties are adults, and there's no coercion mentioned. The author might not be in the wrong legally, but socially, it's a controversial situation. The main issue is the impact on the friend. Even if the author was honest, the relationship could be seen as exploiting a vulnerable position, especially if the mother's actions were manipulative to get the author to side against her ex-husband or to take advantage of her son's trust.\n\nHowever, the author was honest, which is a positive point. The question is whether being honest absolves them of wrongdoing. If the mother is equally complicit and the friend is still upset despite the honesty, it's a matter of social judgment. The author might not be in the wrong from a legal perspective but could be seen as inconsiderate of the friend's feelings and the social dynamics.\n\nAnother angle is the potential for the mother to be using the relationship to undermine her ex-husband, which could be a manipulation tactic. If the mother is divorced and the author is her son's friend, there's a possible conflict of interest where the mother might be leveraging her role as a parent to form an alliance against the ex-husband. That could be problematic, even if not illegal.\n\nIn summary, while the author wasn't illegal in their actions and was honest, the social and emotional impact on the friend and the potential for manipulation by the mother might place some responsibility on the author. However, without coercion or deceit, it's debatable. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) but with caveats about the social consequences and ethical considerations.\n"
