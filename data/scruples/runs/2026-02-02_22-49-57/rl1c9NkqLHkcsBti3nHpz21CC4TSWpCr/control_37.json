My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who started the relationship is in the wrong. So, the situation is that a 23-year-old is having a casual sexual relationship with his 20-year-old friend's 41-year-old mom. The friend is upset and trying to get others to dislike the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ages and consent. The friend is 20, the author is 23, and the mom is 41. All are adults, so legally, they can make their own decisions. But there's a dynamic here where the mom is the parent of the friend, which might complicate things socially and emotionally.\n\nThe author says they were upfront with the friend. Honesty is important, but does that mitigate the wrongness? The friend is clearly hurt and upset, so even if the author was honest, the act of pursuing a relationship with someone's parent could be seen as crossing a boundary. Social norms often frown upon such relationships because they can damage friendships and family dynamics.\n\nThen there's the aspect of the mom's role. If she's the parent of the friend, maintaining a relationship with the author might create tension. The author mentions the mom initiated flirting, but that doesn't necessarily absolve them of responsibility. Both parties are adults, but the power dynamic and the potential for emotional harm to the friend should be considered.\n\nThe author is also facing social consequences, like being ostracized by friends. However, that doesn't mean they're right. The key here is whether the author respected the friend's feelings and boundaries. Even if the author was honest, the relationship might still be seen as violating a social boundary, making them at fault.\n\nSo, considering all angles\u2014legal consent, honesty, social norms, and the impact on the friend\u2014it seems like the author is in the wrong because they pursued a relationship that caused significant distress to a close friend, despite being aware of the potential issues.\n"
