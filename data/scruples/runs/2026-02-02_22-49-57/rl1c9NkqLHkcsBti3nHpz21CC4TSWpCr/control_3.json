My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a 23-year-old who's having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mother. The friend, who's 20, is upset and spreading negative things about the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author mentions that the friend's mom was initially flirting, and they ended up in a casual relationship. The author was upfront with the friend. Now, the friend is trying to get their mutual friends to dislike the author.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author is in the wrong despite being honest. Let's break it down. \n\nLegally, if everyone is an adult, there's no legal issue. But socially and ethically, it's a different story. The mother is the parent of the author's friend, which makes the situation complex. Even if the author was honest, the act of pursuing a romantic/sexual relationship with someone's parent can be seen as crossing a boundary. \n\nThe friend's reaction is understandable. It's a breach of trust and could be seen as disrespectful towards the friend. The friend might feel that the author betrayed their trust, even if the author was upfront. Also, the mother being the ex-wife of the friend's father adds another layer. The mother might be in a vulnerable situation post-divorce, and the author could be taking advantage of that.\n\nMoreover, the author mentions that the relationship has caused the friend to start a smear campaign. While the friend's reaction is harsh, the author's actions might have initiated the conflict. The question is whether the author's actions were ethically wrong regardless of their honesty.\n\nI need to consider cultural and social norms. In many societies, relationships between someone's parent and their friend are frowned upon due to the existing family dynamics. Even with consent, it's often considered taboo. The author might not be legally wrong, but socially, they could be seen as in the wrong because they've disrupted the friend's family and trust.\n\nAnother angle is the power dynamic. The mother is in a position of authority over the son in terms of household, even if the son is an adult. The author could be seen as taking advantage of that dynamic. Also, the fact that the relationship started with the mother initiating the flirting complicates things, but the author still chose to pursue it despite knowing the potential fallout.\n\nThe author claims that everyone is an adult and should make their own choices, but relationships can have ripple effects beyond just the individuals involved. The friend's distress is a significant consequence here. The author's decision to continue despite the friend's explicit request to stop might be seen as dismissive of the friend's feelings, even if the author is within their rights to make that choice.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author was honest, the core issue is whether pursuing a relationship with a friend's parent, despite being upfront, is ethically wrong. Considering the breach of trust, the impact on the friend, and societal norms, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong. So, the answer is A.\n"
