My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a 23-year-old having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom, who's 41. The friend is 20, and the mom is divorced.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author claims they were open with the friend, but the friend is upset and trying to get others to dislike the author. The key points are consent and the impact on relationships. Both the author and the mom are adults, so legally they can consent. But socially, there's a taboo about relationships involving friends' parents. The friend is 20, which is still pretty close in age to the author. The mom was initiating the flirting, and the author says they were upfront with the friend.\n\nBut wait, even though they're adults, the social implications are huge. The friend's trust is broken, and the author is now causing tension in their social circle. The author might be right in thinking it's their choice, but relationships like this often have power dynamics or emotional complexities that aren't immediately obvious. The fact that the mom is the parent of the author's friend adds another layer. Even if the author was honest, the friend's reaction is valid because it's a sensitive situation. The author might be justifying their actions, but they could be overlooking the emotional impact on the friend. So, even if it's consensual, the author's actions are causing harm to their friend and social group. That might make the author at fault socially, even if legally they're not. So the answer might be A, they are in the wrong.\n"
