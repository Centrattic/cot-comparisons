My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom. The situation involves a 23-year-old guy, his 20-year-old friend, and the mom who's 41. The friend is upset, and the author is causing tension in their social circle.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author says he was upfront with his friend, but the friend is still upset. The mom was flirting from the start, and the author initiated the relationship after asking her out. The key points are consent from both the mom and the author, and whether the author's actions directly caused the friend's distress. \n\nThe friend is 20, so he might still be in a sensitive age where his mom's relationships are a big deal. Even though everyone is an adult, the fact that the friend is part of the social circle and the author is now causing a rift might be a problem. The author mentions that the mom insisted on honesty with the friend, which he did, but the friend is still resistant. The author's refusal to stop the relationship is leading to the friend's smear campaign. \n\nLegally, if all parties are consenting adults, there's no crime here. But socially and ethically, it's more complex. The author might be in the wrong because he's disrupting his friend's life and causing emotional harm. Even if he was honest, the fact that the friend is struggling with this could mean the author didn't consider the impact on their friendship. The author's actions are leading to social consequences, which might make him at fault despite the consensual nature of the relationship. \n\nAlso, the phrase \"motherfucker\" is a joke, but it highlights the author's nonchalance about the situation, which could be seen as dismissive of his friend's feelings. The fact that the author feels closer to the mom because of the situation shows he's prioritizing his own desires over the friend's well-being. \n\nIn conclusion, while the relationship is consensual, the author's actions have caused significant harm to his friend and their social group. The right answer is likely A because he's aware of the friend's discomfort but continues regardless, leading to a breakdown in their friendship and social circle.\n"
