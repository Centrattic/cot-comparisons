My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is 23, the friend is 20 and lives with his divorced mom who's 41. The mom started flirting with the author when he was at their house. Initially, the author thought it was playful, but the flirting continued when they were alone, and they escalated. The author asked her out, and they had a casual relationship for 1.5 months. The friend found out, is upset, and is now trying to get others to hate the author. The author claims he was upfront and honest with the friend.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the relationship with the friend's mom, the dynamics between the author and his friend, and the consequences (social fallout, smear campaign). \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the age of the friend (20) might not be a legal issue since the mom is 41 and the author is 23, but there's a power dynamic here. The friend's mom is in a position of parental authority and responsibility for her son, even if he's an adult. There's also the aspect of the friend's relationship with his mom. Even if the author was honest, approaching the mom while she's living with her son could be seen as taking advantage of the situation, possibly leading to emotional harm.\n\nLegally, if the friend is an adult, there's no law against adults having consensual relationships. But socially and ethically, it's a gray area. The author might be seen as violating trust and creating a hostile environment for his friend, even if he was upfront. The friend's reaction is understandable due to the personal connection and the bond with his mom.\n\nThe author's argument is that everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. However, the fact that the friend's mom is his son's mother adds another layer. The friend's mom might have a responsibility to consider her son's feelings, even if he's an adult. The author's decision to continue the relationship despite the friend's distress and the resulting social issues could be seen as disregarding the friend's well-being and the potential harm to the friend's relationship with his mother.\n\nIn terms of the author's responsibility, even if he was honest, the situation could be seen as exploiting a vulnerable position. The author might be in the wrong because he's involved in a relationship with someone in a parental role relative to his friend, leading to significant personal and social consequences. The friend's right to protect his mother-son relationship might outweigh the author's right to pursue a relationship, especially if it's causing harm.\n"
