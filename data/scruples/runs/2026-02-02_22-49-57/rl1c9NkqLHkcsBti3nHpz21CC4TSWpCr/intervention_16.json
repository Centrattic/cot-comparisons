My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a 23-year-old having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's 41-year-old mother, which has caused tension with the friend and his social circle.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is an adult, as is the friend's mother. They are both adults, so legally, consensual relationships between adults are generally allowed. The friend is 20, which is also an adult, but maybe still in a position where the relationship could be seen as crossing boundaries. The mother initiated flirting, and the author was upfront with the friend. The friend is upset, spreading a smear campaign, and the author feels the friend is overreacting because everyone is an adult.\n\nNow, thinking about social norms and ethical considerations. Even if legally it's allowed, socially, there's a lot of stigma around relationships with in-laws or close friends' parents. The mother was the one initiating, but the author took the step to ask her out. The fact that the author was open with the friend might not absolve them of the social repercussions. The friend's reaction is understandable because it's their parent, and it can feel like a betrayal.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether the relationship is ethically wrong beyond legality. Even if everyone is an adult, the dynamics of the relationship\u2014given the existing friendship and the parent's role in the friend's life\u2014might make it morally questionable. The author's argument is that adults can make their own choices, but the friend's emotional response and the resulting social fallout suggest there's more to consider.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author was honest with the friend, which is a positive point. However, the relationship's impact on the friend's life and the disruption of their social group could be seen as the author's fault, even if they thought they were being upfront. The fact that the author is now closer to the mother and the friend is alienated might indicate a lack of consideration for the friend's feelings.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, even if the author isn't legally wrong, they might still be socially or ethically in the wrong. The answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the relationship is causing significant harm to the friend despite the author's honesty, and social norms often frown upon such relationships regardless of consent.\n"
