My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a 23-year-old having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom, which is causing conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The friend is 20, so his mom is his legal guardian. Even though the mom is an adult, the relationship involves a family member of a close friend. The key here is whether the author acted inconsiderately towards the friend's feelings. The author did tell the friend, as the mom insisted, but the friend is hurt and upset. The author's argument is that everyone's an adult, but relationships with family members can be sensitive.\n\nNext, social dynamics: The friend is trying to get others to hate the author. That's a negative reaction, but the author's actions might have crossed a social boundary. The author is now closer to the mom because of losing friends, which shows the situation is complicated.\n\nLegally, there's no issue since all parties are adults. But morally, the author might be in the wrong because the friend's feelings were disregarded, even if the author was honest. The mom's actions initiated the flirting, but the author chose to pursue a relationship despite knowing the friend's potential reaction.\n\nThe question is whether honesty and consent make it okay. However, the main issue is the breach of trust and the impact on the friend. Even if the author had good intentions, the relationship could be seen as exploiting a vulnerable position or causing unnecessary harm to a friend. So, the author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider the emotional impact on their friend enough.\n"
