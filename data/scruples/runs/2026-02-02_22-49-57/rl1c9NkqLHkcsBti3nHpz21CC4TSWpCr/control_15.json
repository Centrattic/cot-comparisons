My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having a casual sexual relationship with their friend's mom. So, first, I need to consider the key points here.\n\nThe author is 23, their friend is 20, and the mom is 41. The friend lives with his divorced mom. The mom was openly flirting, and the author thought it was playful at first. But then the flirting continued when they were alone, and both escalated things. The author asked her out, and they've been in a casual relationship for a month and a half. They were upfront with the friend, but the friend is upset, telling the author to stop. Now the friend is trying to get others to hate the author, leading to social issues. The author feels they're being targeted and is now closer to the mom because of it. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, legally, there's nothing illegal here. The mom is an adult, and the author is an adult. However, the situation is ethically and socially complicated. The main issue is the friend's distress. The author claims they were honest with the friend, but the friend might still feel betrayed. Even if they're adults, crossing boundaries in a social circle can cause harm. The mom's role here is also important. If she initiated the relationship, does that change things? The author might feel it's her choice, but the friend is part of the equation since he lives with his mom and likely has a close relationship with her.\n\nThe friend's reaction is understandable. It's a violation of trust. The author didn't ask the friend's permission, and even though the friend is an adult, the social dynamics are tricky. The author might argue that they were honest, but honesty doesn't erase the hurt caused. The friend's smear campaign is extreme, but the author's actions led to that. The question is whether the author overstepped by pursuing a relationship with someone who is part of their friend's immediate family. Social norms usually consider such relationships taboo, even if legally permissible. The author's actions could be seen as taking advantage of their friend's trust or being in a position where the power dynamics are skewed, especially if the friend depends on his mom. The author might be in the wrong because they disregarded their friend's feelings and potentially disrupted the family's dynamics, even if the mom was the one who initiated. Also, the casual nature of the relationship might not provide enough consideration for the friend's emotional state. The answer likely leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because of the social and emotional impact on the friend, despite the legal and adult consent aspects.\n"
