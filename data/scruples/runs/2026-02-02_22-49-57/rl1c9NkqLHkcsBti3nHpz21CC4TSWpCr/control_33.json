Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is 23, their friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom who's 41. The mom started flirting with the author when they visited the friend's house. The author thought she was just being playful but the mom kept up the flirting when they were alone. The author asked her out, and they've been in a casual sexual relationship for a month and a half. The friend found out and is upset, telling the author to stop. The author didn't stop, and now the friend is trying to get others to dislike them, which has caused the author to lose friends but feel closer to the mom.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, let's consider the relationships involved. The author is in a relationship with the mother of their friend. The friend is 20, which is of legal age in most places, but the mom is 41 and presumably the legal guardian. The author is 23. All are adults, but there's a social hierarchy here. The friend's mom is the parent of the person who is close to the author. Even if the mom initiated the relationship, the fact that she is the mother of the author's friend complicates things.\n\nEthically, even if all parties are adults and consent is given, the social implications might matter. The friend is likely to feel deeply betrayed, especially since the author was upfront with him. However, the author might argue that they had no intention of harming the friend but the situation spiraled out of control. The key points here are consent, the dynamics between the individuals, and the impact on the social circle.\n\nThe author did tell the friend, which is a point in their favor. However, the fact that the friend is now trying to get others to hate the author suggests that the situation is causing rifts. The author's decision to continue the relationship despite the friend's objections could be seen as causing further harm, even if they were honest.\n\nLegally, in many places, a consensual relationship between two adults is legal. But socially, there's a taboo against relationships between adults and the parents of their close friends. The mother's role as a parent in the friend's life might mean that the author is overstepping boundaries, especially if the friend is still under parental care, even if he's an adult.\n\nThe author mentions that they are now closer to the mother because they're losing friends, which adds a layer of emotional dependency. The mother's initial flirting could be a factor, but the author's decision to pursue the relationship might be seen as taking advantage of a vulnerable position, especially if the mother is in a position of influence over the friend.\n\nIn terms of ethics, even if the relationship is consensual, the author is creating a rift in their friend's social circle and causing emotional distress. The friend's reaction is understandable, and the author's refusal to stop despite the friend's wishes might be seen as disrespectful to the friend's feelings and the existing relationship dynamics.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, even though the author was honest, the act of engaging in a relationship with their friend's mother is likely to be seen as socially and ethically wrong, leading to the author being in the wrong. The answer would be A.\n"
