My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, who's 23, is in a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom, who's 41. His friend is 20 and is upset about it. The author says he told his friend upfront and that the mother was flirting first.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend's mom is divorced and lives with her son. The author was friends with the son before the relationship started. Even though the author was upfront, the son is clearly hurt and upset, leading to social issues. \n\nLegally, all parties are adults, so there's no underage issue. But ethically and socially, there's a lot to unpack. The mother living in the same house as her son complicates things. Even if the author was honest, the relationship could create a conflict of interest and emotional distress for the son. \n\nThe key points are: boundaries between friends and family, the potential for exploitation, and the impact on the friend. The son is 20, still young and close to his mom. The mother's actions might be inappropriate if she's in a position of care or authority over her son. Also, the author's decision to continue despite the friend's objections and the resulting smear campaign shows a lack of consideration for the friend's feelings, even if the author doesn't see it as his fault.\n\nSo, even though the author was honest, the situation involves a power dynamic and emotional entanglement that's problematic. The answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) because the relationship is causing significant harm to the friend and disrupting their social circle, regardless of the adults' choices.\n"
