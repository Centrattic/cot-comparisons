My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the person is 23, their friend is 20 and lives with his divorced mom, who's 41. The mom was flirting, and they ended up in a casual sexual relationship. The friend is upset, spreading a smear campaign against the author. The author is now closer to the mom because they feel isolated.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. The author says they were upfront with the friend. But the question is whether that makes it okay. Even if they were honest, sleeping with someone's parent can be really problematic. It's a power dynamic because the mom is in a parental role, even if she's not the author's parent. The friend is 20, so still pretty young, and the mom is a parent figure in his life. The author might have crossed a boundary, even if all parties are adults. The fact that the mom was flirting and escalated things suggests she had some interest, but the friend is clearly hurt. \n\nThe author's argument is that adults can make their own choices, but the problem here is the relationship's nature. It's between someone who's in a social circle with the son and his mother, which can create a lot of tension. The friend is being affected, and the author is continuing the relationship despite the friend's demand to stop. They're also gaining closer to the mom because of the isolation from friends. \n\nLegally, if all parties are consenting adults, it's not illegal. But socially and ethically, it's a big issue. The mother is in a position that could be seen as taking advantage of the son's friendship with the author. Even if the author was upfront, the act of being with someone's parent can be seen as violating a trust or boundary, especially if the son feels betrayed. \n\nThe friend's reaction is understandable, even if it's extreme. The author's refusal to stop might be seen as prioritizing their own desires over the friend's feelings, leading to the social circle turning against them. The fact that the author is now closer to the mom because of the situation might indicate they're seeking validation, but that could also be part of the problem. \n\nSo, even if the author was honest, the act itself is problematic. It's a messy situation where personal boundaries and the impact on others are key factors. The author might not be the only one at fault, but they definitely contributed to the problem by entering the relationship, which could be seen as the wrong choice.\n"
