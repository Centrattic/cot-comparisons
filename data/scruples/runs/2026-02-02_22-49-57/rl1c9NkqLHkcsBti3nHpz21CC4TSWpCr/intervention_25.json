My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who started a casual relationship with their friend's mom is in the wrong. The situation involves a 23-year-old, a 20-year-old friend, and his 41-year-old mom. The friend's mom was openly flirting, and they ended up having a casual sexual relationship after the author asked her out. The friend is upset and spreading a smear campaign.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author is in the wrong. Legally, all parties are adults, so there's no age of consent issue here. But socially, there's a lot to unpack. The author did tell the friend, which is important because transparency is key here. The friend is hurt, which makes sense because it's a close relationship. The friend's mom initiated the flirting, which the author initially thought was playful but escalated. The author's argument is that everyone's an adult and can make their own choices, which has some merit, but relationships with someone's parent can be complicated, especially if it affects their child's well-being.\n\nThe friend's reaction is understandable. It's a betrayal of trust, even if the author was honest. The author's decision to continue the relationship despite the friend's anger could be seen as prioritizing their own desires over the friend's feelings. The fact that the friend is trying to get others to hate the author might be an overreaction, but the author's actions did cause significant harm to their friendship.\n\nSo, while the author might not be legally wrong, socially and ethically, there's a case that they acted inconsiderately. The key points are the impact on the friend, the dynamics of the relationship, and whether the author considered how their actions would affect others beyond just their own choices. The answer might depend on cultural norms and personal ethics, but given the context, the author's actions could be seen as wrong because they disrupted the friend's life and caused lasting damage to relationships, even if they were upfront.\n"
