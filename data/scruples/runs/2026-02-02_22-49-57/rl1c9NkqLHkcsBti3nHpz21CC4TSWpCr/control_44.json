My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a 23-year-old having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's 41-year-old mother. The friend is 20, and he's upset, leading to social issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. The age of consent varies by location, but generally, in most places, 18 is the age of majority. The mother is 41, so the age difference is significant, but both the author and the mother are adults. However, there's a power dynamic here\u2014the mother is a parent figure in the friend's life, which could complicate things.\n\nThe author claims to have been upfront with the friend. Honesty is important, but even if they were honest, the friend might still feel betrayed. The friend is 20, so maybe he's not fully independent yet, living with his mom. The mother's role as a parent and her decision to engage in a relationship with someone close to her child adds another layer. Even if the mother is an adult, her actions could affect her child's well-being and trust.\n\nSocially, this is a sensitive situation. The friend is upset and trying to distance the author from their mutual friends. The author mentions that they've been running out of friends, which is a consequence of the situation. The question is whether the author's actions were wrong despite being honest.\n\nEthically, relationships between someone and a parent of their friend can be problematic. Even if all parties are adults, the dynamic involves someone in a parental role, which can create power imbalances and emotional complications. The mother's initial flirting and the author's pursuit of the relationship might be seen as taking advantage of a position of trust or familiarity.\n\nLegally, unless there are specific laws against this in their jurisdiction (like laws against relationships with someone's parent if there's a close age to the child, which is rare), it might not be illegal. But socially and ethically, it's a gray area. The friend's emotional distress and the author's decision to continue despite the friend's objections could be seen as selfish or inconsiderate, even if they were honest.\n\nThe author's argument is that everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. However, the impact on the friend and the social circle is significant. The author's actions have caused a rift, and the friend is retaliating by spreading negative things about the author. This could affect the author's friendships and social life, but it's a consequence of their decision.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might not be breaking any laws, the ethical and social implications are strong. The relationship is causing harm to the friend and disrupting the social group. Even with honesty, the situation is messy and likely to have negative repercussions. So, the author is probably in the wrong because of the harm caused to the friend and the social dynamics involved.\n"
