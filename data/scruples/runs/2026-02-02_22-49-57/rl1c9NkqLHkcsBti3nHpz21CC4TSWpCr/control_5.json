My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having a relationship with their friend's mom. The scenario is pretty straightforward but involves some ethical and social considerations.\n\nFirst, the author is 23, their friend is 20, and the friend's mom is 41. The mom started flirting, and they ended up in a casual sexual relationship. The author was upfront with the friend. The friend is upset, trying to get friends to dislike the author. The question is whether the author is at fault even though they were honest.\n\nI need to consider a few angles. Legally, there's no issue since all parties are adults. But socially, relationships between people in certain roles (like a friend's parent) can be frowned upon, even if consensual. The author did try to be honest, which is a point in their favor. However, the act itself is crossing a social boundary that many people would consider inappropriate regardless of honesty. \n\nThe friend's mom might be okay, but the friend is clearly hurt. The author's choice to continue the relationship despite the friend's objection and the resulting social fallout complicates things. Even if they were honest, the relationship's nature could be seen as a breach of trust and social norms. \n\nSo, while the author might not have broken any laws, they might still be in the wrong socially. The key point is the impact on the friend and the social dynamics. Honesty doesn't necessarily make the situation right; the action itself is what's causing the conflict. So, the answer might lean towards A.\n"
