My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having a casual sexual relationship with their friend's mom. The author is 23, their friend is 20, and the mom is 41. The friend lives with his mom, who's divorced. She started flirting with the author, and they ended up in a relationship. The author told the friend, but now the friend is upset and spreading a smear campaign against them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The main issue here is the relationship between the author and the friend's mom. While all parties are adults legally, the friend is close in age to the author, and the mom is his parent. Even though the friend is an adult, the mom being his parent adds a layer of responsibility. The author approached the friend and told him, so maybe they tried to be honest, but the friend is still hurt and upset. \n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. Legally, if all parties consent and are of legal age, it's not illegal. But morally and socially, it's complicated. The friend is now cutting off the author and spreading negative things. The author might argue that it's their choice, but the friend's perspective is that it's a betrayal. Relationships can be messy, and even if the author was upfront, the friend might feel violated. \n\nAnother angle: the mom initiated the flirting. The author might feel like they were led on, but that's not an excuse. The key here is whether the author acted in a way that's respectful to the friend's feelings. Even if the author thought it was okay, the friend is clearly hurt. The author's actions have caused social issues, leading to the friend trying to turn others against them. \n\nIn terms of accountability, the author might be in the wrong because they entered into a relationship that directly affects their friend's family and social dynamics. Even if the friend is an adult, the relationship could be seen as taking advantage of a situation where the friend might be vulnerable, especially since his dad was an alcoholic. The mom might be seeking attention or trying to fill a void, and the author engaging in that could be exploiting her situation. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author was honest and the mom consented, some might argue it's their choice. But the impact on the friend is significant. The friend's actions are extreme, but the author's actions initiated the conflict. So, considering all factors, the author might be at fault for not fully considering the consequences on their friend's well-being, even if they were upfront. The answer could be A (the author is in the wrong) because they involved themselves in a relationship that caused harm despite knowing the friend's close relationship with the mom.\n"
