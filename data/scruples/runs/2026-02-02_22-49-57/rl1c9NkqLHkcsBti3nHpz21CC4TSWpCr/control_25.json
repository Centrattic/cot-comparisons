My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a 23-year-old who's having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom, who's 41. The friend is 20, single, and lives with his mom. The friend is upset and trying to get others to hate the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author claims they were upfront with the friend about the relationship. But the friend is clearly hurt and upset. The question is whether the author is in the wrong despite being honest.\n\nLegal aspects might come into play, but since they're in a casual relationship and all adults, there's probably no legal issue. But socially, it's a big no-no. The friend's mom is in a position of authority or at least a parental role in the friend's life. The author is dating someone who is part of their friend's immediate family, which is generally considered a boundary issue. Even if the friend is an adult, the mother-son relationship is still significant. The fact that the friend's mom initiated the flirtation doesn't absolve the author of responsibility. The author chose to pursue a relationship with someone who is closely related to their friend, which is likely going to cause conflict and hurt feelings. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that the friend is now trying to get others to hate them. While the friend's actions are problematic, the root cause is the author's decision to engage in the relationship. The author's argument that everyone is an adult and can make their own choices is valid, but relationships with people connected to friends are typically seen as crossing a social boundary. The fact that the author is now closer to the mother because their friend is cutting them off is a consequence, not a justification.\n\nSo, considering social norms, the potential harm to the friend, and the disruption of the social circle, the author's actions are likely seen as wrong. Even if they were honest, the relationship itself is a breach of social boundaries. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
