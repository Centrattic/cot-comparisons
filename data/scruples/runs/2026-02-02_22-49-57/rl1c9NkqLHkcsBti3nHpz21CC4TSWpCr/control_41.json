My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that a 23-year-old has a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom, who is 41. The friend is 20, so there's a parent-child relationship involved. The user says he was upfront and honest with his friend, but the friend is upset and spreading negative things about him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and moral implications. The key points here are the relationships involved. The mom is the parent of his friend, so there's a familial connection. Even if the mom initiated the flirting, the dynamics of a parent-child relationship can be complex. The user might argue that all adults are consenting, but the social and emotional impact on the friend is significant. The friend is young, and the parent's actions might be seen as taking advantage of a situation where the friend is vulnerable, especially since the mom is a single parent and the dad was an alcoholic. \n\nAlso, even if the user was honest, the act of engaging in a relationship with someone's parent can be considered a breach of social boundaries. The user's actions have caused a rift in the friend group, leading to isolation. While the user claims everyone is an adult, the context of the relationship (mother of a close friend) complicates things. The mother might have a power dynamic over her son, even if she's not his parent in that situation anymore. \n\nAnother angle is the emotional harm caused to the friend. The user might not be in the wrong legally, but socially and morally, it's a gray area. The fact that the friend is trying to get others to hate the user shows the severity of the conflict. The user's justification that \"everyone is an adult\" might not account for the emotional and familial bonds that are being disrupted. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, even though the user was honest, the relationship itself is likely to be seen as wrong because of the dynamics involved and the harm caused to the friend and the social circle. The answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
