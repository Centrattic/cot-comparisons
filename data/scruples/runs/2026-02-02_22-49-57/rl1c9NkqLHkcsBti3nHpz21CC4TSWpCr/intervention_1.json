My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom. The situation involves several factors: the ages of the people involved, the nature of the relationship, and the impact on friendships.\n\nFirst, the author is 23, his friend is 20, and the mother is 41. All are adults, so legally there's no issue. The mother initiated the flirtation, and the author was upfront with the friend. The friend is upset and has started a smear campaign. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but the question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nLegally, there's no problem as all parties are adults. However, socially and ethically, it's more complicated. The author is close friends with the guy whose mom he's with, which can cause personal conflicts. Even if honest, the relationship can be seen as crossing a boundary, especially since the friend might feel betrayed. The mother's situation (divorced, living with her son) adds another layer. The son might feel uncomfortable with someone in his home who is close to his age and in a relationship with his mom, especially if they were previously just friends.\n\nThe author argues that everyone is an adult and should make their own choices. But the social dynamics here are tricky. The friend's reaction is understandable, even if the author was honest. The fact that the author is still pursuing the relationship despite the friend's objections and the resulting fallout suggests that he might not be considering the emotional impact on the friend. The mother's age and the son's age gap might make it seem like an age-appropriate relationship, but the pre-existing friendship complicates things.\n\nSo, even though the author was upfront, the act of engaging in a relationship with a friend's parent can be seen as crossing a social boundary. The key point is whether the author respected the boundaries of the social relationships. The friend's perspective is valid in feeling hurt and betrayed, regardless of the legality. Therefore, while there's no legal wrong, socially and ethically, the author might be in the wrong for disrupting the friend's life and causing a rift in the social circle. Hence, the answer would be A.\n"
