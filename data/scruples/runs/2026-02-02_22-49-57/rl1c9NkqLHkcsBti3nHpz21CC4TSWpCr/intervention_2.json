My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a 23-year-old having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom, who is 41. The friend is 20 and upset, leading to social issues.\n\nFirst, the key points: All parties are adults. The author was upfront with the friend. The mother initiated the relationship. The friend is now trying to ostracize the author. The author feels the friend is overreacting because adults should be able to make their own choices.\n\nNow, considering social norms and ethics. Even though legally adults can make their own decisions, relationships between someone and their friend's parent can be seen as crossing a boundary. There's a power dynamic here; the friend is in a dependent role living with his mom. The mother might feel more vulnerable, but she's an adult and made the choice. However, the author's friend is hurt and the social fallout is significant. \n\nEthically, it's complicated. Some might argue the author is in the wrong because of the familial relationship, even if it's not blood-related. Others might say it's consensual adults, so it's their choice. The author being honest is a positive, but the impact on the friend's life and their social circle is real. The mother's actions could also be a point of discussion\u2014was she in a position where she needed to pursue this relationship, or was she the one initiating?\n\nThe answer hinges on whether the relationship is considered a boundary violation. Even if consensual, the closeness of the original friendship and the friend's living situation might make this a sensitive situation. The author might be seen as taking advantage of the friend's trust or the mother's position as a caregiver. However, if the mother was the one initiating and the author was upfront, some might argue it's not the author's fault. But traditionally, such relationships are often viewed as problematic due to the inherent power and emotional dynamics. So, the answer is likely A (in the wrong) because of the breach of trust and social boundaries, even if consensual.\n"
