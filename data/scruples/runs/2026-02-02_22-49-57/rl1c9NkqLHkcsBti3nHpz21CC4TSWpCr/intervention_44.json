My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about having a casual sexual relationship with their friend's mom.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. The author is 23, the friend is 20, and the mom is 41. The friend's mom is divorced and living with her son. She was flirting with the author when he visited their house. The author thought she was being playful but then things escalated. He asked her out, they had a casual relationship for a month and a half. He was upfront with the friend, who is now upset and trying to get others to hate him.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The mom and the author are both adults, so legally, there's no issue with the relationship itself in terms of age. But there's a social and ethical component here. The friend is 20, which is still a minor in some places, but the key issue is the relationship between the author and the mother.\n\nEven though the author was honest with his friend, the friend is clearly hurt. The mother continued to flirt and escalate things, which the author reciprocated. The author might argue that the mother initiated and that all parties were adults, but the friend's well-being is a concern. The author is causing emotional distress to his friend, which could be seen as a betrayal of trust. The friend's mom might be an adult, but the dynamic of being in a relationship with someone's parent, especially when the child is still young, is complicated. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the friend's reaction. The friend is trying to turn others against the author, but the author's actions might have crossed a social boundary. Even if it's consensual between the author and the mother, the impact on the friend and their social circle is significant. The author might be right in thinking adults can make their own choices, but the context of the relationship (with a minor's parent) adds another layer. \n\nIt's possible the author isn't legally wrong, but socially or ethically, he might be. The key is whether the author acted with consideration for his friend's feelings and the potential consequences. The friend's mom might have her own responsibilities in maintaining boundaries, but the author's role in engaging in the relationship despite the friend's likely discomfort once he found out is questionable. \n\nSo, while the author was upfront, the situation is still problematic because it's a relationship with a minor's parent, and the friend is clearly hurt. The author might not be in the wrong legally, but socially, he's probably in the wrong because of the impact on his friend and the social dynamics.\n"
