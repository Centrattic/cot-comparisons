My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a 23-year-old having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom, who is 41. The friend is 20 and upset about this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The ages here: the author is 23, the friend is 20, and his mom is 41. Legally, in most places, the age of consent is around 16 or 18, so the 18-year-old friend is an adult. However, the relationship is between the author (23) and the mother (41), so the age of consent isn't the issue here. But there's a power dynamic because the friend is still living with his mom, and the author is engaging with her while being close friends with the son.\n\nNext, the ethical angle. The author claims they were upfront with the friend. But even if they were honest, the act of pursuing a romantic or sexual relationship with an adult who is the parent of someone you're friends with can be seen as ethically questionable. It's not illegal, but it's socially sensitive. The friend is upset and feels betrayed, which makes sense given the familial relationship.\n\nThe author also mentions that the mother was flirting first, which might not absolve them of responsibility. Even if the mother initiated, the author made the choice to engage in the relationship. The fact that the friend is now trying to ostracize the author because of this shows the social repercussions, which the author is aware of but still continues the relationship.\n\nAnother point: the author says they've been open with their friend. However, the friend's reaction is a significant consequence. The author's decision to continue the relationship despite the friend's disapproval and the resulting social fallout might be seen as selfish or inconsiderate, even if everyone is an adult. The phrase \"everyone is an adult\" is often used to justify such relationships, but in this context, the closeness to the friend complicates things.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the mother's divorce was recent (two years ago), so there's a potential for unresolved issues or emotional vulnerability. The author's proximity to both the mother and her son could be seen as taking advantage of a situation where the mother might be seeking emotional support or connection, especially after a divorce.\n\nIn terms of relationships, even if consensual, the dynamics here are delicate. The author's actions are causing harm to the friendship and the social circle. The question is whether the harm caused is a valid reason to consider the author in the wrong, despite the consensual nature of the relationship.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Legally, not in the wrong. Ethically, there's a strong argument that the author is in the wrong because they've caused significant distress to a friend and are disrupting the social group. The act of continuing the relationship despite the friend's clear disapproval and the resulting social consequences suggests a lack of consideration for the friend's feelings and the potential lasting damage to multiple relationships. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
