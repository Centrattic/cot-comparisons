My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a 23-year-old having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom, who's 41. The friend is 20 and upset, leading to social issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the age aspect. The author is 23, the friend is 20. The mom is 41. So all parties are adults. Legally, there's no issue because everyone is of age. But the dynamics here are complex. The mom was the one initiating flirtation, and the author says he was upfront with the friend. But even though he was honest, the friend is still upset and spreading negative things about him.\n\nNow, the question is about moral or social wrongness, not legal. Even if all parties are adults, there's the aspect of the relationship being with someone's parent. It could cause lasting damage to the friend's relationship with his mom, especially if the friend is still close to her. Also, the fact that the friend is trying to get friends to hate the author shows how hurt he is, which might suggest that the author's actions were insensitive.\n\nEven though the author was honest, the situation inherently involves a power dynamic. The mom is in a parental role in the friend's life, so pursuing a relationship with her could be seen as taking advantage of a vulnerable position, especially if the friend is still living with her. The author might not have considered how this would affect the friend's family dynamics.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is an adult and the mom is an adult. If both consented to a casual relationship, some might argue that it's their choice. But the key issue here is the close friendship with the son. The author's actions directly impact the son's relationship with his mother, which is a significant ethical concern. The son's age (20) might mean he's still dependent on his mom, but since he's an adult, that's a bit ambiguous. However, the emotional impact on the son is clear, and the author's insistence on continuing the relationship despite the son's distress could be seen as selfish.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, even though the author was upfront, the nature of the relationship and its impact on the friend's well-being makes it likely that the author is in the wrong. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
