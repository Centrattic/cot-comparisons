My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom. The situation is complicated, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the key points: The author is 23, the friend is 20, and the mom is 41. The mom was openly flirting with the author before the friend knew, and they ended up in a casual relationship. The author told the friend, as the mom insisted, and the friend is now upset, trying to get others to turn against him. The author thinks everyone is an adult and can make their own choices but is facing backlash.\n\nSo, the main question is about morality here. Legally, there's no issue because all parties are adults. But socially and ethically, it's a gray area. The friend is the mother's child, so there's a family bond. Even if they're not living together anymore, the mother is still part of his family. The author might be in a position where the friend feels betrayed, and the mother's actions could be seen as leading the younger man on, especially if she was already a single parent. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that the friend is 20, which might be relevant. If the author was 23 and the friend just turned 20, maybe the friend is still in a sensitive phase, transitioning into adulthood, and this relationship might feel especially intrusive. The fact that the author told the friend upfront is a point in his favor, but the way the friend is reacting is extreme. However, the author might not have considered the emotional impact on the friend, even if it's not his fault. \n\nAnother angle is the power dynamics. The mother is a parent figure, albeit divorced, and the author is in a friend group with her child. The relationship could disrupt that dynamic regardless of consent. The author's argument that adults can make their own choices is valid, but relationships involving family members often carry additional layers of complexity and potential harm beyond the individuals involved.\n\nI should also consider cultural or societal norms. In many places, relationships with someone's parent can be seen as taboo or inappropriate, regardless of legality. The author's actions might be causing lasting damage to friendships and the friend's mental health, which could be a factor in determining if he's in the wrong. Even if he's not legally wrong, the social consequences are significant, and he might be considered morally at fault for not anticipating how this would affect his friend's social circle and mental well-being.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author isn't breaking any laws, the ethical considerations, especially regarding family relationships and the impact on others, suggest that he might be in the wrong. The answer would likely be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because, despite being upfront, the relationship created harm and disrupted the friend's life, which is a moral consideration beyond just legal permissibility.\n"
