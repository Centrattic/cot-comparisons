My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for having a casual sexual relationship with their friend's mom. The situation is pretty complex, so I need to break it down carefully.\n\nFirst, the author is 23, their friend is 20, and the mom is 41. The friend's mom started flirting openly with the author when they visited the house. The author initially thought it was playful, but it escalated, leading to a casual relationship. The author was upfront with the friend about it, but the friend is upset and spreading a smear campaign against the author. The author now feels closer to the mom because of the situation.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is at fault. I need to consider several angles: consent, honesty, social dynamics, and ethical considerations.\n\nStarting with consent: All parties involved\u2014author, friend's mom, and the friend\u2014are adults. The relationship between the author and the mom is consensual. The author was honest with the friend, which is a point in their favor. The mom initiated the flirting, and the author didn't force the relationship. So consent is present here.\n\nHonesty: The author did tell the friend, which is important. However, even though they were upfront, the friend still reacted negatively. But being honest doesn't necessarily absolve the author of responsibility in terms of social consequences. The friend feels betrayed, which is a valid emotion, even if the author was truthful.\n\nSocial dynamics: The author is now facing social backlash from mutual friends. The friend is trying to turn people against the author. While the author didn't create the conflict out of nowhere, their actions did cause a rift. The author might have known that this could happen but chose to proceed, which could be seen as a lack of consideration for the friend's feelings.\n\nEthical considerations: Some people might argue that sleeping with a friend's parent is inherently problematic because it can destroy a friendship and cause emotional harm. Even if the friend is an adult, the relationship crosses a boundary that many consider inappropriate. The author's defense is that everyone is an adult and can make their own choices, but societal norms often view such relationships as taboo, especially in a social circle where the friend is involved.\n\nLegal perspective: In most places, as long as both the author and the mom are adults, the relationship isn't illegal. So legally, the author isn't in the wrong. But legality doesn't always equate to moral or social correctness.\n\nEmotional impact: The friend is clearly hurt and distressed. The author's actions led to a breakdown in their friendship and the friend's social circle. Even if the author was honest, the emotional fallout is significant. The author might feel justified, but the consequences are real and harmful.\n\nPersonal responsibility: The author could have considered the potential impact on their friend and social group before engaging in the relationship. While it's consensual, the author's choice to pursue it despite knowing the possible consequences might be seen as irresponsible.\n\nSo, weighing these factors: The author isn't breaking any laws, was honest, and the relationship is consensual. However, the social and emotional damage to the friend is considerable. Whether the author is \"in the wrong\" depends on the moral standpoint. Some might say they are because of the harm caused to the friend's social life and emotional well-being, while others might say it's their right as adults to choose their partners.\n\nBut the key point is that even though the author was honest, the act itself is socially frowned upon and caused significant issues. The author might not be legally wrong, but morally, they could be seen as at fault for not considering the friend's feelings and the potential consequences. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because of the harm caused, despite the consensual and honest nature of the relationship.\n"
