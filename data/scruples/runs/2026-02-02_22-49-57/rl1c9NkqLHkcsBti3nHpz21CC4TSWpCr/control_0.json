My friend is 20 and lives with his single, divorced mom (41). She divorced his dad two years ago for being an alcoholic. Shes extremely hot in a more mature kind of way.\n\nWhenever i would hang out at his house his mom would openly flirt with me but i initially just chalked that up to her being playful and flirty. Except she kept up the flirting when we were alone, and everyime i stepped it up she would step it up herself.\n\nI asked her out, and weve had a casual sexual relationship for almost a month and a half. I was very open with my friend, his mom insisted on it and i dont want to hurt him.\n\nHe is completely put off by it, which i can understand, but at the same time everyone is an adult and can make their own choices. He orders me to stop seeing her and i refuse. He is now actively trying to get all of our friends to hate me and its been semi successful.\n\nEven if i stopped seeing his mom i dont believe he will let up with the smear campaign. Oddly enough this has actually driven me closer to his mom since im running out of friends.\n\nAITA in this situation even if i was upfront and honest with him?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA scenario. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having a casual sexual relationship with his friend's mom. Let's break down the details.\n\nFirst, the author is 23, his friend is 20, and the mom is 41. The friend's parents divorced two years ago because of the dad's alcoholism. The mom has been flirting with the author, and they started a casual relationship. The author told his friend, who is now upset and trying to get their friends to hate him. The author feels he's not in the wrong because everyone is an adult and made their own choices.\n\nHmm, the key points here are the relationships involved. The friend is still living with his mom, and the author started a relationship with her. Even though the author was upfront, the friend is clearly hurt. The mom's divorce happened two years ago, so maybe she's single and not in a relationship, but the dynamics here are tricky. The author might be overstepping because the friend and his mom are in a parent-child relationship. The mom's behavior in flirtatious situations with someone her son is close to could be a red flag. Also, the author's actions are causing a rift in their social circle, which is a consequence he's facing.\n\nLegally, maybe there's no issue if everyone is consenting adults. But socially and ethically, the situation is complicated. The mom is in a position of responsibility over her son, and getting involved with someone her son is friends with could be seen as taking advantage of that dynamic. Even if the author was honest, the relationship is causing significant harm to the friend, who is still dependent on his mom. The author might be in the wrong because he didn't consider the impact on his friend and the potential for conflict. The fact that the friend's mom stepped up her flirting after the author did raises questions about mutual consent, but the power imbalance between her and her son adds another layer. The answer likely leans towards A (author is in the wrong) because the relationship is creating a hostile environment and exploiting a familial relationship.\n"
