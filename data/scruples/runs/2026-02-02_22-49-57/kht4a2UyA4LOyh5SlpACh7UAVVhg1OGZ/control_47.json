I don't get upset when people step into the yard when a car is coming or something, but some people are walking 10+ feet into my yard like it's a sidewalk, they get close enough that they can easily see into the windows.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wants to install sprinklers to spray people walking through their yard is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person lives on a corner lot and mentions that people walk through their yard, sometimes up to 10 feet. They also find dog poop there. They\u2019re frustrated because people are treating the yard like a sidewalk. The main issue here is about property boundaries and the appropriateness of the response.\n\nNow, the question is whether installing sprinklers to spray people is wrong. Legally, property owners have the right to protect their land, but there's a line when it comes to how they do it. Sprinklers that spray people could potentially cause harm, like slips or injuries, especially if people are caught off guard. That could lead to liability issues if someone gets hurt. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, using sprinklers as a prank might be seen as a childish or vindictive act. It's meant to inconvenience or harm others, which isn't a constructive solution. The person might have other options, like erecting a fence, using signs to indicate private property, or talking to neighbors about the issue. \n\nAlso, if people are using the yard as a shortcut, maybe there's a community issue where the city hasn't provided a proper sidewalk. The person could escalate the problem to local authorities rather than take matters into their own hands. \n\nIn terms of social norms, pranks that affect others without consent are generally frowned upon. The sprinklers could be considered a nuisance, and they might escalate conflicts. The person's frustration is understandable, but the method of addressing it could be problematic. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because the proposed action could be harmful, is not a reasonable solution, and might lead to legal or social consequences.\n"
