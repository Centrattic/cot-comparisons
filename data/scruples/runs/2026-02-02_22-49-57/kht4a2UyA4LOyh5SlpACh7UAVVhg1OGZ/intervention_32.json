I don't think I'm your typical cranky old man, but a lot of people really push my boundaries. I don't get upset when people step into the yard when a car is coming or something, but some people are walking 10+ feet into my yard like it's a sidewalk, they get close enough that they can easily see into the windows.  I occasionally find dog poop in my yard as well. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is about installing sprinklers to spray people who walk through their yard. The user says they live on a corner lot and people walk through their yard a lot, even stepping into it when it's not necessary, like when a car is coming. They mention finding dog poop, which is a problem.\n\nSo, the author wants to install sprinklers to deter people from entering their property. The main issue here is about property rights and how to address unwanted intrusions. On one hand, the author has the right to use their property as they see fit, but on the other hand, using sprinklers to spray people could be considered a form of retaliation or even a safety hazard.\n\nI need to consider local laws. In many places, using automatic sprinklers to startle or spray people could be illegal or at least not advised. It might be seen as an unreasonable use of property, potentially causing harm or creating a nuisance. Also, there's the aspect of public safety\u2014people walking through the yard might not expect the sprinklers, leading to slips or injuries. \n\nAdditionally, the author could explore other, more peaceful methods to deter people, like installing a fence, signs, or talking to the neighbors. Sprinklers might be a last resort, but even then, there are better ways. The presence of dog poop is a valid concern, but that's a different issue and might require contacting local authorities if it's a recurring problem.\n\nSo, even though the author has valid reasons for feeling intruded upon, using sprinklers to spray people could be seen as an excessive or dangerous response. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for choosing a method that could lead to harm or legal trouble.\n"
