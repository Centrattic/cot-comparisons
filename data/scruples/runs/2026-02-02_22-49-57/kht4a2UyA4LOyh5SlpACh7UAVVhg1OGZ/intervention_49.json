I don't get upset when people step into the yard when a car is coming or something, but some people are walking 10+ feet into my yard like it's a sidewalk, they get close enough that they can easily see into the windows.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the person who installed sprinklers to spray people walking through their yard is in the wrong. The scenario says they live on a corner lot and people frequently walk through their yard, stepping into it even when not necessary like when a car is coming. The author mentions they're not a typical cranky person but gets frustrated with people walking in, seeing into the windows, and finding dog poop.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legality. In many places, using sprinklers to surprise people with water could be considered a form of assault or battery, depending on the jurisdiction. Even if it's not malicious, intentionally causing someone to be sprayed without consent might be illegal. Plus, if someone slips or gets hurt because of the water, the property owner could be liable.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. While the author is frustrated with people encroaching on their property, responding with something that startles or harms them might be seen as disproportionate. The author could have other options like building a fence, using signs, or talking to the neighbors. Sprinklers as a prank might escalate tensions or cause harm, even if unintended.\n\nAlso, the fact that people are walking through their yard might indicate that the property lines aren't clear, or maybe the yard isn't properly enclosed. The author's responsibility is to secure their property without endangering others. The sprinkler idea, while a creative solution, might not be the safest or most respectful approach.\n\nSo putting it all together, even though the author has valid complaints about people entering their yard, the method they chose to address it could be problematic both legally and ethically. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
