I don't get upset when people step into the yard when a car is coming or something, but some people are walking 10+ feet into my yard like it's a sidewalk, they get close enough that they can easily see into the windows.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for installing sprinklers to spray people walking through their yard. The author mentions that people walk through their corner lot yard a lot, even 10+ feet in, and they find dog poop there too. The question is whether installing sprinklers as a deterrent is wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider property rights. In most places, you own your property and can control who enters. However, if people are walking through without permission, the author has the right to prevent that. But using sprinklers to actively spray them could be an issue.\n\nThen, the legal aspect. Intentionally causing harm or distress might be illegal. Spraying someone with water could lead to slip and fall risks or other hazards. Even if it's just a surprise, it might be considered assault or battery if it causes harm. Also, some places have laws about using devices that could injure people.\n\nMoral and ethical considerations. The author is frustrated, but using a surprise sprinkler to deter people might be seen as a prank but could be dangerous, especially if someone is walking with a phone, in heels, or has a medical condition. The intention is to protect property, but the method could be excessive.\n\nThere's also the issue of public vs. private space. If the path is a common sidewalk or pathway, the author can't block it. But if it's their yard, they can set boundaries. However, deterring people with a prank might not be the best approach. Maybe better solutions are visible signs, fencing, or talking to neighbors first.\n\nThe author mentions \"WIBTA\" (Would I Be Terrible for...), which suggests they're considering the social repercussions. Even if legally allowed, socially it might be frowned upon. People might see it as a mean trick rather than a reasonable boundary.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Legally, maybe not in the wrong if they have the right to protect their property, but the method could be problematic. However, ethically and socially, it's questionable because it could cause harm or be seen as an unnecessary prank. The answer likely depends on local laws, but generally, using a potentially harmful prank device could be considered wrong.\n"
