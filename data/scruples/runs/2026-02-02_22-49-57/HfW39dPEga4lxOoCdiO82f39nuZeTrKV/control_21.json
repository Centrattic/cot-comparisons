My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a custody arrangement where the author and their ex have 50/50 custody, switching every other week. The ex wants the kids to go to a family reunion at Disneyland during the author's week, but the author refuses because it's their time. The kids are upset, thinking the author is preventing them from going. The author is frustrated and wants to know if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the custody agreement. The author mentions they have a 50/50 split and that they agreed not to plan things on days that aren't theirs unless it's extremely important. The author has never switched weeks before, even if the ex begged. The ex is now asking to switch a week for the reunion, but the author says no because it's their week. The ex is telling the kids that the author is the bad guy, making it seem like they're being selfish. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that it's their time with the kids, and the ex scheduled the event during their week. The author feels it's unfair for the ex to expect a switch. The kids are upset, but the author stands by their decision. \n\nNow, considering legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if the custody agreement is strict and they can't switch weeks without mutual agreement, then the author is within their rights. The ex is asking for a switch, but the author isn't obligated unless there's an agreement. The ex's parents scheduled it during the author's time, so maybe the ex should have considered that when planning. \n\nHowever, from an emotional standpoint, the kids are upset because they want to go to Disneyland. The author's refusal might be seen as prioritizing their own time over the kids' wishes. But the author's stance is about upholding the custody agreement. \n\nThe ex is portrayed as being manipulative, telling the kids the author is blocking the trip. The author is defensive, thinking they're not being unfair. The key points are the agreed-upon custody rules and whether the author violated them. Since the author followed the agreement and the ex didn't, the author might not be in the wrong. \n\nBut maybe there's a nuance. If the ex's parents had a family event that was important, perhaps the author could have been more flexible. However, the author has a history of not switching weeks even when asked, so consistency here could be a point in their favor. \n\nIn summary, the author is adhering to the custody agreement, which the ex is trying to bend. The author isn't violating any terms, so they aren't in the wrong. The ex's actions are the issue here. The kids are caught in the middle, but the fault lies more with the ex for trying to manipulate the situation.\n"
