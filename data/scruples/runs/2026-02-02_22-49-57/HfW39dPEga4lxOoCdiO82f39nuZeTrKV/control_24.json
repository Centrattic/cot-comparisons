My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting their kids go on vacation with the ex during their scheduled time. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The parents have a 50/50 custody agreement, alternating every other week for 8 years. The author and ex don't talk much and only communicate about the kids. The key point is the custody schedule: the ex asked to switch weeks for a family reunion at Disneyland during the author's time. The author refused, leading the kids to be upset because they think the author is blocking them from going.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author is violating the custody agreement. The agreement states they don't plan things on days that aren't theirs and don't switch weeks unless extremely important. The ex's parents scheduled the reunion during the author's week without rescheduling, which the author isn't willing to give up. The author didn't ask for any switches before, so this seems like the ex is trying to change the schedule without agreement.\n\nLegally, if the custody agreement is structured as a 50/50 with strict terms, the author has the right to their scheduled weeks. The ex's request to switch would require mutual agreement, which the author isn't giving. The author isn't violating the agreement by not switching. The ex is trying to use the kids to pressure the author, which is manipulative. The kids are upset because they were told the author is the bad guy, but the author's action is within their rights based on the agreement.\n\nHowever, from the kids' perspective, they might feel both parents are being unfair. The author's refusal could be seen as prioritizing their time over the kids' wishes. But the author is following the legal agreement. The ex isn't respecting the agreement by asking for a switch without the author's consent. The author isn't in the wrong for upholding the custody terms. The ex is the one trying to manipulate the situation. So the answer should be B.\n"
