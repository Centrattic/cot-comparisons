My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The question is whether the parent who's refusing to give up their custody week to go to Disneyland is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the custody arrangement. The parents have a 50/50 split, alternating weeks. The key point is that they agreed not to plan things on days that aren't theirs unless it's extremely important. The ex wants to take the kids during the author's week. The author has never switched weeks before, even if asked. This time, the ex is asking to switch, but the author says no. \n\nThe ex's parents are hosting a reunion at Disneyland, which is a big event. The kids are upset because they see the parent as the bad guy for not letting them go. The author explains it's their time, but the kids feel it's unfair. The ex isn't helping by not apologetizing.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the custody agreement is clear and the parent is following the terms, they have the right to keep their scheduled time. The ex is asking to switch, but since the agreement is strict unless it's extremely important, maybe the ex's request isn't \"extremely important\" enough. The author is holding their ground based on the original agreement.\n\nEmotionally, the kids are hurt because they want to go on the vacation. The author is being firm, but the ex isn't explaining the situation properly, leading to the kids thinking the author is being unfair. The author is trying to maintain boundaries, which is important in a co-parenting situation, even if it's causing short-term conflict.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they're upholding the custody agreement. The ex is the one trying to change the schedule, and the author is within their rights to say no. The kids are upset, but that's more about the ex's poor communication and not the author's fault. The answer should be B (No).\n"
