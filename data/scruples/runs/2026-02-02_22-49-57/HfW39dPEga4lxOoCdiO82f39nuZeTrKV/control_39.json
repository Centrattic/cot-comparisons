My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a custody arrangement where the parent (author) and their ex have a 50/50 split, switching every other week. The ex wants the kids to go to a family reunion at Disneyland during the author's week, but the author refuses, leading to the kids being upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the custody agreement. The author mentions they have a strict agreement where they don't plan things on days that aren't theirs and rarely switch weeks unless it's extremely important. The author has never switched weeks in 8 years, even when asked. So according to their agreement, the author is following the rules. The ex is trying to switch a week without any prior precedent, which the author is refusing. That seems fair based on the terms they agreed upon.\n\nNext, the ex's side: he wants to take the kids to Disneyland during his parents' reunion, which is a family event. The author is within their rights to not switch weeks because it's their scheduled time. However, the ex is portraying the author as the bad guy by not allowing the kids to go. The author is trying to explain it's their time, but the kids are taking the ex's side. The author feels wronged because they're sticking to the agreement.\n\nNow, considering the kids' reactions. The son is mad and not talking, the daughter is crying. The author is upset that the kids are upset, but the main issue is the custody agreement. The author isn't violating any terms, so they shouldn't be blamed for enforcing what they agreed to. The ex is the one trying to change the schedule without prior agreement. The author's refusal isn't malicious; it's about upholding the custody arrangement. The ex's actions might be causing conflict by trying to switch weeks, but the author is just following the rules. The kids are being manipulated by the ex to see the author as the villain, which is a common issue in co-parenting conflicts.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they're adhering to the custody agreement. The ex is misusing the situation by trying to change the schedule without mutual agreement. The kids are caught in the middle, but the author's fault lies in not switching when it's their time. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
