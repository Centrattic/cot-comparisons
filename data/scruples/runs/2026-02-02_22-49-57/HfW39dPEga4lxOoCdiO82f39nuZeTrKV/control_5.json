My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a custody arrangement where the parent (author) is refusing to let their kids go on a vacation with the ex during their scheduled time. The kids are upset, and the ex is trying to portray the author as the bad guy.\n\nFirst, the custody agreement is 50/50, and they've agreed not to switch weeks unless it's extremely important. The ex wants to take the kids to Disneyland on the author's week. The author refuses, thinking it's unfair since the ex's parents scheduled it during their time. The kids are mad, thinking the author is blocking the trip. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong. The key points here are the custody agreement and the ex's actions. The author followed the agreement by not switching weeks, which was their understanding from the beginning. The ex is trying to make a special arrangement without mutual agreement. The author's stance is about upholding their custody rights. However, the kids are suffering emotionally, feeling like they can't go on the trip they wanted.\n\nBut the author isn't violating the custody agreement. The ex is the one requesting a switch, and the author is refusing, which is within their rights. However, the ex is using the kids to push the author, which could be manipulative. The kids are upset because they believe the author is the bad guy, but that's because the ex is framing it that way. The author is standing by their agreement, which they had for 8 years. \n\nBut maybe the author could have considered the kids' feelings more. Even though it's their week, the kids wanted to go to Disneyland. Maybe there's a way to compromise, like planning a different trip or letting the kids go for part of the week? But the author's strict stance might be causing unnecessary hurt. However, if the agreement is non-negotiable except in emergencies, the author isn't in the wrong for sticking to it. The ex is the one who scheduled the trip during the author's time, so it's their fault for not planning around the custody schedule. \n\nThe kids' reactions might be due to the ex's influence. The author isn't wrong in a legal or agreement sense, but emotionally, the kids are suffering. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they followed the agreement and the ex initiated the request, the answer is B (not in the wrong). However, maybe the author could have tried to find a middle ground, but strictly by the rules, they're not at fault.\n"
