My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their kids go on vacation with their ex during their scheduled time. \n\nFirst, the background: They have a 50/50 custody agreement, which they've been following for 8 years. The ex wants to take the kids to Disneyland during the author's week, but the author refused to switch weeks. The kids are upset because their dad told them the mom won't let them go. The author feels it's their right to have the kids during their week, and the ex isn't helping by making the author look bad.\n\nSo, the key points here are the custody agreement and the ex's actions. The custody agreement was agreed upon by both parties, and the author has consistently followed it without switching days unless necessary. The ex is trying to schedule a big event during the author's time without switching weeks, which the author is refusing. The ex isn't allowing the author to explain, making the author look like the bad guy to the kids. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for upholding their custody rights. The ex is the one who scheduled the trip during the author's time without a switch. The author's refusal to give up their week is based on the agreed-upon terms. The kids being upset is due to the ex's poor communication and manipulation, not the author's actions. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're standing by their custody agreement, and the ex is the one violating the terms by not respecting the schedule. The kids are being misled by the ex's narrative, but the author is justified in their actions.\n"
