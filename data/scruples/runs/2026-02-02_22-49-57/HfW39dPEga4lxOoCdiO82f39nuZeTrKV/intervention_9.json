My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a parent\u4e0d\u8ba9 kids go on a vacation with the ex during their scheduled time. The author has a 50/50 custody agreement and refused to switch weeks, leading to the kids being upset.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect. The custody agreement is 50/50 and they agreed not to plan things on each other's weeks unless it's extremely important. The author has followed this agreement strictly for 8 years. The ex tried to schedule a family reunion during the author's week. The author refused, which is within the terms they agreed on. Legally, the author isn't violating anything.\n\nNext, the kids' reactions. The son is angry and the daughter is crying because the ex painted the author as the bad guy. But the author is standing by the custody agreement. The ex is using the kids to manipulate the situation, making the author look like they're blocking the vacation when actually it's the ex's own scheduling during the author's time.\n\nEmotionally, the kids are upset because they want to go on the trip. But the author's priority is their time with the kids. The ex isn't following the agreement by asking for a switch without a valid reason. The author's firmness is about respecting the custody terms, not trying to get back at the ex, as they claim.\n\nThe ex's refusal to apologize and his message about not telling the kids the truth suggests he's trying to maintain his narrative. The author tried to explain, but the kids are influenced by the ex's side. The author isn't at fault here; they're upholding their rights as per the agreement. The ex is the one breaking the agreement by scheduling the trip during the author's week without a valid reason and manipulating the kids.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The key points are the legal agreement terms, the author's adherence to them, and the ex's manipulation. The author isn't the asshole here; the ex is acting uncooperatively and undermining the custody arrangement.\n"
