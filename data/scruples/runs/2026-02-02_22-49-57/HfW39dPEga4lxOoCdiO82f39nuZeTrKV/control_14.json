My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not allowing their kids to go on a vacation with their ex during the author's custody week. The situation involves a 50/50 custody agreement, and the ex wants to switch weeks for a Disneyland trip. The author refused, leading to the kids being upset and the ex not helping clarify the situation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the custody agreement. They have a 50/50 setup with clear weeks, and both agreed not to switch unless it's extremely important. The author hasn't asked to switch in 8 years, so they're sticking to the agreement. The ex's request is during the author's week, which the author is entitled to. Legally, if the custody agreement is set, the author can't be forced to give up their time unless there's a court order or mutual agreement. \n\nThe ex's parents scheduled the reunion during the author's week. The ex is asking to switch, but the author is within their rights to say no. The kids are upset because they were led to believe the author is the bad guy for not allowing them to go. The author tried to explain, but the ex didn't help and even refused to apologize. \n\nNow, the main points: Did the author do something wrong? The custody agreement is in place, and the author is following it. The ex approached them for a switch, but the author isn't obligated to agree. The ex's parents made plans during the author's time, which isn't the author's fault. The kids are upset, but the author's priority is their time with them, which is valid. The ex isn't helping by not clarifying the situation, which is part of the conflict. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're upholding their custody rights. The ex is the one who initiated the request, which the author can refuse. The kids' emotions are a result of the ex's actions in portraying the author as the bad guy. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
