My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a custody dispute where the author is a parent who refused to switch weeks with their ex so their kids could go on a vacation to Disneyland during the ex's scheduled time.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the key points. The parents have a 50/50 custody agreement that they've been following for 8 years. The agreement states they don't plan things on days that aren't theirs and don't switch unless it's extremely important. The ex wants to take the kids to a family reunion at Disneyland during the author's week, so he asks to switch weeks. The author refuses, leading to the kids being upset and the ex blaming the author.\n\nThe author is now upset because the kids are mad at them, thinking the author is the bad guy for not letting them go. The ex is also not cooperating in explaining the situation.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The custody agreement was set up to have equal time, and the author has consistently followed it without giving up their time before. The ex is asking to switch during the author's week, but the agreement says they don't switch unless it's extremely important. The author feels it's unfair because the ex's parents scheduled it during their time, so the author isn't at fault for upholding their rights under the agreement.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the ex's request is a valid family event, but the agreement was clear. The author has the right to their scheduled time, and the ex should have planned accordingly. The kids are caught in the middle, but the author isn't the one breaking the agreement. The ex isn't following the terms by requesting a switch without an extreme situation. The author isn't wrong for sticking to the agreement, especially since they've always followed it. The kids are upset because they want to go, but the author isn't the one who scheduled the trip during their time. The ex's actions here might be more at fault for trying to manipulate the situation. So the author isn't in the wrong; the answer should be B.\n"
