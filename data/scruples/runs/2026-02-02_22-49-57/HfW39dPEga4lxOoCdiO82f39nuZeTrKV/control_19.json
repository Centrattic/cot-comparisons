My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a custody arrangement after a divorce. The author has a 50/50 custody schedule with their ex. The ex wants to take the kids to Disneyland during the author's custody week, but the author refuses because it's their time. The kids are upset, and the ex is portrayed as the bad guy by the children. The author is defending their decision, saying they've never switched days before and that the ex is trying to use the kids to get back at them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The custody agreement is 50/50, so the author has the right to their scheduled time. The ex is trying to take the kids during that time without switching weeks, which the author has refused. The ex's parents scheduled the event, but the author argues that it's on their week. The ex didn't propose a switch, and the author refused to give up their time. Legally, unless the custody agreement allows for flexibility, the author is within their rights. \n\nBut then there's the emotional impact on the kids. The children are upset because they don't want to miss Disneyland. The ex is using the kids' disappointment to paint the author as the villain. The author is trying to explain it's their time, but the kids don't see it that way. The author's ex isn't helping by not giving the kids the full context. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that the ex is trying to manipulate the kids. The author is standing by their decision because they've always stuck to the custody schedule. The ex's request seems to be a last-minute thing, and the author is firm on their rights. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't acting in bad faith. They have a right to their time. The ex is the one deviating from the agreement, not the author. The kids are caught in the middle, but the author's actions are based on the custody terms. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
