My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether they are the asshole for not letting their kids go on vacation with their ex during their own custody time.\n\nFirst, the situation: The parents have a 50/50 custody agreement, which has been in place for 8 years. The ex wants to take the kids to Disneyland during the author's week, but the author refuses to switch weeks or let the ex take the kids during their scheduled time. The kids are upset, the son is mad, the daughter is crying, and the ex is not helping by making the author look bad.\n\nSo, the key points here are the custody agreement. The parents agreed that they wouldn't switch days unless it's extremely important. The author has never given up their time before, even when asked. The ex is trying to convince the kids that the author is being unreasonable, but the author is standing by the agreement they had.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that it's their time with the kids, and they're not in a good relationship with the ex, so they don't want to compromise. The ex's side is that his parents have the reunion scheduled during the author's week and it's important for the whole family. But the author argues that the ex's parents should have scheduled it during their own week.\n\nNow, considering legal and ethical aspects. Legally, if the custody is 50/50 and there's a court order, the parent is supposed to follow it unless there's a valid reason to modify it. The author isn't violating the order by keeping the kids during their scheduled time. The ex is asking for a switch, but the author isn't obligated to agree unless it's an emergency or something extremely important. The author says they don't plan things on each other's days unless it's extremely important, and the ex's request doesn't meet that threshold.\n\nEthically, the author is standing by their commitment to the custody agreement. The ex is trying to bend the rules for this one instance, which the author feels is unfair. The kids are upset because they want to go to Disneyland, but the author is prioritizing their own time with the kids, which is part of their parenting rights. The ex is not helping by manipulating the situation to make the author look bad, which adds to the conflict.\n\nHowever, there's a possible downside. If the author is rigid and unwilling to make any exceptions, even for something like a family reunion, it might be seen as selfish. But given the long-standing agreement and the fact that the ex is the one who scheduled it during the author's time, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The ex should have checked the custody schedule before planning the trip. The author isn't obligated to give up their time unless both parties agree, and since the ex is not willing to reschedule, the author is within their rights.\n\nAlso, the kids are upset because they think the author is being mean. The author tried to explain the situation, but the kids don't believe them because the ex is making it seem like revenge. The author's reaction is to stick to the agreement, which is fair, but maybe could have handled it more sensitively with the kids. However, the main issue is the ex's bad behavior in this scenario.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is not in the wrong. They followed the custody agreement, didn't give up their time when not necessary, and the ex is the one who scheduled the trip during their time without considering the agreement. The author's actions are justified under the terms they both agreed to. The problem lies with the ex not respecting the terms and manipulating the kids. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
