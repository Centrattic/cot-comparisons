My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person in the story) is in the wrong for not letting their kids go on vacation with their ex during their scheduled time. \n\nFirst, the custody arrangement is 50/50, which they've been following for 8 years. The author has never given up their days before, so this seems like a consistent rule. The ex wants to switch weeks for a family reunion at Disneyland, but the author refuses. The ex is trying to make the kids think the author is being mean by not letting them go. The kids are upset because of this.\n\nThe author's argument is that they're upholding their custody rights. They've always stuck to the schedule, so this isn't a sudden change. The ex is asking for a switch, but the author isn't required to agree unless it's in the kids' best interest. The ex's parents scheduled it during the author's time, which the author sees as the ex's problem to resolve, not theirs.\n\nHowever, maybe the author should consider the kids' feelings. The daughter is crying, and the son is angry. The author might need to explain better or find a compromise, but the situation is complicated by the ex trying to manipulate the kids. The author isn't violating the custody agreement, so technically, they're not in the wrong for sticking to their schedule. The ex should have planned around the custody arrangement or found another time. The author's refusal isn't malicious but about upholding their rights, even if it's causing temporary upset for the kids.\n"
