My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about a parent refusing to switch custody weeks so their kids can go to Disneyland with the other parent during the author's scheduled time. The kids are upset, and the ex is trying to make the author look bad.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the custody agreement. It's a 50/50 split with a set schedule, and they've followed it without switching for 8 years. The ex is asking to switch a week now, but the author is refusing. The ex claims it's important because the parents can only host the reunion that week. The author thinks it's unfair to disrupt their schedule. The children are upset because they think the parent is blocking them from going to Disneyland. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the custody agreement is clear and binding, the parent has the right to their scheduled time unless both parties agree to change it. The ex is trying to unilaterally switch, which the author is not obligated to allow. The author's stance is that they've always followed the agreement strictly, so they're not in the wrong for sticking to it. \n\nEmotionally, the kids are hurt, but the parent's refusal is based on the agreement. However, the parent could have handled the situation better by explaining it to the kids, maybe finding a compromise, or at least involving them in the conversation. But the main issue is whether the ex's request is valid. The ex's parents scheduled it during the author's week, which seems like a choice they made. The author's job is to uphold the custody agreement unless there's a valid reason to change it. Since the ex is the one making the request and the author is refusing, the author isn't in the wrong for protecting their time. The ex might be in the wrong for trying to manipulate the kids into thinking the author is the villain. \n\nSo the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're upholding their custody rights as per the agreement. The ex is the one pushing for a switch without mutual agreement. The kids are caught in the middle, but the fault isn't the author's for following the rules they've both agreed to for years.\n"
