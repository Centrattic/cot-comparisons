My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is about a custody arrangement where both parents have 50/50 time with their kids, switching every other week. The author is refusing to let the kids go on a vacation with their ex during the author's week, leading to the kids being upset and the ex not cooperating.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the custody agreement. They agreed not to plan things on days that aren't theirs and rarely switch weeks unless it's extremely important. The author has never given up their days before. The ex is asking during the author's week for the kids to go to Disneyland hosted by his parents. The author says no, thinking it's their right to have the kids that week. The ex is framing the author as the bad guy, making the kids angry.\n\nSo, the key points here are the custody terms. If they have a 50/50 agreement with strict terms not to switch unless necessary, then the author isn't violating any agreement by not giving up their week. The ex is trying to schedule something during the author's time, which the author isn't required to accommodate. The author's stance is that they're sticking to the agreement, which they've maintained for 8 years without issues before. \n\nThe kids are upset because their ex dad is painting the author as the bad guy. The author is trying to explain, but the kids aren't listening yet. The author's anger is about the ex's manipulation and not respecting the custody agreement. \n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The author is following the custody agreement they agreed upon. The ex is trying to schedule something during the author's time without switching, which the agreement says not to do unless extremely important. The author's refusal isn't unreasonable. The ex is not adhering to the terms by trying to use the author's week without switching. So, the author isn't the one breaking the agreement. \n\nHowever, maybe there's a consideration about the kids' wishes. The kids are older, 16 and 9. The 16-year-old might have a stronger opinion about going to Disneyland. But the custody agreement is supposed to be about the parents' terms. Unless the agreement allows for flexibility, the author isn't obligated to switch. \n\nThe ex's approach of framing the author as the villain is manipulative, which complicates things. The author is standing by their right to the custody time, which they've always upheld. The ex is the one deviating from the agreement by trying to use the author's week without a switch. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
