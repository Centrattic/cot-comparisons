My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not allowing their kids to go on a vacation with the ex during their scheduled time.\n\nFirst, the situation involves a 50/50 custody agreement. The key point here is that both parents agreed to this arrangement, and they've been following it strictly for eight years. The ex is trying to switch weeks for a family reunion at Disneyland, but the author is refusing because it's their scheduled time. \n\nThe ex approached the author about switching weeks, but the author declined. The ex then informed the kids that the author is preventing them from going, which has caused the kids to be upset and angry. The author feels that the ex is trying to manipulate the kids and that the ex is the one at fault for scheduling the trip during the author's time.\n\nNow, considering custody agreements, both parents are supposed to adhere to the established schedule unless they can mutually agree to changes. The author isn't violating the agreement by not switching weeks. The ex is the one who initiated the request, but the author isn't obligated to agree. The ex's parents scheduled the event during the author's time, which complicates things.\n\nThe kids are upset because they perceive the author as the one blocking the trip. However, the author is acting within their rights under the custody agreement. The ex isn't following the agreement by pressing for a switch without the author's consent and is instead using the kids to turn them against the author. \n\nThe author's refusal to give up their scheduled time isn't unjustified since the agreement was mutual. There's no indication that the author is unreasonable in their stance. The ex's actions seem to be more about asserting control or trying to undermine the author, which isn't fair. \n\nIn legal terms, custody agreements are legally binding, and both parties must respect the terms unless there's a court order or mutual agreement to change them. The author isn't in the wrong for upholding their custody schedule. The ex's failure to respect the agreement and the manipulation of the children could be problematic. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong here.\n"
