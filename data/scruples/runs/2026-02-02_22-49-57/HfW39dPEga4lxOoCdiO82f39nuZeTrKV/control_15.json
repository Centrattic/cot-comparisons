My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not allowing their kids to go on vacation with their ex during the writer's custody time.\n\nFirst, the situation is a 50/50 custody agreement established 8 years ago. The key point is that they agreed not to plan things on days that aren't theirs and to avoid switching weeks unless extremely important. The author has strictly followed this, never switching days even when asked. The ex wants to take the kids to Disneyland during the author's week, asking to switch weeks, but the author refuses. The ex is making the kids angry by framing the author as the bad guy for not allowing the trip.\n\nThe author is defending their decision by saying it's their time, and the ex scheduled something on their own without considering. The kids are upset because they don't understand why they can't go, and the ex isn't helping by not correcting them.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is wrong. Let's consider legal and ethical angles. Legally, if the custody agreement is 50/50, each parent has the right to their scheduled time. The ex requested a switch, but the author is within their rights to decline unless it's an emergency. The ex's parents hosted the event, but that doesn't override the custody agreement. The author isn't violating the agreement by not switching. \n\nEthically, the author is prioritizing their time with the kids. The ex is trying to manipulate the kids by making the author look like the villain. The author's refusal isn't about revenge but about upholding the agreed schedule. The kids are young, especially the daughter, and emotional. The son is older and might be more understanding, but the ex's handling of the situation is problematic. \n\nHowever, the author could have considered the kids's feelings more. Explaining the situation with empathy might help them understand. But the author isn't wrong for sticking to the custody terms. The ex is the one initiating the switch without valid reason, and the author's \"tough luck\" response is within their rights. \n\nSo, the answer seems to be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're upholding their custody agreement, and the ex is at fault for not respecting the schedule and manipulating the kids.\n"
