My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a custody arrangement where the author and their ex have a 50/50 split. The ex wants to take the kids to Disneyland during the author's week, so he asks for a switch or the author to give up their time. The author refuses, leading to the kids being upset and the ex not apologizing.\n\nFirst, the custody agreement is supposed to be every other week, and they agreed not to switch unless it's extremely important. The author has never given up their days before, which suggests that this is a firm boundary. The ex is now asking for a switch, but the author is standing by their right to have the kids during their scheduled week. \n\nThe ex's argument is that the family reunion is important, but the author's argument is that the ex scheduled it during their time without considering the custody arrangement. The author is sticking to the agreement they had, which seems like a reasonable approach. However, the kids are suffering emotionally because of this, which is a key point. The author's kids are upset, and the author is being blamed by the ex, which is adding to the conflict.\n\nNow, considering the kids' well-being: while the author has the right to their custody time, the children are clearly distressed. The author tried to explain the situation, but the kids aren't accepting it. The ex is using the kids against the author, which is problematic. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for not giving up their time. \n\nThe custody agreement was meant to ensure both parents have time with the kids. The author is following the agreement as agreed. However, maybe there's a lack of communication or flexibility here. The ex didn't plan the trip with the custody schedule in mind, which could be a mistake. But the author's refusal might be seen as rigid, especially if the kids are really looking forward to the trip. \n\nBut the author's reasoning is that the ex scheduled it during their time, so it's not fair. The ex's parents might not be able to change the dates. The author's right to their custody time is valid, but maybe there's a way to compromise. However, the author has always stuck to the agreement, and the ex is the one initiating the request. The author is within their rights to refuse. \n\nThe main issue is the kids being upset. The author's approach might be causing them emotional distress, but the alternative is the author giving up their time, which they might feel is their right. So, it's a tough call. The author isn't in the wrong for following the custody agreement, but maybe there's a lack of empathy towards the kids' feelings. However, the ex's actions in painting the author as the villain are also problematic. \n\nIn terms of legal rights, the author is correct in maintaining their custody time. The ex's request was outside the agreed terms without a valid reason. The author isn't in the wrong for not switching weeks. The kids' emotional state is a consequence, but the author had to choose between their own time and the kids' happiness. The ex's manipulation of the situation doesn't absolve the author, but the author's stance is legally and based on the agreement, correct. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They are following the custody agreement, and the ex is the one who made the request outside of the terms. The kids' upset is due to the ex's actions and the situation, not the author's. The author isn't the asshole here.\n"
