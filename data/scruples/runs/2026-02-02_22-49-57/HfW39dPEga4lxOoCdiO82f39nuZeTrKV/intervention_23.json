My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting their kids go on a vacation with the ex during their scheduled time. The situation involves a 50/50 custody agreement, and the ex tried to switch weeks for the kids to go to Disneyland with their parents. The author refused, leading to the kids being upset and blaming the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the custody agreement. They agreed to not switch days unless it's extremely important. The ex tried to get a switch, but the author said no. The author isn't giving up their time, which was part of the agreement. The ex's parents scheduled the trip during the author's week, which seems like their responsibility. The ex is trying to make the author look bad to the kids, but the author is standing by the original agreement.\n\nThe kids are upset because they think the author is denying them the trip. However, the author is following the custody schedule. The ex's parents' scheduling might be the issue here. The author isn't violating the agreement by not switching. The kids might not understand the legal arrangement, but the author is within their rights. The ex is the one who's asking for a switch, but the author isn't obligated to agree. \n\nSo, from the facts given, the author isn't in the wrong. The ex is trying to bend the rules, and the author is upholding their end of the custody agreement. The kids are caught in the middle, but the fault lies with the ex for pushing for a switch without a valid reason. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
