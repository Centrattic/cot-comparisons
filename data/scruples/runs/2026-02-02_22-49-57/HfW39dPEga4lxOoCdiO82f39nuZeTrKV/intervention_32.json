My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about custody and a vacation. The author has a 50/50 custody agreement, switching every other week. The ex wants to take the kids to Disneyland during the author's week, but the author refuses. The kids are upset, and the ex is portrayed as trying to paint the author as the bad guy.\n\nFirst, the custody agreement says they don't switch days unless it's extremely important. The author has never switched before, even if the ex asked. The ex's parents have a family reunion at Disneyland, which is during the author's week. The author says no, because it's their time. The ex then tells the kids that the author is blocking them from going, making the kids angry.\n\nSo, the main question is: is the author wrong for not letting the kids go during their scheduled time? The author's reasoning is that the ex scheduled it during their own time and should have planned better. The ex claims it's important and the parents can't reschedule. But the agreement is about not switching unless necessary. The author is sticking to the agreement.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the custody agreement is in place and the ex is trying to take the kids without a switch, the author is within their rights. The ex might be in the wrong for not respecting the agreement. The kids are upset because they were told the author is being unfair, but the author is following the terms they both agreed to. The author isn't trying to get back at the ex, just enforcing the custody arrangement.\n\nThe ex's refusal to reschedule despite the agreement suggests they're the one violating the terms. The author's reaction is about upholding their rights under the agreement. So, the author is not in the wrong here. They're standing by the agreement they both made, and the ex is the one trying to make changes unilaterally.\n"
