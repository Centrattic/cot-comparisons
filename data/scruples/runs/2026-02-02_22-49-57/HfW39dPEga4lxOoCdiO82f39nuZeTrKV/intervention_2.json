My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down the situation here. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post (AITA) is in the wrong. The scenario involves a divorced parent with a 50/50 custody arrangement, and the ex wants to take the kids to Disneyland during the author's scheduled time.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the key points from the post. The author and ex have a custody agreement where they switch every other week. They agreed not to plan things on days that aren't theirs and rarely switch weeks. The author has maintained this agreement strictly for 8 years, never giving up their time unless it's extremely important. Now, the ex is asking to switch a week for a family reunion at Disneyland, but the author refused. The ex is painting the author as the bad guy, causing the kids to be upset.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that the ex scheduled the trip during their time, so they are standing by their agreement. They don't want to give up their time because they feel it's unfair. The kids are mad because they want to go, and the author is being blamed by the ex.\n\nNow, from a legal standpoint, if the custody agreement is clear and the ex is violating it by requesting a switch without a valid reason, the author isn't wrong to enforce their rights. The author isn't bending the rules for the ex, which they've done in the past. The ex's parents scheduled the trip during the author's time, which the ex is now trying to change, but the author isn't obligated to give up their scheduled time unless both agree. \n\nEmotionally, the kids are upset because they want to go, but the author is maintaining their boundaries. The ex isn't helping by badmouthing the author. The author's stance is about upholding the custody agreement, which is a legal right. The ex's actions might be inconsiderate, but the author isn't the one breaking the agreement.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They're adhering to the agreed-upon custody schedule, and the ex is trying to alter it without mutual agreement. The kids' upset is a result of the ex's influence, not the author's actions. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
