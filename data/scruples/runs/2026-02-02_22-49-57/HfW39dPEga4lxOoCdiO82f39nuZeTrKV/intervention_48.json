My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a custody arrangement after a divorce. The parent, the author, has a 50/50 custody schedule and refused to give up their scheduled time with the kids for a family vacation at Disneyland planned by the ex. The kids are upset, thinking the author is the bad guy because the ex told them that they can't go. The author feels it's unfair because the ex scheduled it during their time, and they've never switched weeks before.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. If they have a 50/50 custody agreement that's legally binding, then each parent has the right to their scheduled time. The ex is asking to switch a week, which the author has consistently refused in the past. The ex claims it's important for the family reunion, but the author sees it as the ex's parents' scheduling during their time. Legally, unless there's an emergency or mutual agreement, the parent is within their rights to not switch.\n\nThen there's the emotional impact. The kids are upset because they want to go on vacation with their ex-father. The author is trying to explain it's their time, but the kids are taking the ex's side. The author might feel hurt because their kids are distant now. However, the ex is using the kids as pawns by not telling the truth, which could be emotional manipulation. The author is trying to maintain boundaries, which is important for co-parenting, but the kids are caught in the middle.\n\nThe ex's actions might be problematic here. By not being honest and making the kids believe the author is the villain, the ex is undermining the custody agreement. The author is standing by their legal rights and the agreement they both originally made. The key point is whether the ex's request was reasonable. Since it's a family event during the author's scheduled time, and there's no emergency or mutual agreement, the author's refusal is justified.\n\nAlso, the author has a history of not switching weeks, which the ex is now trying to change. The author's stance is consistent, which is important for the kids' stability. The ex's parents' inability to reschedule doesn't override the custody agreement. So, legally and according to the agreed terms, the author isn't at fault. The ex is trying to manipulate the situation, and the kids are being affected emotionally because of that, but the root issue is the ex's actions, not the author's.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. They are upholding their custody rights, and the ex's actions are the problem here.\n"
