My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a custody arrangement after a divorce, where the author (parent) refused to let their ex take their kids to a family reunion at Disneyland during the parent's scheduled week. The ex and kids are upset, and the kids think the parent is being unfair.\n\nFirst, I need to recall the key points. The custody is 50/50 with strict alternating weeks. Both parents agreed not to plan things on the other's days unless it's extremely important. The ex asked to switch weeks for the Disneyland trip, which the parent refused. The ex then told the kids that the parent is blocking the trip, making the kids upset. The parent feels it's their right to have the kids during their scheduled week.\n\nNow, the question is whether the parent is in the wrong. The parent's stance is that they followed the custody agreement, and the ex scheduled something during their time without valid reason. The ex is trying to switch weeks, but the parent never agrees because it's their time. The kids are upset because they want to go on the trip, but the parent is standing by the custody agreement.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, if the custody arrangement is legally binding and the parent isn't violating it, they're probably not in the wrong. However, the kids are old enough (16 and 9) to feel upset. The 9-year-old is young, but the 16-year-old might have more autonomy in wanting to spend time with the other parent. However, the ex's approach of not getting permission and then framing the parent as the bad guy could be manipulative.\n\nThe parent's refusal to switch is based on the agreed-upon terms. The ex's parents scheduled the trip during the parent's week, so the ex is trying to bend the rules. The parent is maintaining the agreement, which is their right. The ex's actions might be the issue here, not the parent's refusal.\n\nHowever, the kids are feeling punished. The parent could consider their emotional well-being. But the parent also has the right to their scheduled time. The ex's refusal to explain the truth to the kids and instead letting them think the parent is withholding could be problematic. The parent isn't wrong for sticking to the agreement, but maybe could communicate better. But based on the situation, the parent isn't violating the agreement, so they're not in the wrong.\n"
