My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a divorce with 50/50 custody, and the parent (author) is refusing to let the kids go on a vacation with the ex during their scheduled time. The kids are upset, thinking the author is the bad guy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the custody agreement. The author mentions a 50/50 split with no prior switching of weeks unless it's extremely important. The ex wants to switch a week for a family trip, but the author won't agree. The author is standing by the original agreement, which they've both followed for 8 years. The ex is trying to manipulate the kids by making the author look bad. \n\nThe key points here are about the terms of the custody agreement. If the agreement is clear and both have stuck to it, then the author isn't violating anything by not switching. The ex's request is during the author's scheduled time, so the author isn't in the wrong for not giving up their time. The ex is the one deviating from the agreement, trying to reschedule something that's already set. \n\nAlso, the author isn't asking for anything that wasn't agreed upon. The ex's parents scheduled the reunion during the author's week, which is their fault. The author's refusal is based on the existing arrangement. The kids are upset because they don't understand the situation fully, but the author is acting within their rights. \n\nThe ex's behavior seems manipulative here, trying to paint the author as the villain. The author is trying to explain the situation, but the kids aren't listening because the ex has already influenced them. The author isn't doing anything wrong by maintaining the custody schedule as agreed. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B: No, the author isn't in the wrong. They're upholding their right as per the custody agreement, and the ex is the one who's trying to change the terms without agreement.\n"
