My son wont even talk to me and my daughter is crying all the time. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nA little backstory. Me and my ex divorced shortly after my daughter was born. I blame him for it and he blames me. I won't go into detail here. We ended up with a 50/50 custody agreement switching every other week. While this was 8 years ago we're still not on good terms. We rarely ever talk to each other outside of the kids and i'm perfectly fine with that. One thing we have agreed on since the beginning though is that we don't plan things on days that aren't ours. And unless it's extremely important we don't \"switch\" days or weeks. In the 8 years since we've been divorced I have never asked him to have the kids on a day that isn't mine and I've never given him one of my days even if he begged. \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, last week my ex contacted me and told me the \"good\" news. His parents are hosting a week long family reunion in the summer at Disneyland and he want's to take the kids. Well, the problem is that it's on one of my weeks. He asked me to let the kids stay with him that week or to switch a week with me and I shot him down. It's my week with them and I get to spend it with them. I told him if it's so important to him to reschedule but he claims his parents can't do that and this is the only week that the whole family can go and he told me that I need to \"think of them\". I told him \"tough luck\" and hung up on him.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nWell, this last Sunday when my ex dropped the kids off with me my son refused to talk to me at all and my daughter wouldn't even look at me. When I asked my ex what was wrong he refused to talk to me, only saying \"ask them\" in a snarky tone before leaving. When I asked my daughter what was wrong she burst into tears and said that i was \"not letting daddy take them to Disneyland\". Asking my son (who still refuses to talk to me) it turns out that my ex told them I was not letting them go to Disneyland with him. He's trying to paint me as the bad guy. I sat both of them down last night to talk to them and explain it's my week with them but they refused to listen to me. My daughter just cried and my son told me i'm only doing this to get back at my ex.\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm not though. I think its unfair for him to do this when his parents scheduled it during my time with them. I demanded an apology from my ex and him to set things straight but he refuses, and his last text to me being \"can't tell them the truth cause they already know it\". \n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nI'm so pissed right now. Am i the asshole because my ex scheduled something during MY time with MY kids? How is it my fault that i'm only using my right to spend time with them? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a divorced parent and custody. The author has a 50/50 custody arrangement and the kids are upset because the author refused to let them go on a vacation with their ex during the author's week. The ex wants to switch weeks, but the author says no. The kids are taking the ex's side, thinking the author is being selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. The custody agreement is 50/50, and they agreed not to switch days unless extremely important. The author has followed the agreement strictly, never giving up their time before. The ex is asking to switch during the author's week for a family reunion. Legally, if the agreement doesn't allow for switching without mutual agreement, the author isn't in the wrong. But maybe there's more to it. The ex's parents scheduled the reunion during the author's time. Did the ex have a responsibility to check the schedule before making plans? If the ex didn't coordinate properly, maybe that's their fault.\n\nThen there's the emotional aspect. The kids are upset because they feel they can't go to Disneyland. The author's son is mad and the daughter is crying. But the author's stance is about upholding the custody agreement. The author isn't trying to punish the ex but is standing by their rights. The ex is using the kids to get back at the author, which is problematic. The author tried to get an apology from the ex, but the ex refuses and even says they can't tell the kids the truth, implying the author is the bad guy. That's manipulative and harmful to the kids.\n\nThe key points are: 1) The custody agreement is clear, and the author adhered to it. 2) The ex's request to switch was during the author's scheduled time, and the author didn't agree. 3) The ex is manipulating the kids, not the author. 4) The author isn't giving up their time, which they have a right to under the agreement.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're respecting the custody agreement and not allowing the ex to interfere with their time. The ex is the one pushing for a switch without valid reason, and the manipulation of the kids is on their side. The author is protecting their own time with the kids as per the legal agreement. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
