I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author met a girl who initially declined a dinner invite but still saw each other at events. Then, four months later, the girl messages out of the blue to ask for dinner. The author agrees each time, but she cancels every time, four times in total. After the fourth cancellation, the author sends a polite message about valuing their time. She apologizes, mentions her anxiety and issues with relationships. The author is understanding but moves on. Then, last week, she asks to come make dinner at his house. He agrees, but she cancels again, saying she's not comfortable coming alone. He offers to go out instead, but she prefers to stay home. The author then confronts her, saying he's insulted and tells her not to make plans if she can't commit. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are repeated cancellations, the author's response, and the final confrontation. Let's think about both sides.\n\nThe girl has anxiety and trouble forming relationships. That's a valid issue, and people with anxiety might struggle with social plans. However, repeatedly making plans and then canceling can be frustrating for others, especially if it happens multiple times. The author tried to be understanding after the fourth time, but then when it happened again, he felt it was time to set a boundary.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for feeling upset? Well, if someone keeps making commitments they can't keep, it's reasonable to feel taken advantage of. The author was polite initially but eventually had to express his feelings. He didn't lash out; he was direct but said it was about valuing his time. The final confrontation was him setting a boundary after repeated issues. \n\nOn the other hand, the girl has mental health challenges. But if she keeps initiating plans, knowing her anxiety might lead to cancellations, perhaps she should take responsibility for not following through. The author isn't obligated to accommodate her anxiety if it's causing him inconvenience. \n\nThe author isn't being cruel; he's communicating his feelings and setting limits. He tried to be understanding but has a right to his time. So, he's not in the wrong for standing up for himself. The answer should be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
