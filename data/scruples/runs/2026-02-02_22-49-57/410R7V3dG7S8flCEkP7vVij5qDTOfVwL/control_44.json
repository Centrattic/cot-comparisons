I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after confronting a girl who canceled multiple plans because she was nervous. The author tried to be polite but eventually got fed up and told her off. I need to decide if A or B is the right answer.\n\nFirst, I should consider the situation. The girl reached out multiple times, initiated plans, and then canceled each time. The author was patient the first four times, even when the girl apologized and explained her anxiety. But when the fifth attempt happened, the author snapped. \n\nThe key points here are consent and boundaries. The girl kept initiating plans, which implies she's interested in meeting up. However, she cancels each time, possibly due to anxiety. The author's time is being affected, and after repeated cancellations, it's reasonable to feel that their time is being disrespected. \n\nBut wait, the girl has anxiety and is struggling with forming relationships. The author acknowledges this but is upset because the girl keeps initiating. The author's response was to tell her off, which might be seen as valid because they're setting a boundary. However, was the author too harsh?\n\nThe author did try to be understanding initially, gave the girl multiple chances, and only confronted her after several incidents. The final cancellation led to the author expressing frustration, which is a natural reaction if someone is being treated as a last-minute option repeatedly. \n\nOn the other hand, the girl might have a legitimate mental health issue. But she kept initiating plans, knowing her own limitations. The author isn't responsible for fixing her anxiety. It's her responsibility to communicate her needs better. If she can't commit to plans, maybe she shouldn't keep making them. \n\nThe author's main wrongdoing could be in the way they expressed their frustration. However, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong in the situation. The author's frustration is understandable given the repeated cancellations, especially when the girl is the one initiating each time. \n\nSo, the answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they set boundaries after being patient and understanding, and their reaction is a reasonable response to repeated disrespect of their time.\n"
