I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that a girl keeps asking the author out, cancels each time on the day of, and this happens four times. Then the author confronts her, and after another cancellation, he gets fed up and tells her off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girl has anxiety and issues with forming relationships. She's clearly struggling, and she apologizes after the fourth cancellation. The author is a busy person and feels his time is being wasted. He's polite initially but eventually snaps because of the repeated cancellations. \n\nThe key points here are boundaries and mutual respect. The girl keeps initiating plans, which shows she wants to spend time with him, but her anxiety leads to last-minute cancellations. The author, while understanding her situation, has a right to feel frustrated. He tried being polite and gave her multiple chances. When she cancels again, even after knowing his feelings, it's reasonable for him to express his hurt and set boundaries.\n\nIs it wrong for him to feel upset? Probably not. Everyone has limits, and it's okay to prioritize your own time and mental health. The girl might need someone more patient, but the author isn't obligated to work through her problems if it's affecting him negatively. He didn't lash out angrily; he communicated his feelings respectfully after the fourth time. The final cancellation pushed him to set a boundary, which is a healthy response. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. He's standing up for himself while acknowledging her issues. The answer should be B.\n"
