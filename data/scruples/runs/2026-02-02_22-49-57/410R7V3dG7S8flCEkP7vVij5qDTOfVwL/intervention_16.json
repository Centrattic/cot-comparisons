I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a girl who keeps canceling plans with the author, and after multiple times, he confronts her. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The girl initially declined a date, but then reached out 4-5 months later to plan dinner. Each time she made plans, she canceled the day of. The author was polite the first time, even after she apologized. Then, when she proposed another dinner at his house, she canceled again, this time saying she felt uncomfortable coming alone. The author offered alternatives, but she still didn't come. He finally told her he was insulted and that if she can't handle her anxiety, she shouldn't make plans.\n\nSo, the key points here are: repetitive cancellations, the author feeling disrespected, and his response. The girl has anxiety and issues forming relationships, which she explains. The author is a busy person and feels his time is being wasted.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A or B. \n\nIn AITA situations, it's about social norms and expectations. The author tried to be understanding, gave her chances, and eventually set a boundary. The girl isn't showing up despite initiating contact, which can be frustrating. However, his final response was to tell her off, which might be seen as harsh, but considering the frequency, maybe it's justified.\n\nThe author's actions: polite first, then direct when it's repeated. The girl's behavior is inconsiderate, but she has anxiety. The author isn't shunning her or being cruel, just asserting his time. \n\nSocially, it's acceptable to set boundaries, especially when someone repeatedly disregards your time. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling upset and addressing it, especially after multiple instances. He also tried to be understanding. So the answer is B.\n"
