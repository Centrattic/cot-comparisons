I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves someone who kept asking for dinner dates but canceled each time. The author finally had enough and confronted them. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the timeline. The girl contacted the author out of the blue four times, each time making plans and then canceling the same day. The author tried to be understanding, even after the fourth cancellation, sending a polite message. Then, she asked again, and when she canceled again, the author got fed up and told her off.\n\nSo, the key points are: repeated cancellations, the author's attempts to be understanding, and the final confrontation. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants to check.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author is standing up for their own time and feelings. It's reasonable to feel disrespected if someone repeatedly makes plans and backs out. The girl's anxiety might be a valid reason for her actions, but the author has the right to set boundaries. \n\nBut wait, did the author handle it the right way? The first four times, they were patient. After the fourth, they politely addressed it. Then, when she canceled again, they expressed their feelings. That seems fair. The author isn't attacking her but stating their boundaries. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have tried to work with her, but the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Since the author is setting healthy boundaries, not being abusive, and responding after multiple instances, it's more about mutual respect.\n\nSo, answer B: No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
