I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy is getting asked out by this girl multiple times, and each time she cancels on the day of. He ends up getting fed up and confronts her. \n\nFirst, the girl initially turned him down when he asked her out, but then later started initiating contact. She messaged him out of the blue four times, each time making plans which she then canceled the same day. The author was polite the first few times, but after the fourth cancellation, he told her he values his time and doesn't like being treated as disposable. She apologized, explaining her anxiety and relationship issues. He was understanding but then she asked again, and when he tried to adjust plans, he lost it.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. The girl has anxiety, which is a valid issue. People with anxiety might struggle with committing to plans, especially if they're not used to forming relationships. She initiated the plans each time, so she's the one making the effort to reach out. However, repeatedly canceling last-minute could be seen as inconsiderate, even if it's due to anxiety. The author is a busy person and his time is valuable. He tried to accommodate her by suggesting alternatives when she changed her mind again. \n\nBut then he got angry and told her off. Was that justified? Well, he did give her multiple chances and was polite. After she apologized, he still gave her another shot. When she canceled again but with a different reason (not feeling comfortable coming to his house), he tried to adjust by suggesting going out instead. She then said she wanted to stay home, which is part of her anxiety. At that point, he felt disrespected and confronted her. \n\nIs it wrong for him to feel that way? He's not obligated to keep accommodating her if it's causing him stress. It's reasonable to set boundaries. People have the right to expect that if someone makes plans, they'll follow through. However, he did take it personally and got upset. Maybe he should have communicated his feelings without being confrontational, but given the repeated cancellations, his reaction isn't entirely unreasonable. \n\nOn the other hand, the girl might need more understanding. But the author also has needs. The key here is whether he overstepped. He was polite initially, gave her space to explain, and tried to find solutions. When she continued to cancel, his frustration was valid. He's not in the wrong for standing up for himself. So the answer is B, No.\n"
