I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for telling off a girl who kept canceling their dinner plans. The author tried to be polite multiple times but eventually got fed up and confronted her.\n\nFirst, the girl canceled four times. Each time, she initiated the plans, which shows she was interested. But canceling repeatedly, especially on the same day, could be frustrating. The author felt their time was being wasted, which is a valid concern. People do value their time, so getting upset after multiple cancellations makes sense.\n\nThe girl mentioned anxiety and issues forming relationships, which is understandable. However, if she's struggling to commit to plans, maybe she should avoid scheduling them if she's not sure she can attend. The author was patient for four times, gave her the benefit of the doubt, and even tried to accommodate her by suggesting alternative plans (going out instead of her coming over). When she still didn't comply, the author's frustration was justified.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The author communicated their feelings clearly and politely, which is important. They didn't lash out but expressed their need for respect. The girl, on the other hand, kept initiating plans she couldn't keep, which could be seen as inconsiderate, even if anxiety is a factor. The author isn't wrong for setting boundaries after repeated cancellations. It's reasonable to expect that if someone can't commit, they should communicate that up front or avoid making plans altogether. So, the author's reaction seems valid. Answer B.\n"
