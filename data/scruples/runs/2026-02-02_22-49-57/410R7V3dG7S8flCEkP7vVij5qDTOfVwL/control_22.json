I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling off a girl who canceled plans multiple times due to her nervousness.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girl approached the author four times, each time making plans and then canceling the day of. The author initially reacted politely, but after the fourth cancellation, he expressed his frustration. The last time, when she again changed plans, he got fed up and confronted her, saying he was insulted and that she shouldn't make plans if she has anxiety issues.\n\nSo, the key points here are repeated cancellations by the girl, the author's initial patience, and his eventual reaction. The question is about whether the author was wrong to confront her.\n\nOn one hand, the girl has anxiety and is struggling with forming relationships. Her actions might be a result of her mental health issues. The author tried to be understanding initially. However, repeated cancellations could be seen as disrespectful, especially if the author's time is being wasted. The author is entitled to his feelings here. \n\nOn the other hand, the girl initiated all the interactions. She might be in a vulnerable state and using the author as a way to cope with her anxiety. The author's reaction, while understandable, may come off as harsh. However, he did express his feelings calmly and justified his stance based on the repeated cancellations. \n\nThe author isn't trying to hurt her but is asserting his boundaries. It's important to recognize that everyone has different limits. While it's good to be compassionate, there's also a right to self-respect and time management. The author's frustration is valid after multiple instances of being stood up. His response, though firm, seems reasonable given the context. He didn't lash out but communicated his feelings clearly after giving her multiple chances. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. He had the right to express his feelings when his patience was exhausted. The girl's actions were inconsiderate, and the author's response was a boundary-setting measure, which is necessary for mutual respect in any interaction.\n"
