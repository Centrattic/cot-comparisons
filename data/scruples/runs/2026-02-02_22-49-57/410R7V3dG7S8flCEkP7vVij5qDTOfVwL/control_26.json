I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about a girl who kept canceling plans, and the author finally told her off.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the timeline. The girl initially declined a date, then later started initiating plans four times, each time canceling on the day. The author was polite the first few times, but after the fourth cancellation, he sent a polite message about valuing his time. She apologized and mentioned her anxiety. Then, another plan was made where she canceled again, this time not even coming to his house. The author got fed up and told her off, saying he's busy and she shouldn't make plans if she can't commit.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides.\n\nFrom the author's perspective: He's being respectful initially, gives her multiple chances, and communicates his feelings when the pattern repeats. He's a busy person and has the right to his time. The girl kept initiating plans, so she's the one making commitments she can't keep. The author's frustration is understandable, and setting boundaries is important. He didn't lash out; he was polite but firm. \n\nFrom the girl's side: She has anxiety and issues forming relationships. She might be struggling and seeking connection but is unable to follow through. However, repeatedly canceling without considering the other person's time could be seen as inconsiderate, even if it's due to personal issues. \n\nBut here's the thing: the author didn't push her into these plans. She initiated them each time. If she's not able to commit, it's her responsibility to not make plans she can't keep. The author is within his rights to set boundaries. He tried to accommodate her by suggesting alternatives (going out instead of her coming alone), but she still canceled. \n\nThe key points are mutual respect and communication. The author communicated his feelings after repeated cancellations. It's reasonable to expect that if someone can't commit, they shouldn't make plans. The girl's actions might be due to her anxiety, but that doesn't obligate the author to keep waiting. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. He's standing up for himself and valuing his time. The answer should be B.\n"
