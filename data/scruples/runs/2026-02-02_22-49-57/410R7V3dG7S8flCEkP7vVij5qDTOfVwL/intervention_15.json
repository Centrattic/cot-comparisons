I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author met a girl who initially declined a date but they saw each other at events. Then, over four months, she messaged four times to make plans, each time canceling the day of. The fourth time she canceled, the author politely told her they value their time and don't want it wasted. She apologized, mentioned anxiety, and he was understanding. Then last week, she asked to make dinner at his house, which he agreed to. She backed out, saying she wasn't comfortable coming alone, and he offered to go out instead, but she wanted to stay home. That's when he told her he was insulted and that she shouldn't make plans if she has anxiety issues.\n\nFirst, consider communication. The author tried being polite and understanding four times, even after repeated cancellations. He gave her space after the fourth cancellation, and she apologized. Then she tried again, but again canceled. He's a busy person and feels used. Is it wrong to feel that way? Well, people do have boundaries. If someone keeps making plans and canceling, it's reasonable to feel frustrated. The author did set a boundary when he told her he values his time. Then, when she tried again, he adjusted (changing the plan to a different one) but she still canceled. At that point, he's justified in feeling upset. He's not in the wrong for setting boundaries and expressing his feelings, especially after multiple instances. \n\nOn the other hand, the girl has anxiety and relationship issues. The author might be expected to be patient, but there's a limit. If she's initiating and then canceling, she's taking the lead. The author isn't forcing her to do anything. The key here is that he's not being cruel; he's explaining his feelings and setting a boundary. So, the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong). He's within his rights to take his time seriously and not let someone with anxiety issues constantly cancel on him without a conversation.\n"
