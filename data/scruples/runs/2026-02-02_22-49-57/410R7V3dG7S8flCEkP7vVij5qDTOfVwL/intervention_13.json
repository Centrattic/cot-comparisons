I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling off a girl who canceled plans multiple times because she was nervous. The situation is a bit complicated. The girl initiated contact four times, each time for dinner, and canceled each time on the day. The author finally got fed up and confronted her, leading to the situation where he told her off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a right to feel respected and to have his time valued. It's reasonable for someone to get frustrated if someone consistently cancels last-minute, especially after multiple instances. The girl has anxiety and issues forming relationships, which is a valid reason for her behavior. However, even with anxiety, repeatedly making plans and then canceling can come off as disrespectful or inconsiderate.\n\nThe author tried to be polite initially, gave her the benefit of the doubt, and even offered alternatives. His final response was a firm but clear statement about not valuing his time, which is a valid boundary. It's important to respect others' boundaries. The girl might need to address her anxiety, but the author isn't obligated to accommodate her every time without consideration for his own time and feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have been a bit more understanding, but after four cancellations, it's reasonable to set a boundary. The key here is whether the author overstepped or if his reaction was justified. Since he communicated his feelings respectfully and set a boundary, it seems fair. He's not in the wrong for prioritizing his own time and feeling disrespected.\n"
