I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The situation involves someone (let's call them Person A) who kept getting invited by a girl, who then canceled each time. After four times, Person A finally confronts her, and then when she cancels again, they blow up at her. The question is whether Person A is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girl has anxiety and issues forming relationships, which she mentioned. She cancels each time, and maybe she's struggling with her mental health. But Person A is also dealing with their time being wasted multiple times. They tried to be polite and understanding, but after repeated cancellations, they had enough and finally expressed their frustration. \n\nIs it wrong to feel upset when someone cancels plans multiple times? Probably not. It's reasonable to feel disrespected if someone keeps making plans and then backing out. However, the way Person A handled the situation might be a point of contention. They did start by being polite and giving her space, but when they finally confronted her, they were pretty harsh (\"I'm insulted... treat me like a monkey\"). That might come off as too confrontational, especially if the girl is already struggling with anxiety. \n\nOn the other hand, Person A has a right to their time and to set boundaries. They tried to accommodate her different preferences, like going out instead of staying in. The girl kept initiating, so the expectation might have been that she's more committed once she started planning something. But anxiety can be unpredictable, and maybe she's not in a place where she can commit to plans. \n\nSo, is Person A in the wrong? They did express their feelings after multiple instances, which is reasonable. However, the tone might have been too harsh, possibly invalidating her anxiety. But given that it happened four times, maybe Person A had a right to be upset. The key points are whether they overreacted and if they should have been more patient. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether it's reasonable to expect someone to keep making plans if they can't commit. Person A set a boundary, which is okay, but the way they did it might be the issue. However, the girl was the one initiating multiple times, so Person A isn't entirely at fault. So maybe the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong), but there's nuance here.\n"
