I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling off the girl who kept canceling plans. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author met a girl, asked her out, and she declined but they still saw each other. Then, after a few months, she randomly asked him out four times, each time canceling on the day. The author was polite each time but after the fourth cancellation, he sent a message about valuing his time. She apologized and mentioned anxiety. Then another cancellation happened, and the author got fed up and told her off.\n\nSo, the main points here: the girl initiated the plans four times and canceled each time. The author is a busy person and feels his time is being wasted. The girl has anxiety and issues with forming relationships. The author's response was to be polite initially, then set a boundary after repeated cancellations.\n\nNow, considering boundaries and communication. It's important to respect others' feelings, but also, people have the right to set their own boundaries. The author wasn't mean at first, gave her chances, but she kept canceling. After multiple instances, he's justified in feeling upset. He tried to be understanding, but after the fourth time, it's reasonable to express frustration. The girl's anxiety might be a valid reason, but she still made plans she couldn't keep, which affects the other person.\n\nIs the author wrong for setting a boundary? Probably not. People shouldn't have to tolerate being treated disrespectfully. If someone keeps making plans and not showing up, it's reasonable to address it. The author's response was to be polite but clear, which is appropriate. So, the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
