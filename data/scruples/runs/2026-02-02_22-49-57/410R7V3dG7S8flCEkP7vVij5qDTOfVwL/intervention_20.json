I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after confronting a girl who repeatedly canceled plans. The situation has four instances of her canceling, each time initiated by her. The author tried to be polite and even considered her anxiety, but eventually got fed up and told her off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider communication and boundaries. The girl kept making plans and then canceling, which the author found disrespectful. He tried to handle it politely, even after the fourth cancellation. Setting boundaries is important in any relationship, so the author's frustration is understandable. \n\nBut wait, the girl has anxiety and issues with forming relationships. That's a valid reason for her behavior. However, repeatedly making plans and canceling without considering the other person's time could be seen as inconsiderate. The author's response was to express his feelings and set a boundary, which is reasonable. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could have been more understanding and tried to find a middle ground. For example, maybe suggesting smaller, low-pressure interactions. But since the girl kept initiating, the author has the right to feel that his time isn't being respected. \n\nIs he in the wrong? Probably not. He didn't lash out; he communicated his feelings calmly after multiple instances. The key points are that he was polite, tried to be understanding, and eventually set a boundary. So the answer is B, No.\n"
