I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that a girl keeps asking him out for dinner, cancels each time on the day of, and he eventually gets fed up and confronts her. \n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The girl has anxiety and issues forming relationships. She's reaching out to him multiple times, which shows she's interested in some way, but her anxiety is causing her to back out each time. The author is a busy person, and he's clearly frustrated because his time is being wasted repeatedly.\n\nHe mentions that he was polite when he told her off after the fourth cancellation, and she apologized. Then there's another instance where she changes plans again, leading him to confront her more strongly. His main issue is feeling disrespected because she keeps initiating plans but then cancels, making him feel like he's being toyed with.\n\nNow, considering boundaries. It's important for people to respect each other's time. If someone is constantly making plans and canceling last minute, it's reasonable for the other person to feel upset. The author isn't being hostile, just setting a boundary. He tried to be understanding and even suggested alternatives when she canceled again. \n\nOn the other hand, the girl has anxiety, which is a real issue. But even with anxiety, she's the one initiating the plans each time. Maybe she's not realizing the impact of her actions. However, it's also important for her to communicate her needs better. \n\nThe author isn't attacking her for her anxiety; he's expressing that he can't keep accommodating last-minute cancellations. He's standing up for himself, which is a healthy thing to do. People have the right to set boundaries, especially regarding their time and emotional well-being.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Probably not. He's being upfront about his feelings and setting limits. The girl might need to either commit to plans or not initiate them if she's not able to follow through. The author's reaction is a reasonable response after multiple instances of being stood up.\n"
