I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a girl who keeps asking the author out to dinner, then canceling the day of each time. After four times, the author confronts her politely about wasting their time. The girl apologizes and explains her anxiety. Then she asks to make dinner at his house, and when he offers to meet out instead, she says she's introverted and wants to stay home. The author then gets fed up and tells her off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that they're being respectful but also have their own time to consider. They've given the girl multiple chances, and after repeated cancellations, they feel justified in expressing their frustration. The girl, on the other hand, has anxiety and is struggling with forming relationships, which might explain her behavior.\n\nThe key points here are boundaries and communication. The author set a boundary after four cancellations by politely addressing the issue. The girl apologized and explained her issues, but then continues to make plans she cancels on. The author's frustration is understandable, especially if they're a busy person. It's important to respect one's own time and not let others take advantage of that.\n\nHowever, the author did try to be understanding and offered alternatives when the girl changed her mind. The girl, though, kept initiating plans, which implies she expected the author to be okay with her cancellations. The author's final response was direct but not hostile, just expressing their feelings and setting a boundary. \n\nIn relationships, mutual respect is key. The author isn't in the wrong for protecting their time and expressing their feelings when boundaries are crossed. The girl's actions kept putting the author in a position where their time wasn't respected, so the author is justified in their reaction. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
