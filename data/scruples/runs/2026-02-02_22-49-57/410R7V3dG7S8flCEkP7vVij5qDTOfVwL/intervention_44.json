I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a girl who repeatedly cancels plans with the author after initially showing interest. The author eventually confronts her, and then when it happens again, he tells her off. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is approached multiple times by the girl, each time she initiates a plan, but cancels last minute. He responds politely the first few times, but after the fourth cancellation, he sends a polite message about valuing his time. Then, when she cancels again, he gets fed up and confronts her, saying she's treating him like a monkey. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong but wants to confirm.\n\nSo, from the author's perspective, he's being respectful and understanding initially. He allows her to cancel without holding it against her, even after her apology and explanation about anxiety. But after repeated cancellations, he's justified in feeling frustrated. People have the right to set boundaries, especially when their time is being disrespected. It's reasonable for him to feel upset if someone keeps making plans and then canceling, especially since he's busy. The girl's actions could be seen as inconsiderate, even if it's due to anxiety. The author isn't attacking her for her anxiety but is standing up for his own time and not tolerating the pattern.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author should be more patient and accommodating, given her anxiety. However, it's important to balance understanding with self-respect. The author didn't escalate into being rude; he communicated his feelings respectfully. The key here is that the girl initiated all the plans, so she's the one making demands, and the author is within his rights to say no if the pattern continues. \n\nThe final decision hinges on whether repeated cancellations without proper notice are acceptable. Since she canceled each time on the day of, it's understandable that the author is frustrated. He gave her the benefit of the doubt multiple times, but after four instances, it's reasonable to set a boundary. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because he's asserting his own needs without being unkind.\n"
