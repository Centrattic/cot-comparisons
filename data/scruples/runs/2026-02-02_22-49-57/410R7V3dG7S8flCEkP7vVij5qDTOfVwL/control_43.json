I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling off the girl who canceled plans four times due to nervousness or anxiety.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and the girl met, she initially turned down a date but saw each other at events. Then, she messaged him four times to make plans, each time canceling on the day. After the fourth time, the author told her politely that he values his time. She apologized, mentioned her anxiety. Then she tried again, and he agreed, but she canceled again. The author then confronted her, saying he's fed up and that she shouldn't make plans if she has issues.\n\nSo the main points: repeated cancellations, author's frustration is valid because of his time, but he's also trying to be understanding. The question is whether he's in the wrong for getting upset and confronting her.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the girl has anxiety and is struggling with forming relationships. It's not easy for her to reach out, and she might be doing her best. But the author is also a human being with his own time and feelings. Repeatedly being stood up can be frustrating and disrespectful, even if the reasons are valid. The author did try to be polite before, but after multiple instances, it's reasonable to set boundaries.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's reaction was justified. He didn't lash out, but he was honest about his feelings. He gave her chances, and she kept canceling. The final confrontation was in response to another cancellation. It's about mutual respect. While the girl's anxiety is a valid issue, it's also about communication and considering the other person's time and feelings.\n\nThe author isn't being cruel; he's asserting his need for respect. It's okay to feel upset when someone keeps leading you on, especially when they know about the cancellations. The girl should take responsibility for her actions, but the author isn't in the wrong for expressing his frustration.\n"
