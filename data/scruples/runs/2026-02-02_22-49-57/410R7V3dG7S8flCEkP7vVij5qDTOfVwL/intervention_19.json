I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling off a girl who kept canceling plans. The situation is that the girl initiated contact four times, each time making plans and then canceling the day of. The author finally got fed up and told her off, saying they value their time and don't want to be treated like she can waste it. The girl apologized and mentioned anxiety, but the author still felt upset and confronted her again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider boundaries. The author is within their right to express their feelings when someone repeatedly cancels. It's reasonable to want consistency and respect in plans, especially if it's affecting their time. The girl initiated the plans, so she's the one making the commitments, which adds to the expectation that she should follow through. \n\nOn the other hand, the girl has anxiety and mentioned relationship issues. That's a valid struggle, but the author might have considered being more patient or suggesting alternative ways to engage that might be less stressful for her. However, after multiple cancellations, the author's frustration is understandable. People can't be expected to accommodate someone's anxiety indefinitely without setting boundaries. \n\nThe author handled it politely the first time, giving the girl the benefit of the doubt. Then, when it happened again, they stood their ground. It's important to balance empathy with self-respect. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries, especially since they tried to be understanding first. The girl's actions were inconsiderate, so the author's response is justified. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
