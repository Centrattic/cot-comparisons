I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after telling off a girl who canceled plans multiple times due to her nervousness and anxiety.\n\nFirst, the author tried to be understanding. They met the girl, she declined an initial date but they kept seeing each other at events. Then, she randomly asked for dinner four times, each time canceling on the day. The author was polite the first time they confronted her, acknowledged her anxiety, and let it go. But when she asked again and canceled again, the author felt fed up and told her off, saying they were insulted by her repeated cancellations.\n\nNow, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the girl has anxiety and relationship issues, which is a valid struggle. She initiated the plans each time, which shows she was interested but couldn't follow through, possibly due to her mental health. The author might feel their time is being wasted, especially since they're busy.\n\nBut the author also gave her multiple chances. After the fourth cancellation, they communicated their feelings politely. The last time, the girl changed her plans again, leading the author to snap. The key here is whether the author overstepped by being harsh. The author's response was to tell her off, which might come off as dismissive of her anxiety, even if they tried to be understanding before.\n\nHowever, the author has a right to feel their time is valuable. If someone repeatedly makes plans they can't keep, it's reasonable to set boundaries. The girl's actions might be perceived as inconsiderate, even if it's due to anxiety. The author didn't immediately cut her off but gave her multiple chances. The final outburst was likely a result of accumulated frustration, which is understandable.\n\nBut maybe the author could have handled it with more patience, considering her mental health. However, the girl kept initiating plans, which implies she was okay with making commitments she couldn't keep. The author's right to be upset is valid, but the way they expressed it might have been harsh. However, they did try to be polite before.\n\nIn the end, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They communicated their feelings, especially after multiple instances. The girl's actions were inconsiderate, and the author had a right to set boundaries. The answer is B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
