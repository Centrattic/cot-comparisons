I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for telling off a girl who kept canceling plans. The situation involves multiple instances of the girl initiating plans and then canceling last-minute, which led the author to feel disrespected and eventually confront her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girl approached the author multiple times, each time making plans and then canceling. The author was polite initially but eventually expressed frustration about valuing their time. The girl apologized and mentioned her anxiety and issues with forming relationships. The author tried to accommodate her by suggesting alternatives, but the last cancellation led to the author confronting her about being treated like a \"monkey on a string.\"\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's analyze both perspectives.\n\nFrom the author's viewpoint, they've been patient and understanding, trying to work around the girl's anxiety. However, repeated cancellations without notice can be frustrating, especially for someone who is busy. The author's response was to set boundaries, which is reasonable. People have the right to communicate their feelings when they're being disrespected, even if the other person has issues. The author did address it politely first, then escalated after multiple incidents, which could be seen as justified.\n\nOn the other hand, the girl has anxiety and may be struggling with forming relationships. It's important to be empathetic towards mental health issues. However, it's also about mutual respect in a relationship. If she's consistently unable to commit to plans she initiates, it's fair for the author to express that it's not working for them. The author isn't dismissing her issues entirely; they acknowledged her anxiety but set a boundary.\n\nThe critical factor here is whether the author overstepped. The author didn't attack the girl's character but instead expressed their feelings and boundaries. The girl's actions (multiple cancellations) led to the author's frustration. The author's response was a reaction to ongoing behavior that wasn't respecting the author's time. Setting boundaries is a healthy part of any relationship, so the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for doing that.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions were a reasonable response to repeated disrespectful behavior, even though they tried to be understanding. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
