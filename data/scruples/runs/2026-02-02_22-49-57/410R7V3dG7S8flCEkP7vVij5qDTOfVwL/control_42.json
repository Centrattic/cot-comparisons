I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this story is in the wrong. The situation involves a girl canceling plans multiple times, and the author finally getting fed up and confronting her.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The girl initiates contact four times, each time making plans which she cancels the same day. The author is polite the first time but eventually loses patience after the fourth cancellation. He tells her off for wasting his time, especially since he's busy. The key points here are mutual respect, communication, and boundaries.\n\nThe girl has anxiety and trouble forming relationships, which she mentions after the fourth cancellation. The author says he understands but seems to feel that she shouldn't make plans if she's going to cancel. Is it reasonable for the author to expect her to not cancel if she's not sure? Or is the girl also trying to work through her anxiety by reaching out?\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he's being respectful initially but has limits. He's a busy person and values his time. After four instances, it's reasonable to feel frustrated. However, he did give her the benefit of the doubt each time. The issue is whether it's his responsibility to help her overcome her anxiety or if she should take accountability for her actions.\n\nThe author's response after the fourth time\u2014being polite but firm about valuing his time\u2014seems fair. He's not attacking her but setting boundaries. The final confrontation, while maybe harsh in tone (\"monkey who can dance whenever she wants\"), is a reaction to repeated cancellations. The question is whether his reaction is justified or if he should be more accommodating.\n\nOn the other hand, the girl might need support, but the author isn't a therapist. He's under no obligation to continually accommodate her cancellations without some reciprocity. The fact that she initiated all the plans and then canceled might mean she's not respecting his time as much as she should. The author's frustration is valid because repeated cancellations without consideration can be seen as disrespectful.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. He's allowed to feel upset and express that respectfully. The girl is responsible for her anxiety, but the author isn't obligated to tolerate repeated disrespect. So the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
