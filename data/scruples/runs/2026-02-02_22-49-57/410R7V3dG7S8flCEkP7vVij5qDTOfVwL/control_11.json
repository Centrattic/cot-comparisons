I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author had multiple instances where a girl he's been talking to canceled their plans four times in a row. Each time, she initiated the plans but then canceled, and after the fourth time, he told her off. Now, he's wondering if he was wrong to feel upset and react that way.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girl initially turned down his date invite but they still saw each other at events. Then she messaged him out of the blue four times to make plans, each time canceling on the day. The author was polite the first few times, but after the fourth cancellation, he sent a message about valuing his time. She apologized and mentioned her anxiety. The last time, she wanted to come to his house but canceled again, and he got fed up, telling her off.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The author had a right to feel frustrated. People have the right to set boundaries, especially when their time is being consistently disrespected. The girl's actions were causing repeated inconvenience, and the author tried to be understanding. But after multiple cancellations, it's reasonable for him to express his feelings. His reaction was a form of self-respect, not being passive-aggressive or hostile. He was polite in his communication.\n\nOn the other hand, the girl had anxiety issues, which might explain her cancellations. However, if she's not in a place to commit to plans, maybe she shouldn't keep making them. The author isn't obligated to constantly accommodate someone else's anxiety without reciprocity. It's a balance between empathy and self-respect. The author's response was a reasonable boundary-setting, so he's not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
