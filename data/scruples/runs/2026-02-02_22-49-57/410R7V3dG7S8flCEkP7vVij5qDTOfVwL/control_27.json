I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling off a girl who canceled plans multiple times due to her nervousness and anxiety. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The girl initially rejected a date but kept interacting. Then, she messaged four times to make plans, each time canceling on the day. The author tried being polite, even after the fourth cancellation, but finally got fed up and confronted her.\n\nThe main points here are about boundaries and mutual respect. The author values their time and felt disrespected by repeated cancellations. The girl has anxiety and relationship issues, which explains her actions but doesn't excuse the pattern of behavior. \n\nThe author's response was to express their feelings and set a boundary. It's important to consider if the author overreacted or if they had a right to be upset. Since the girl kept initiating plans despite her anxiety, maybe she should have been more considerate of the author's time. On the other hand, the author could have communicated their feelings earlier instead of letting it build up.\n\nBut looking at it, the author tried to be understanding each time. After four cancellations, it's reasonable to feel frustrated. The final conversation where the author sets boundaries seems justified. They didn't lash out, just expressed their feelings. The girl's actions were inconsiderate, so the author isn't wrong for addressing it. \n\nSo the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong. They had a right to set boundaries after repeated disrespect for their time.\n"
