I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about someone who kept being canceled on by a girl multiple times, and then finally confronting her. The author is asking if they're the a**hole (AITA) for telling her off.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The guy asked the girl out, she declined, but they saw each other at functions. Then four months later, she reached out for dinner four times, each time canceling on the day. After the fourth time, he texted her about valuing his time. She apologized and mentioned her anxiety. Then she asked again, and even when he offered alternatives, she still canceled again. The guy then told her off, feeling insulted and fed up.\n\nSo, the question is whether the guy is in the wrong. From an outsider's perspective, the guy's reactions are understandable. He's a busy person, and being canceled four times by someone who keeps initiating plans is frustrating. He did give her chances each time, even offered alternatives when she said she didn't feel comfortable. When she couldn't commit to any plan, his frustration is reasonable. He also tried to be polite and understanding initially, but after multiple instances, it's okay to set boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, the girl has anxiety and issues forming relationships. She did apologize and explain her situation. But she kept initiating contact, knowing she might cancel. That's where the problem is. She's not respecting his time, even after he's expressed his feelings. The guy had a right to feel disrespected and to confront her about it. It's not about being unsympathetic, but about mutual respect. If she can't form plans consistently, she shouldn't keep making plans she can't keep.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. He tried to be understanding, but after repeated behavior that disregards his time, he's justified in standing up for himself. The answer should be B, No.\n"
