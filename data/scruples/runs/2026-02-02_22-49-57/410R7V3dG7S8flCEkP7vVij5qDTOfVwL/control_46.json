I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling off the girl who kept canceling plans due to nervousness and anxiety.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girl asked him out four times, each time he agreed, but she canceled the day of. He sent a polite message after the fourth time, and she apologized, explaining her anxiety. Then she tried again, but he ended up getting fed up and confronting her.\n\nSo, the key points here are: she initiated the plans multiple times, he respected her decisions each time, and after repeated cancellations, he finally expressed his frustration. He didn't push her or pressure her beyond what she was comfortable with. He tried to accommodate her by suggesting going out instead of her coming to his house, but she still backed out.\n\nNow, considering if he's in the wrong. He had a right to feel his time was being wasted, especially since she kept initiating contact. It's reasonable to expect some consistency if someone is making plans. He did give her chances and tried to be understanding. His final response was about setting boundaries, which is valid. People have the right to set limits, especially when their time and feelings are being affected. \n\nOn the other hand, the girl has anxiety, which is a valid reason for her cancellations. But if she's not in a place where she can commit to plans, maybe she shouldn't keep initiating them. However, he did try to adjust by suggesting alternatives. \n\nThe question is whether his reaction was justified. He wasn't abusive or dismissive; he was polite initially and then set a boundary when it became too much. The girl's pattern of behavior was the issue here. He's not the one who's inconsiderate. So, he's not in the wrong for standing up for himself. Answer B.\n"
