I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling off a girl who canceled plans multiple times due to her anxiety. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the girl approached the author several times, each time making plans and then canceling on the day. The author was polite the first time, but after four cancellations, they confronted her. The last time, she wanted to come over but changed her mind, leading the author to express their frustration.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The girl has anxiety and issues with forming relationships, which she communicated. The author is a busy person and feels their time is being wasted. They had a right to feel upset after repeated no-shows. The author's response was to set a boundary, which is reasonable. They tried to accommodate her by suggesting alternatives, but she still didn't show. \n\nBut maybe the author could have been more patient? However, the girl was the one initiating, so expecting the author to keep accommodating without any reciprocation might be unfair. The author's right to their time is valid. The key here is mutual respect. If someone keeps making plans and then bailing, it's reasonable to address it. The author's reaction wasn't hostile, just setting a boundary. So the answer would be B, not in the wrong.\n"
