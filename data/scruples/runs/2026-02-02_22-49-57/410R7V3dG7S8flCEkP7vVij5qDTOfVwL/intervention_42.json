I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a girl who repeatedly asked him out, then canceled each time. He told her off after four cancellations. The question is whether he's wrong for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the events. The guy asked her out once, she declined but they saw each other at functions. Then, she messaged him four times, each time asking to meet up, and canceled the day of. He finally told her off, saying he values his time and can't be treated as disposable. She apologized and mentioned her anxiety. The last time, she wanted to come to his house but then backed out again, leading him to get fed up and confront her.\n\nSo, the key points here are: she initiated contact four times, he was patient each time, and after multiple cancellations, he expressed his frustration. He also tried to accommodate her by suggesting going out instead, but she still backed out. The user's friend (the author) is asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. She has anxiety and issues with forming relationships. He's busy and feels his time is being wasted. He was polite initially, but after repeated no-shows, it's reasonable for him to set boundaries. People with anxiety might have trouble committing to plans, and it's not fair to expect someone else to endlessly wait for them. The author isn't being cruel; he's stating his boundaries, which is healthy. On the other hand, he did confront her after four times, which is a lot, so maybe some could argue he should have been more understanding. But given that she kept initiating and then backing out, it's not entirely his fault. He's not in the wrong for standing up for himself. So the answer is B.\n"
