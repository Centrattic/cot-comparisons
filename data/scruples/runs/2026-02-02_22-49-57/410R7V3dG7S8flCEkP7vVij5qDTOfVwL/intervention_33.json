I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after confronting a girl who canceled their plans multiple times due to her nervousness and anxiety. \n\nFirst, the girl initiated four separate dinner plans, each time canceling the day of. The author was polite initially, but after the fourth time, he expressed that he values his time and doesn't appreciate being treated as disposable. The girl apologized, explaining her anxiety and issues with relationships. The author was understanding but set a boundary. Then, when the girl proposed another plan, she again backed out, leading the author to confront her more strongly.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the girl repeatedly made plans she couldn't keep, the author communicated his feelings clearly and politely, and he set boundaries. The author's main issue is feeling disrespected due to the repeated cancellations, especially since he's busy. The girl's reasons are valid (anxiety), but she kept initiating plans she couldn't follow through on. \n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong to be upset and to set those boundaries. From a communication and respect standpoint, the author had the right to express his feelings. It's reasonable to expect that if someone is too anxious to commit to plans, they shouldn't make them in the first place. The author wasn't being cruel; he was firm but polite, and it's okay to prioritize one's own time, especially when repeatedly let down. The girl's actions did come across as disrespectful, so the author's response is understandable and justified. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
