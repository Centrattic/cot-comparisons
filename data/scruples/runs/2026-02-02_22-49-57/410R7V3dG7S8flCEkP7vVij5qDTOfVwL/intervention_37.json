I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for confronting the girl who kept canceling plans. \n\nFirst, the girl asked him out four times, each time canceling the day of. He initially responded politely, even after the first four cancellations. After the fourth, he sent a polite message about valuing his time. She apologized and mentioned her anxiety. Then, she asked to come over again, and he agreed. She canceled again, this time because she didn't feel comfortable coming to his house. He offered alternatives, but she still didn't show up. Finally, he got fed up and told her to not make plans if she can't follow through.\n\nThe key points here are his boundaries and her repeated cancellations. He tried to be understanding, but after several instances, it's reasonable to set boundaries. The question is whether his reaction was justified. \n\nHe's a busy person and his time is valuable. She kept initiating contact despite her anxiety, which might be part of her personal issues. However, he's not obligated to accommodate her every time she changes her mind. His final response was direct but not necessarily hostile. He didn't lash out, just communicated his feelings clearly.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue he should be more patient and accommodating, but considering the pattern, it's also valid to prioritize his own time and emotional energy. So, the author isn't in the wrong for setting those boundaries. Answer B.\n"
