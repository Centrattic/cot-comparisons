I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author kept getting plans canceled by this girl multiple times, and finally told her off. The author is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girl initiated contact four times, each time making plans and then canceling the same day. The author was polite at first, but after four times, they expressed frustration. The last time, she wanted to come to his house but then canceled again, leading him to confront her.\n\nSo, from the author's perspective, they're respecting their time and setting boundaries. It's reasonable to feel upset when someone repeatedly cancels. The girl has anxiety and issues forming relationships, which she admits. But does that justify repeated cancellations without better communication?\n\nThe author's response was to tell her off. Was that appropriate? They were polite and gave her space to apologize before. The final time, they expressed being insulted, which might come off as harsh. Maybe there's a better way to handle it, but given the repetition, it's understandable to feel fed up.\n\nThe girl's responsibility is to communicate better and not make plans she can't keep. The author is not obligated to keep accommodating. So the author isn't in the wrong for standing up for themselves. They tried to be understanding, but after multiple instances, it's okay to set boundaries.\n\nSo the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They had valid reasons and tried to be patient before addressing the issue.\n"
