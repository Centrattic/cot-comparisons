I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author met a girl who initially wasn't interested in a date but they still saw each other at events. Then, four months later, she randomly asked for dinner four times, each time canceling on the day. After the fourth time, the author politely told her that they value their time and didn't appreciate her wasting it. She apologized, explaining anxiety and relationship issues. The author was understanding. Then, another time, she wanted to come over for dinner, but then changed her mind, preferring to stay home. The author got fed up and confronted her, saying they were insulted and that she shouldn't make plans if she can't commit. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Let's break this down. The key points are the repeated cancellations, the author's reaction, and the girl's reasons (anxiety). The author is asking if they were right to confront her or if they should be more understanding.\n\nFirst, the girl's actions: she initiated contact four times, each time with the same outcome. That's four instances of making plans and then canceling last minute. The author is busy and clearly frustrated. The girl's excuses are anxiety and past trauma. It's understandable that someone with anxiety might struggle with forming relationships, but repeatedly canceling plans without much notice can be seen as disrespectful, even unintentionally.\n\nThe author's response after the fourth time was polite, mentioning valuing their time. That seems reasonable. Then, when the girl tried again, leading to another cancellation, the author's frustration boiled over. They told her they were insulted and that she shouldn't make plans if she can't follow through. \n\nIs that justified? Well, everyone has limits. The author is within their right to set boundaries. They tried to be understanding, given the girl's reasons, but after multiple instances, it's reasonable to feel that the girl isn't respecting their time. The author isn't in the wrong for expressing their frustration, especially since the girl was the one initiating the plans each time. \n\nHowever, maybe the author could have approached it differently, like suggesting alternative arrangements if the girl was uncomfortable. But the author did offer alternatives (going out instead of her coming over), and she still backed out. So their frustration is valid. They have a right to their feelings and time. \n\nOn the other hand, the girl has anxiety, which is a legitimate issue. But that doesn't mean she should keep making plans she can't keep. The author's responsibility isn't to \"fix\" her anxiety but to set boundaries. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They handled the situation with patience initially and then set a boundary when their frustration was justified. Therefore, answer B (No) is correct.\n"
