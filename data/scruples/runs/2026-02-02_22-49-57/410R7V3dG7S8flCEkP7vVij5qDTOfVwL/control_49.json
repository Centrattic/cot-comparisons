I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a girl who keeps asking someone out for dinner, then canceling last minute four times. The author finally snaps and tells her off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girl initiated contact multiple times, leading the author to believe she was interested. Each time, she canceled, which might be due to anxiety or relationship issues. The author tried to be understanding initially but eventually felt disrespected and set boundaries.\n\nIs the author wrong for feeling upset? Well, people have the right to expect some level of consideration when making plans. Repeated cancellations without prior communication can be frustrating. The author did try to be polite and give her the benefit of the doubt, especially after the fourth cancellation, when he expressed his feelings calmly.\n\nOn the other hand, the girl has mental health issues, which can affect her ability to commit to plans. The author might not be in the wrong for setting boundaries, especially after multiple instances of being stood up. It's also important to note that the author didn't confront her aggressively but tried to be respectful while expressing his feelings.\n\nThe question is whether the author overreacted. Since the girl was the one consistently initiating the plans, the author might have a right to feel misled or disrespected. However, the author could have handled it more gracefully, perhaps by not engaging further after the first few cancellations. But the final interaction where he told her off after she canceled again might be seen as a reasonable boundary.\n\nIn terms of mental health, the author could have offered support, but that's not his responsibility. He's under no obligation to work through her issues. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for prioritizing his own time and feelings.\n"
