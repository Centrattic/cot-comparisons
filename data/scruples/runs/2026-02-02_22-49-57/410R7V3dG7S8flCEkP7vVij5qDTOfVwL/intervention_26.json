I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves someone who keeps asking for dinner dates and then canceling each time. The author eventually gets fed up and tells off the girl.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The girl has anxiety and issues with forming relationships. She's the one initiating the plans, which might mean she's trying to reach out despite her fears. But the author is a busy person and feels his time is being wasted. After multiple cancellations, he's justified in feeling frustrated.\n\nThe key points here are communication and boundaries. The author tried to be polite and understanding each time the girl canceled. He even accepted her apology after the fourth time. But when she cancels again, he's at his limit. It's important to consider if he crossed a line in his response. He told her he was insulted and that if she has problems, she shouldn't make plans. That might come off as harsh, but he was clear and had given her multiple chances.\n\nOn the other hand, the girl might have genuine issues, but she kept initiating plans she couldn't honor. Maybe she didn't consider how it affects the other person. But she did apologize and explain her anxiety. The author's final response was to set a boundary, which is reasonable after repeated no-shows.\n\nSo, the question is whether his reaction was appropriate. He was polite initially, gave her chances, and only after four cancellations stood his ground. It's about mutual respect. The author isn't in the wrong because he's asserting his own needs and time, especially since he's a busy person. The girl should take responsibility for her actions and communicate better if she's going to keep canceling. The author's frustration is valid, and setting boundaries isn't being in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B.\n"
