I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for telling off a girl who canceled plans multiple times because of her nervousness or anxiety. \n\nFirst, the author met a girl, asked her out, and she declined. Then, about four months later, she randomly asked to go to dinner. The author agreed, but she canceled the day of. This happened four times total. The fourth time, the author sent a polite message about valuing their time. The girl apologized, mentioned anxiety and relationship issues. The author was understanding. Then, the girl called again, suggested making dinner at the author's house. The author agreed, but she canceled again, saying she wasn't comfortable going alone. The author offered to go out instead, but she wanted to stay home. The author got fed up and told her off, saying he's insulted and that if she can't handle plans, she shouldn't make them.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides.\n\nFrom the author's perspective: He's been respectful each time she cancels. Even after four cancellations, he's polite and gives her the benefit of the doubt. He even suggests alternatives when she cancels. His frustration is justified because he's a busy person and values his time. It's reasonable to feel upset when someone repeatedly makes plans and then backs out, especially when they're the ones initiating contact. The author isn't being cruel; he's setting boundaries after repeated disrespect to his time.\n\nFrom the girl's perspective: She has anxiety and issues forming relationships. She might be struggling with social interactions and is reaching out because she wants to connect but can't follow through. She apologized after the fourth cancellation, showing she realizes there's a problem. However, continuing to make plans she cancels again shows she might not be taking responsibility or finding solutions. Her anxiety is real, but she's using it as a reason to keep canceling without resolving the underlying issues.\n\nThe key points are communication, boundaries, and mutual respect. The author tried being understanding and accommodating. The girl's repeated cancellations without addressing her issues could be seen as inconsiderate. The author is within his rights to express his frustration and set boundaries. It's not wrong to prioritize your time and mental well-being. Even though he initially tried to be understanding, after multiple instances, it's reasonable to voice his concerns.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Some might say the author should be more patient, but that's assuming he's obligated to accommodate her without any reciprocation. Relationships require mutual effort. If she's not working on her anxiety or finding ways to be consistent, the author isn't at fault for stepping back.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. He's standing up for his time and setting boundaries after repeated disrespect. The girl needs to take responsibility for her actions, but the author's reaction is justified.\n"
