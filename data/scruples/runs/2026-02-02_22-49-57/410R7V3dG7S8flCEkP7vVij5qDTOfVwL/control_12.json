I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that this girl kept asking him out, but each time canceled last minute. The author got fed up and told her off. The question is whether he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girl has anxiety and issues forming relationships, which she mentioned. That's a valid reason for her behavior. But then again, the author is a busy person and his time is important. He's being respectful by trying to accommodate her, but she's not showing up. That's frustrating.\n\nThe key points here are communication and boundaries. The author was polite when he first told her he values his time. After her apology, he let it go. But when she kept doing it, he had to set a boundary. It's important to respect someone's mental health, but also, it's okay to protect your own time and not be taken advantage of. \n\nThe girl initiated all the plans, so she's the one making the commitment. Canceling repeatedly without a valid reason (even if it's anxiety) is still a breach of trust. The author had to communicate his feelings, especially after multiple instances. He didn't lash out, just expressed his frustration and set a boundary. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have been more patient? But considering he's been through four cancellations, it's reasonable to feel upset. He's not saying he won't help her, just that he's done with being treated this way. \n\nMental health is a big factor here, but the author isn't dismissing her issues. He acknowledges her anxiety but also asserts his own needs. Balancing empathy with self-respect is important. In relationships, both people need to show up. If she can't commit because of anxiety, maybe she's not ready for a relationship. \n\nSo, the author isn't wrong for feeling hurt and setting a boundary. He's not being cruel, just honest. The answer is probably B\u2014No, he's not in the wrong.\n"
