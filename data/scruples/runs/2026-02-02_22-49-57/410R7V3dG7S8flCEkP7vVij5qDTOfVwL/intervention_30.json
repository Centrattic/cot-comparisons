I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling off a girl who canceled plans multiple times due to nervousness. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girl approached the author four times, each time making plans and then canceling the day of. The author gave her the benefit of the doubt initially, even when she canceled the first few times. After the fourth cancellation, the author politely expressed that they value their time. The girl apologized and mentioned her anxiety.\n\nThen, in the most recent instance, the girl wanted to come over, but then changed her mind. The author offered alternatives, but she still wanted to stay home. The author then told her they were insulted and that if she has anxiety, she shouldn't make plans. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to feel disrespected if someone keeps making plans and canceling last minute. It's reasonable to expect that if someone agrees to a plan, they should follow through unless there's a valid reason. The author tried to be understanding, even after multiple cancellations, which shows a level of patience.\n\nOn the other hand, the girl has anxiety and relationship issues, which might make it hard for her to commit to plans. She did initiate the conversations, so maybe she's trying to build up to a relationship but struggles with anxiety. The author's response might come off as harsh, especially since he's a busy person and the girl is the one reaching out. However, the author also tried to accommodate her by offering to go out instead of her coming alone.\n\nThe key points here are communication and boundaries. The author did communicate his feelings after multiple cancellations, which is fair. The girl's anxiety isn't an excuse for repeatedly canceling, but it's a valid reason. The author's final response might be seen as cutting off someone who is trying, but he has the right to set boundaries around his time.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because he's asserting his needs after repeated disrespect to his time. However, there's a balance between being understanding and setting boundaries. The author did try to be polite initially, but after four times, it's reasonable to express frustration. The girl did have her reasons, but the author isn't obligated to work through her issues without reciprocity or consideration for his own time.\n"
