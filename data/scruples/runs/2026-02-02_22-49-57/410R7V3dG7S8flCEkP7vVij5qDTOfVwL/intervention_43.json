I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a girl who kept canceling plans, and the author eventually told her off for wasting his time.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The girl had anxiety and issues forming relationships. She reached out multiple times, which shows she was interested in connecting. But each time, she canceled last minute. The author is a busy person and felt his time was being wasted. After four cancellations, he politely addressed it, and she apologized. Then she tried again, and even after the author offered alternatives, she canceled again. The author then expressed being fed up and told her off.\n\nSo the author's actions: He communicated his feelings when he felt it was necessary, especially after repeated cancellations. He tried to be understanding but had a limit. The key points here are communication, boundaries, and mutual respect.\n\nThe girl's side: She has anxiety and issues with relationships. She initiated contact multiple times, which might indicate she wanted to build a connection but struggled with following through. Her cancellations might be due to her mental health issues, not just being disrespectful.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The author didn't confront her immediately but after four times. He did approach it politely first. When she tried again, he adjusted his plans to accommodate her, but she still canceled. At that point, he felt it was necessary to set boundaries. \n\nI think the author is justified in feeling frustrated. People should respect each other's time. While it's important to be empathetic, there's a limit to how much one should accommodate another person's issues without being considered. The author didn't act out of malice but out of a need for mutual respect. The girl's repeated cancellations, despite initiating contact, could be seen as inconsiderate, especially when the author made efforts to meet her halfway.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries after repeated disrespect for his time. It's reasonable to expect some level of commitment when plans are made, and the girl's actions crossed that line. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
