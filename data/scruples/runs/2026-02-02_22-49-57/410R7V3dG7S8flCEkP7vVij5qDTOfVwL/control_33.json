I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the girl keeps asking him out, and then cancels the day of each time\u2014four times total. He's polite the first time, but after the fourth, he gets fed up and tells her off. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girl has anxiety and issues forming relationships. She's reaching out, which shows some vulnerability. But the author is a busy person and feels his time is being wasted. He's polite initially, but after multiple cancellations, he's justified in feeling frustrated. \n\nThe key points here are communication and boundaries. The girl might have genuine issues, but repeatedly making plans and then canceling without a firm alternative could be seen as disrespectful. The author tried to accommodate her by suggesting other options when she canceled the last time (like going out instead of her coming to his house), but she still backed out. \n\nThe author's response after the fourth time was to tell her he was insulted and that she shouldn't make plans if she can't commit. Is that too harsh? Well, he did give her chances, and after multiple instances, setting a boundary isn't unreasonable. He also apologized and tried to understand her situation after the fourth cancellation. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could have been more empathetic and suggested alternative ways to connect that don't require her to come to his house. But she kept initiating, which might imply she's ready to commit to some level. However, her anxiety might be beyond her control. \n\nSo, the question is whether the author overstepped. I think he had the right to set a boundary, especially after repeated no-shows. He was polite and gave her chances. His frustration is valid. The girl's actions, while stemming from anxiety, are still impacting his time and plans. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for standing up for himself.\n"
