I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for confronting the girl who canceled on them multiple times.\n\nFirst, the girl initiated contact four times, each time making plans that she canceled on the day. The author was polite the first few times, but after the fourth cancellation, they sent a message about valuing their time. The girl apologized and mentioned her anxiety. Then, the fifth time, she changed the plans again, leading the author to confront her more strongly.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The girl has anxiety and issues forming relationships, which is valid. People with anxiety might struggle with commitments. However, repeatedly making plans and canceling them can be disrespectful to the other person's time. The author has a right to feel frustrated, especially since they're busy and the girl keeps initiating contact.\n\nThe author's response after the fourth cancellation was polite, so they gave her the benefit of the doubt. The fifth time, when the girl changed plans again, the author stood up for themselves. It's reasonable to set boundaries here. The key point is whether the author overstepped. Their final message was about not being treated like they're available whenever, which is a valid sentiment. They didn't attack her personally but addressed the behavior.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries after repeated cancellations. They tried to be understanding but had limits. The girl's anxiety is a factor, but she should have communicated better or not made plans if she couldn't commit. The answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
