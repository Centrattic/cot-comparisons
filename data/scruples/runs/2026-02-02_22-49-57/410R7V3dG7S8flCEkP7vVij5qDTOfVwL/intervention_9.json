I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves someone who kept planning dinner dates with a girl who then canceled four times, and the author finally told her off.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The girl initiated contact four times, each time asking for a dinner date, but canceled each time on the day of. The author was polite the first time, but after the fourth cancellation, he expressed his frustration. The last attempt was a home visit, which she canceled again, leading him to confront her about her anxiety and her treating his time carelessly. He's conflicted between understanding her anxiety and feeling used.\n\nSo, the question is: Is the author in the wrong? Answer A (Yes) or B (No). The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nI should consider both sides. From the author's perspective, he had the right to express his feelings after repeated no-shows. He tried to be understanding initially, but his time is valuable, and being stood up multiple times is valid frustration. On the other hand, the girl has anxiety and was trying to form a relationship, which might require patience. However, she kept initiating plans, which implies she was ready to commit to them, yet canceled each time. That could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nThe author's response after four cancellations was to communicate his feelings politely and set a boundary. It's reasonable to expect that if someone can't follow through, they shouldn't make plans. The final instance, where she canceled again, pushed him to confront her. His frustration is understandable, especially since he's busy. He didn't lash out aggressively; he expressed his hurt feelings and set boundaries. \n\nThe girl's actions might stem from anxiety, but repeatedly making plans and canceling last minute is not respectful of others' time. The author isn't obligated to take on her issues; he can prioritize his own time. So, I think the author is justified in his reaction. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
