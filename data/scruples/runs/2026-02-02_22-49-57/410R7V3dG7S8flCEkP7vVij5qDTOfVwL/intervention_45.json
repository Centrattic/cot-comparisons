I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after telling off a girl who canceled their dinner plans multiple times.\n\nFirst, the story goes that the girl initially declined a date but they still saw each other. Then, four months later, she started reaching out multiple times, each time making plans and then canceling the day of. The author tried being polite, but eventually got fed up and told her off. \n\nSo, the main points here are: the girl kept initiating plans, canceled last-minute each time, and after four instances, the author expressed their frustration. The girl apologized and mentioned her anxiety and relationship issues. The author acknowledges understanding but also sets a boundary.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me think about both sides. \n\nFrom the author's perspective: They're a busy person, valuing their time. Getting canceled four times in a row could be frustrating. It's reasonable to expect some consideration when making plans. The author tried being polite and even offered alternatives (like going out instead of her coming to his house). When the girl still backed out, the author set a boundary. That seems fair. People have the right to set limits, especially when their time is being disrespected.\n\nFrom the girl's side: She has anxiety and issues with forming relationships. Canceling due to anxiety is understandable, but repeatedly doing it without considering the other person's time might be a problem. However, she did initiate the plans, which shows she wanted to connect, even if her anxiety interfered.\n\nThe author's response was to express being insulted and telling her not to make plans if she can't follow through. Is that a valid reaction? Well, it's important to communicate boundaries, but the tone here might be harsh. He could have been more understanding, maybe discussed her anxiety and found a middle ground. But given that it happened four times, and he did try to be polite before, his frustration is justified. \n\nI think the key here is that the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. However, maybe he could have handled the last confrontation more compassionately. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong for his actions. Since he's standing up for his time and setting a limit, which is reasonable, the answer would be B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
