I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author met a girl who initially declined a date but then kept messaging them out of the blue to plan dinner or other activities. Each time, she cancels on the day of the planned meeting. This happened four times. After the fourth cancellation, the author sent a polite message about valuing their time, and she apologized, explaining her anxiety and relationship issues. The author was understanding then. But when she asked again to come over, and then canceled, the author got fed up and told her off, saying they were insulted and that if she has such problems, she shouldn't make plans with them. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider both sides. The girl had anxiety and issues forming relationships, which she explained. She initiated the plans multiple times, but couldn't follow through. The author felt their time was being wasted and got upset, especially after multiple cancellations. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, they're a busy person and might feel that their time is valuable. Constant cancellations can be frustrating, especially when someone keeps making plans they can't keep. The author tried to be understanding and even gave her multiple chances. However, after repeated cancellations, expressing frustration is understandable. People set boundaries, and it's reasonable to expect others to respect their time.\n\nOn the other hand, the girl has anxiety and struggles with relationships. She's seeking connection and reaching out, but her anxiety causes her to back out. She did apologize and explain her issues. The author's response was to tell her off, which might be seen as harsh, especially if the girl is already dealing with mental health challenges. The author might not be in the wrong because they have the right to set boundaries, but maybe they could have handled it with more empathy.\n\nBut the author did try to be polite initially. After four cancellations, even with understanding, it's reasonable to feel that their time isn't being respected. The final incident where she changed the plan again (from coming to his house to staying home) might have been the last straw. The author's reaction was frustration, which is a valid emotion. However, telling her that she shouldn't make plans if she can't follow through might come off as dismissive of her struggles. \n\nIt's a balance between respecting one's own boundaries and being empathetic towards someone's mental health. The author isn't wrong for feeling upset, but maybe could have approached it differently. However, the question is whether they're in the wrong. Since they expressed their feelings and set a boundary, which is their right, I think the answer is B (not in the wrong). But others might argue that they should have been more understanding. It's a bit of a gray area, but the key point is that it's okay to set boundaries when someone repeatedly respects your time negatively.\n"
