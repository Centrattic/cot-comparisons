I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling off a girl who kept canceling plans. So first, I need to break down the situation.\n\nThe girl approached the author four times, each time making plans and then canceling on the day. The author was polite each time, even after the fourth cancellation, and then sent a more direct message about valuing his time. The girl apologized and mentioned her anxiety. Then she tried again, suggesting coming to his house, which she also canceled, leading the author to confront her.\n\nThe key points here are communication and respect. The girl kept initiating plans but couldn't follow through, which might be due to her anxiety. The author is frustrated because his time is being wasted and he's taking it personally. But does that mean he's in the wrong for expressing that frustration?\n\nWell, the author tried to be understanding initially. After multiple cancellations, it's reasonable to feel upset, especially if the person keeps initiating plans without considering the other's time. The author's response was a bit harsh, but he did mention feeling insulted and setting boundaries. The girl's anxiety might be a valid reason, but if she's aware of her issues and still makes plans she can't keep, there's a responsibility to communicate better or not make the plans at all.\n\nThe author's right to feel disrespected is valid. People should be considerate of others' time. However, the way he handled it\u2014getting angry and saying she shouldn't make plans if she can't handle it\u2014might come off as dismissive of her struggles. Maybe a more constructive approach would be better, but does that mean he's in the wrong? Maybe not entirely. He's within his rights to set boundaries. The girl's actions were inconsiderate, so the author isn't wrong to express his feelings. But the tone and approach could be better. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's standing up for himself and his time, the answer is probably B, he's not in the wrong. But I need to make sure I didn't miss any nuances.\n"
