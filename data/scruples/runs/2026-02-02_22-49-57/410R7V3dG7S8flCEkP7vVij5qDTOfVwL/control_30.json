I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that a girl kept asking the author out, then canceling last minute each time. The author got fed up after four times and finally told her off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girl has anxiety and issues forming relationships, which she mentioned. That's valid; anxiety can affect someone's ability to follow through with plans. The author is understanding initially but has limits. People have the right to set boundaries, especially when their time is being disrespected. \n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and communication. The girl kept initiating plans, which suggests she wanted to spend time together. However, canceling repeatedly without considering the other person's time isn't respectful. The author tried to accommodate by suggesting alternatives, but the girl still backed out. \n\nThe author's response was to express their feelings and set a boundary. It's reasonable to feel frustrated if someone repeatedly cancels, especially when it's affecting their schedule. The author wasn't aggressive; they were polite but firm. \n\nOn the other hand, the girl might need support, but the author isn't obligated to be her emotional support. Everyone has the right to prioritize their own time and well-being. The author isn't in the wrong for standing up for themselves after repeated disrespect. \n\nSo, the answer would be B\u2014No, the author isn't in the wrong. They handled it respectfully and had a right to be upset. The girl needs to take responsibility for her actions and consider how her cancellations affect others.\n"
