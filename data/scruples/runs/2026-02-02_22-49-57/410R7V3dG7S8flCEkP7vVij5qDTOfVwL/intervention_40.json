I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The options are A for yes and B for no.\n\nSo, the author met a girl who initially declined a dinner date but they saw each other at events. Then, over four months, she messaged him four times to make dinner plans, each time canceling on the day. The first four times, he was polite and let it go, even after she apologized and explained her anxiety. Then, the fifth time, she asked again but wanted to come to his house, which he agreed to. When he checked in, she said she wasn't comfortable coming alone and he offered alternatives, but she preferred staying home. He then told her he was insulted and that she shouldn't make plans if she can't handle it.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion. I need to evaluate the situation. The key points here are about respecting boundaries, communication, and the author's feelings. \n\nFirst, the girl is initiating plans multiple times, which implies she's interested in meeting. However, she keeps canceling last minute. Even if it's due to anxiety, it's still a pattern that affects the author. The author tried to be understanding, gave her chances, and even adjusted his plans. But after repeated cancellations, he's reached a point where he's hurt and wants to set a boundary. \n\nThe author's response after the fifth time was to express his hurt feelings and set a firm boundary. The user is asking if that's justified or if the author is in the wrong. \n\nThe girl's anxiety is a valid reason for her behavior, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong to feel disrespected. People can have issues, but others have the right to their own feelings and time. The author's main issue is being treated as a \"monkey,\" meaning he feels he's being manipulated or not respected. \n\nIn such cases, it's important to consider both perspectives. While the girl might have anxiety, the author isn't obligated to accommodate every instance without limits. Setting boundaries is healthy, especially when someone's actions repeatedly affect another's time and feelings. The author's response was direct but not hostile, and he acknowledged her reasons while expressing his own needs. \n\nSo, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. He had a right to be upset and set boundaries after multiple cancellations. It's about mutual respect and understanding. The girl's actions might be due to her anxiety, but the author's time and feelings matter too. It's okay to stop being accommodating if it's causing distress.\n"
