I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling off a girl who canceled their dinner plans multiple times because of her nervousness and anxiety.\n\nFirst, the author tried to go out with the girl four times. Each time, the girl initiated contact, made plans, and then canceled the day of. The author was polite the first few times, but after the fourth cancellation, they sent a text about valuing their time. The girl apologized and explained her anxiety. The author was understanding but still felt upset when she canceled again, this time even after the author offered to go out together. The author then confronts her and says they're insulted, telling her not to make plans if she has anxiety issues.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me think about the key points here. The girl is clearly struggling with anxiety and forming relationships. She keeps reaching out, which shows some interest, but can't follow through. The author is feeling used and has a right to be upset about their time being wasted. But the author also acknowledges that they shouldn't take it personally. \n\nThe girl might be testing the waters, trying to build up to the commitment of meeting in person. However, repeatedly canceling after agreeing to meet could be seen as inconsiderate, even if it's due to anxiety. The author's response was to set a boundary, which is reasonable. They didn't lash out but expressed their feelings politely after multiple instances. \n\nOn the other hand, the girl might feel bad about her actions, but the author's frustration is valid. It's important in relationships to communicate boundaries and expectations. The author might not be in the wrong here because they're standing up for themselves after repeated no-shows. However, there's a balance between understanding and being considerate. If the author had given her more support or tried to find alternative arrangements, maybe that would have been better, but the girl didn't show up each time, so the author's time was indeed being wasted. \n\nAlso, the author didn't give an ultimatum before the last attempt. They allowed the girl to try again, and when she canceled once more, they reacted. It's a bit of a dilemma. The girl might need more time, but the author has a right to their time and energy. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they set a boundary after multiple cancellations, and it's okay to prioritize your own time and feelings. But I need to make sure. If the author had been too harsh or didn't consider her anxiety, maybe A. But the author was polite and even tried to be accommodating. The final message was firm but not attacking her personally. So, B seems right.\n"
