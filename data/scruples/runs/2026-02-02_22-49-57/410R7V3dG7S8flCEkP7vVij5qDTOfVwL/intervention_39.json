I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a girl who keeps canceling plans they made. The author initially stayed polite but eventually got fed up and confronted her.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The girl has anxiety and issues with forming relationships. That's a valid reason for her cancellations. The author understands this but is frustrated because it's happened multiple times. They feel their time is being wasted.\n\nBut the author also initiated the confrontation after the fourth cancellation. The girl was the one reaching out each time, so maybe she's in a vulnerable position. The author's response was to tell her off, which might be seen as harsh. However, the author did try to be understanding and polite before that.\n\nThe key points are: the girl's mental health issues, the author's right to value their time, and whether the author's reaction was proportionate. The author did give her chances each time she asked, and finally set a boundary. Setting boundaries is generally acceptable, especially when someone is taking advantage of your time. But was the confrontation necessary, or could the author have handled it more gracefully?\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I agree. The girl's actions were inconsiderate, and the author had the right to express their feelings. They didn't lash out, just communicated their feelings clearly after multiple instances. So the answer is B.\n"
