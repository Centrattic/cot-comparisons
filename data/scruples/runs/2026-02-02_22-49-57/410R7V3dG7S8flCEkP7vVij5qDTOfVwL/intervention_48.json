I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The author received multiple cancellations from a girl he agreed to meet for dinner, and after several instances, he confronts her.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points of the situation. The girl initiated contact four times, each time planning a dinner, but canceled the day of. The author was polite the first time but eventually got fed up and confronted her. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being upset and setting boundaries.\n\nI should consider both sides. On one hand, the girl has anxiety and is struggling, which is a valid reason for her cancellations. The author tried to be understanding initially. On the other hand, repeatedly making plans and canceling last-minute can be seen as disrespectful of the other person's time, especially if it's intentional. The author is a busy person and has the right to value his time.\n\nThe author's response was to communicate his feelings politely initially, then set a boundary when it happened again. It's important to note that he didn't lash out but expressed his feelings. The girl's issue might be genuine, but she should recognize the impact of her actions. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling upset and setting limits. People have the right to their time and should not be taken advantage of, even if the other person has personal struggles. So, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
