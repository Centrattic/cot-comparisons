I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong for confronting the girl who kept canceling plans.\n\nFirst, the girl approached the author multiple times to make plans, which she then canceled each time. The author was polite initially, but after the fourth cancellation, they expressed their frustration about valuing their time. The girl apologized and mentioned anxiety. The author was understanding but eventually got fed up when she canceled again, leading to the confrontation.\n\nSo, the key points here are about boundaries and mutual respect. The girl kept initiating plans but couldn't follow through, which affected the author's time. The author's response was to tell her off after multiple instances, which seems reasonable because everyone has the right to expect some level of commitment when making plans. The author tried to be understanding, acknowledged her anxiety, but had limits.\n\nThe girl's actions, while possibly due to anxiety, repeatedly led the author to feel disrespected. The author's frustration is valid because it's their right to expect that if someone makes plans, they should make an effort to keep them unless there's a valid reason. The final cancellation where she couldn't even go out suggests the author's patience had limits. \n\nIt doesn't seem like the author overreacted. They gave her multiple chances and were polite each time. When the pattern continued, expressing their feelings was a reasonable step. The girl's anxiety isn't a fault, but the author isn't obligated to accommodate repeated cancellations without some boundary.\n\nSo, the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong. They acted appropriately by setting boundaries after persistent issues.\n"
