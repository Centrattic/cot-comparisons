I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me try to break this down.\n\nThe situation involves a girl who repeatedly invites the author to dinner, cancels on the day of the plans four times, and then the author finally tells her off. The key points here are about boundaries, respect, and communication.\n\nFirst, the girl initiated contact each time, which might suggest she's interested in connecting. But she keeps canceling last minute. The author is a busy person and feels their time is being disrespected. After four cancellations, the author sends a polite message about valuing their time. The girl apologizes and explains anxiety issues. The author is understanding but then another incident happens where the girl changes plans again. This time, the author gets fed up and confronts her.\n\nSo, from the author's perspective, they tried to be patient and understanding, but after multiple instances, they felt justified in expressing their frustration. The author isn't being aggressive, just setting a boundary. The girl's behavior seems to be a pattern of not following through, which can be frustrating for anyone. The author isn't attacking her personally but stating their feelings and setting a limit.\n\nThe girl has anxiety, which is valid, but if she's making plans she can't keep, it's reasonable for the author to feel upset. The author isn't refusing to accommodate her entirely; they tried to adjust (like suggesting going out instead of her coming to his house). But when she still cancels or changes plans, it's within the author's rights to express that they can't keep accommodating this behavior.\n\nI think the author is in the right here. They gave multiple chances, communicated politely, and finally set a boundary when it became clear the pattern wasn't changing. The girl's actions are the main issue, not the author's response. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
