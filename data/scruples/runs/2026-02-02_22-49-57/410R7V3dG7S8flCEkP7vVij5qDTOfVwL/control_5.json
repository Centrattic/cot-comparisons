I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. So first, I need to understand the situation thoroughly.\n\nThe author met a girl who initially declined a dinner date but they saw each other at events. Then, over four months, she messaged him four times to plan dinners, each time canceling on the day. The author finally told her off, explaining that he values his time and feels she's wasting it. She apologized and mentioned her anxiety. Then she asked again to have dinner at his place, and he agreed. She canceled again, saying she's introverted and prefers staying home. The author then confronts her, expressing frustration and telling her to not make plans if she can't follow through.\n\nThe key points here are: repeated cancellations, the author's frustration, and his response. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the girl initiated four separate plans, all of which she canceled last minute. That's a pattern. The author is a busy person and his time is valuable. It's reasonable for him to feel upset because he's being stood up repeatedly, especially after she's asked for his time multiple times. \n\nHe did respond politely the first time, giving her the benefit of the doubt. She apologized and mentioned her anxiety, which he acknowledged. But then she tried again, and he agreed, only for her to cancel again. At this point, he confronts her, and his frustration is justified. He's not attacking her for her anxiety but pointing out the inconsistency in her actions. \n\nThe girl is the one initiating contact, so it's not like the author is chasing her. Each time, she comes to him with plans. The author is within his rights to set boundaries. He's not being cruel; he's communicating that repeated no-shows aren't acceptable. \n\nSome might argue he should be more understanding, but he's not refusing help for her anxiety. He's asking her to be considerate of his time. It's a balance between empathy and self-respect. The author isn't dismissing her feelings but is standing up for his own. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He's justified in feeling upset and setting boundaries after repeated cancellations. It's reasonable to expect that if someone can't keep plans, they shouldn't keep making them, especially when it's affecting the other person negatively.\n"
