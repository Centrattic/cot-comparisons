I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong after telling off a girl who canceled plans multiple times because she was too nervous. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author had four instances where the girl asked for dinner, canceled on the day of each time. The author was polite the first time but then after the fourth cancellation, they expressed frustration about their time being wasted. The girl apologized and explained her anxiety. The latest time, she wanted to come over, but then canceled again, and the author got fed up and told her off.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The girl initiated the plans each time, which shows she was interested in some way. However, canceling repeatedly without notice (the day of) is inconsiderate, regardless of the reason. The author has a right to feel frustrated, especially if they're busy. But the girl has anxiety, which the author acknowledged.\n\nThe author's response was to confront her in a way that's not aggressive but clear, stating that they don't want to be treated as someone who can be taken for granted. The key points here are communication and mutual respect. \n\nThe author wasn't passive-aggressive or mean; they were direct about their feelings and boundaries. The girl's actions, while stemming from anxiety, repeatedly led to broken plans. The author's frustration is valid because consistent no-shows can be disrespectful to the other person's time and efforts.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could have tried to be more understanding, but there's a balance. It's okay to set boundaries when someone's behavior is affecting you negatively. The author's response was reasonable given the pattern of cancellations. They gave the girl the benefit of the doubt initially but eventually stood up for themselves when the pattern continued.\n\nSo, the answer seems to be B. The author isn't in the wrong because they communicated their feelings respectfully and set a boundary after repeated inconsiderate behavior. It's about mutual respect in a relationship, and the author has every right to value their time.\n"
