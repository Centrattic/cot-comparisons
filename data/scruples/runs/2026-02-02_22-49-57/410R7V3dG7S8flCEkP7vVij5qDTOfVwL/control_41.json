I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a girl who repeatedly cancels plans, and the author eventually tells her off.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girl asked to go out four times, each time the author agreed, and she canceled each time. The author was polite the first time, then after the fourth cancellation, he expressed his frustration. The girl apologized and mentioned her anxiety. The last time, she wanted to make dinner at his place but canceled again, leading the author to confront her.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The girl's actions: she's initiating contact but cancels last minute. She has anxiety, which she explained. The author tried to be understanding initially but eventually set boundaries. \n\nIs it wrong to feel upset about repeated cancellations? People have different boundaries. The author is a busy person, so his time is valuable. Repeated cancellations without prior communication could be seen as disrespectful, even if there's anxiety involved. However, the author did give her multiple chances. \n\nThe girl's responsibility is to communicate her issues and maybe not make plans if she can't follow through. The author's response was to set a boundary after several instances. It's reasonable to feel disrespected, especially after multiple times. The author's tone in the last message might be harsh, but setting boundaries isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could have tried to find a solution that works for both, but he decided it's not worth it. It's a judgment call. The key is whether the author overstepped. Since he finally communicated his feelings after multiple instances, and the girl was aware of his feelings, it's more about mutual respect. The author isn't in the wrong because he's asserting his own needs after being patient. So the answer is B, No.\n"
