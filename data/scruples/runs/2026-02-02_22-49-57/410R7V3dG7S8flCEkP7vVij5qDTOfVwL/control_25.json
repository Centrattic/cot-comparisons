I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about someone who kept asking another person out, but then canceled each time on the day of the plans. The author got fed up after four times and confronted the girl, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girl has anxiety and issues with forming relationships, which she apologized for. She initiated the plans each time, which shows she wanted to connect. On the other hand, the author feels their time is being wasted and finally stood up for themselves by expressing frustration.\n\nThe key points here are: Did the author overreact? Is it reasonable to feel upset after multiple cancellations? The girl's mental health is a factor too. But the author did give her chances and was polite initially. After the fourth cancellation, they communicated their feelings clearly and respectfully. The last incident where she changed plans again might have been the last straw.\n\nThe author's right to set boundaries is important. It's okay to feel hurt when someone keeps canceling, especially if they're the ones initiating. The author's response was to tell her they were insulted and that she shouldn't make plans if she can't follow through. That seems like a reasonable boundary, not an attack. The girl's anxiety is valid, but the author isn't responsible for fixing her issues. They have the right to prioritize their own time and feelings.\n\nSo, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they set clear boundaries after repeated cancellations, which is understandable and reasonable.\n"
