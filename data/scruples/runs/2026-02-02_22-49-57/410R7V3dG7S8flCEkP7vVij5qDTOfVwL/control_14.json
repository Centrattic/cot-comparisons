I asked her out to dinner and she declined but we still saw eachother at functions. I understand if someone is not interested in me and I never hold it against anybody.\n\n\nAbout 4-5 months ago this girl randomly messages me out of the blue and asks me if I want to go have dinner with her. I say that sounds great and we make a time or a place. The day of the date, she says that she can't make it and I say \"ok no problem\".\n\n3 more times the same exact thing happened. Out of the blue, she messages me and either asks to go out to dinner, or offers to come to my house to make dinner. And each of the 3 times, she cancels the day of. After the 4th time she cancels on me, I send her a super polite text saying that I really value my time and that I don't appreciate her treating my time like she can waste it. She appologizes profusely and says that she has alot of issues especially with forming any kind of relationship and has anxiety. I understand and say \"its no worries\" and just leave it at that.\n\n\nLast week I get a phone call from her and she asks me if she can come to my house and make my dinner. I say no problem sounds good. The day of the dinner, I text her asking her if shes still coming and she tells me that she dosnt feel comfortable going to my house by herself (keep in mind, she is the one who keeps initiating all of this). I say \"np, we can go get dinner or go out for a beer\" and she says that shes feeling introverted and just wanted to stay home.\n\nAt this point I am pretty fucking fed up. I am a very busy person and... on one hand, I can understand her feelings and have respect. On the other hand she is treating me like a monkey who can dance whenever she wants and thats not the case.\n\nSo I pretty much told her that I was insulted that she keeps doing this, and if she has that big of a problem with her anxiety and past experiences then she simply shouldnt make plans with me. \n\nShould I be more understanding and try my best to work her through her problems, or is it wrong for me to feel upset and take it personally?\n\n\nI know I shouldnt take it personally, but for her to initiate it that many times and cancel that many times it just makes me upset.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling off a girl who kept canceling their plans. The scenario involves multiple instances where the girl initiated plans but canceled each time, leading to the author's frustration.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The girl has anxiety and issues forming relationships, which is a valid struggle. People with anxiety might find it hard to commit to plans, especially if they're not in a stable place mentally. However, repeatedly making plans and canceling can be seen as disrespectful to the other person's time and feelings.\n\nThe author tried being polite the first few times, but after four cancellations, they expressed their frustration. It's reasonable to feel taken advantage of when someone keeps setting up expectations and then breaking them. The author isn't in a relationship with the girl, so they might not have the same responsibility to be patient as they would in a committed relationship. \n\nThe key points here are communication and boundaries. The author did give feedback in a respectful way initially. When the behavior continued, it's understandable that they'd feel justified in setting clearer boundaries. The girl's actions repeatedly disregarded the author's time, so the author's response is about self-respect.\n\nOn the other hand, the girl might need more understanding, but there's a balance between empathy and self-care. The author isn't obligated to continue being accommodating if it's causing them stress. Relationships, even potential ones, require mutual respect. If one person can't respect the other's time, it's not a healthy dynamic.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing their frustration and setting boundaries. They've shown patience initially and only reacted after repeated cancellations. Their right to feel upset and take it personally is valid, given the pattern of behavior. The answer should be B (No).\n"
