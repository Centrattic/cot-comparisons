C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to get all the details straight.\n\nThe author had a relationship with a girl named C, who had a tough upbringing. Her parents were absent or died, and she was raised by religious grandparents. C had bipolar disorder, which made her moods erratic. She wanted to get married and have a family, but the author wasn't interested in marriage. They were sexually active without using condoms, and C was on birth control. Later, C was diagnosed with PCOS, which made conception harder for her. Despite that, she ended up pregnant. The author tried to convince her to get an abortion, which she agreed to, but then when they tried to go through with it, something happened\u2014her cat was run over by her grandparents' car, and they saw it as a sign from God to keep the baby. The author broke up with her after that. Now the child is five, and the author hasn't been involved, only paying child support. He feels guilty when he hears the child says he doesn't play with him, but he's still firm on his decision because he feels C was selfish and deceitful in getting him pregnant. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, considering the law, in most places, a father's responsibility to support a child is mandatory regardless of whether they wanted the child or not. But the author isn't in contact, just paying support. Legally, he's meeting his obligations. But morally, the situation is more complex. The author argues that C deceived him by hiding the pregnancy and then changing her mind after the \"miracle\" event. However, the pregnancy was his child as well. Even if he opposed the pregnancy, once it's born, there's a moral duty to be involved. Also, C had mental health issues, which might complicate her judgment, but that doesn't necessarily exonerate the author from his responsibility.\n\nOn one hand, the author wasn't ready for a child and felt pressured by C's desires. On the other, once the child is born, cutting off contact could be seen as neglectful. The fact that the child is saying his daddy doesn't play with him adds emotional weight. The author might feel wronged by C's actions, but his current stance of not engaging with the child could be seen as self-punishment or avoiding responsibility. \n\nThere's also the aspect of consent and control. The author didn't want a child, and C took actions that led to his parenthood. However, once a child is born, the parent's responsibilities extend beyond just financial support. The emotional and psychological impact on the child is significant. The author's guilt is evident, but he's sticking to his decision, possibly out of anger towards C. \n\nIn terms of ethics, some might argue that the author is in the wrong because parenthood is a lifelong commitment, and his refusal to be involved harms the child. Others might sympathize with his position, considering the circumstances of the pregnancy and the pressure he felt. But ultimately, the child's well-being is a key factor here. The author's decision affects the child's life, and not engaging could be detrimental. \n\nSo, while the author might feel justified in his actions given the circumstances, morally, many would argue that he has a duty to be present for his child, regardless of his initial opposition to the pregnancy. Therefore, he might be in the wrong.\n"
