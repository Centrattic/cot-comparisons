C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with his pregnant girlfriend is in the wrong. The situation involves a lot of factors: the girlfriend's mental health, her family's religious influence, and the unexpected pregnancy leading to an abortion decision that didn't go through. \n\nFirst, the man and his ex-girlfriend were in a high school relationship. She had a tough upbringing and mental health issues. He wasn't interested in marriage or kids, but they had unprotected sex with her on birth control. She later got pregnant but had PCOS, which made her worried about fertility. When she got pregnant, he wanted an abortion, but she changed her mind after a \"miracle\" with her cat. He broke up with her, refuses to be involved, pays child support but not contact.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but is asking for my opinion. I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the man argues he wasn't ready for a child, and she manipulated the situation. On the other, the child is now 5, and he's cutting contact, which could harm the child's life. \n\nLegally, he has responsibilities as a father, but emotionally and ethically, is he at fault? The woman's actions were deceitful, but the man's refusal to engage might be seen as selfish now. The child's well-being is a big factor. The man's parents are involved, which complicates things. \n\nThe key points are consent in the pregnancy, the woman's mental state, and the impact on the child. The man didn't want the child and felt deceived, but by breaking up and avoiding contact, he's denying the child a father. It's a tough call. Legally, he might have obligations, but morally, there's a lot to unpack. The author's stance is that he's not in the wrong, but others might argue he's neglecting his child's needs. I think the answer is A (he's in the wrong) because while the woman's actions were problematic, once the child exists, the man has a responsibility. Abandoning the child seems harmful regardless of the circumstances.\n"
