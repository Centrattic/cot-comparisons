C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The main points are:\n\n1. The author had a 3-year relationship in high school with a girl named C who had a tough upbringing and mental health issues (bipolar disorder). She was religious and wanted to have a family, but the author wasn't ready for marriage or kids.\n\n2. They used birth control but didn't use condoms, leading to C getting pregnant. The author convinced her to get an abortion, but on the day of the procedure, the cat was killed, which C's family saw as a sign from God to keep the child. The author then broke up with her.\n\n3. Now, the child N is 5, and the author hasn't been involved, only paying child support. People think he's wrong, but he feels C was selfish and that he wasn't ready. He's conflicted because he feels guilty but isn't changing his mind.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault. Let's consider both sides.\n\nFrom the author's perspective: He wasn't ready for a child, didn't want to have one, and felt that C was being selfish by getting pregnant secretly. He tried to get an abortion but C changed her mind due to a \"miracle\" with the cat. He broke up because of that. He's paying child support but not being a parent. He might believe he has a right to not be a father if he wasn't prepared.\n\nFrom others' perspective: C got pregnant, and even if she was manipulative or deceptive, once the child is born, the father has responsibilities. The author is avoiding those responsibilities, which is seen as immoral. The child is starting school and is affected by the absence of a father figure. The author's actions could be harming the child.\n\nLegal standpoint: In many places, fathers are legally responsible for their children, regardless of the circumstances of the pregnancy or birth. The author isn't just avoiding emotional contact but also isn't providing a father role, which can impact the child's development. Even if the pregnancy was unwanted, once the child is born, there's a legal and moral obligation to be involved.\n\nMoral standpoint: Some might argue that the author's responsibility extends beyond just money. Being a parent involves more than financial support. The child's emotional needs are important. The author's decision to cut off completely could be seen as selfish now, as the child is growing up without a father's presence.\n\nC's actions: She had a mental health condition (bipolar), which might affect her judgment. However, she knew the author didn't want kids and still chose to have the child. That could be seen as her making a choice, but it's also possible she was in a manic episode or not thinking clearly due to her mental state. However, the author could have addressed this earlier by setting boundaries or ensuring proper contraceptive use beyond just the pill, since they didn't use condoms.\n\nThe author's responsibility: Even if he feels deceived, the child is his. Avoiding all contact might not be the best for the child. The author's guilt is evident, but he's choosing not to act on it, which could be seen as prioritizing his own feelings over the child's well-being.\n\nIn summary, while the author's reasons for not wanting to be a father are understandable, once the child is born, there's a societal and moral expectation to be part of the child's life. The author's refusal to engage beyond financial support might be considered wrong because it affects the child's development and emotional health. So, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
