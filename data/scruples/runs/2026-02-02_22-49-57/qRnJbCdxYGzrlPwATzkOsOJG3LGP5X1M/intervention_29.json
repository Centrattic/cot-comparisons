C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. They've given a detailed backstory.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author broke up with his girlfriend after she got pregnant. She had a history of mental health issues, including bipolar disorder, which might have affected her decision-making. They were not married, and he wasn't ready for a child. She hid the pregnancy, then decided to keep the baby after a \"miraculous\" event involving her cat. He supported the abortion initially but she changed her mind, so he left. Now, he's not involved with the child, paying support but not engaging, and feels judged.\n\nThe question is whether he's at fault. The user thinks he's not, but wants another opinion. Let me break it down. \n\nLegally, he's paying child support, which is right. But emotionally and ethically, there's more. The woman had mental health issues, which might have clouded her judgment. She concealed the pregnancy, which is a big deal. The author wasn't ready and was pressured to propose earlier. But once the pregnancy happened, he tried to get an abortion, which she refused after the cat incident. \n\nNow, the child is 5, and the author isn't involved. He feels guilt but refuses to change his stance. The mother's actions were secretive and possibly manipulative, using religion to justify keeping the child. The author's refusal to engage might be seen as neglectful, but he argues she disrespected him by not being honest.\n\nIt's a tough call. On one hand, he's not fulfilling a father's role, which is important for the child. On the other, he was coerced into a situation he didn't want, and the mother's behavior was questionable. However, once the child exists, he has a responsibility. But the mother's deception and mental health might mitigate his responsibility somewhat. \n\nStill, as a father, even if he didn't want the child, he has a duty to be involved. His current stance might be seen as abandoning the child. But given the circumstances of the pregnancy being a result of her manipulation, maybe some leniency is there. \n\nI think there's fault on both sides. The author's decision to not be involved could be seen as wrong because it affects the child negatively. The mother's actions were selfish and dishonest. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given that he's responsible for the child, not engaging could be considered wrong. So maybe the answer is A. But I'm a bit split. The user says they think he's not wrong. But from a broader moral perspective, he has a duty to his child regardless of the past. So I think A (he is wrong) is the answer.\n"
