C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend and not being involved in his child's life.\n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The author had a girlfriend, C, who had a tough background and mental health issues. They were in a high school relationship, and C wanted to get married and have a family. The author didn't seem to be interested in marriage, but they were sexually active without condoms while she was on birth control. Then she developed polycystic ovary syndrome, which made pregnancy harder for her. Despite that, she got pregnant. The author found out and wanted an abortion, even arranging for her to go to Melbourne to get one. But before the abortion happened, the car accident with the cat happened, and she decided to keep the baby. The author then broke up with her and hasn't been involved except for child support. Now the child is 5, and the author is facing guilt and judgment.\n\nSo the key points here are: Was the author wrong to break up with her after the pregnancy? Did he have a right to expect an abortion since he didn't want a child? Did C's actions deceive him by hiding the pregnancy and then changing her mind when the cat died? Also, is the author in the wrong for not being involved in the child's life despite paying child support?\n\nFrom one angle, the author didn't want a child and wasn't ready. He thought he had an agreement with C that they wouldn't have kids, but she went against that. She hid the pregnancy, which could be seen as deceptive. The author's decision to break up might be seen as protecting his own life and autonomy, but then cutting off the child entirely seems harsh. On the other hand, children have rights, and the father does have legal and moral responsibilities beyond just financial support.\n\nBut legally, in many places, a father can't just walk away. Even if he didn't want the child, he's still responsible for the child's well-being. The fact that he's not involved in the child's life, despite the mother's actions, could be seen as neglectful. The child's comment about not playing with him adds to the guilt.\n\nHowever, the author's perspective is that he was wronged because he wasn't given a choice and that C was selfish. But in reality, when a man impregnates a woman, he does have responsibilities. The fact that they were having sex without condoms, even if she was on birth control, means both parties had some responsibility. The author's ultimatum might have been too extreme, but the mother's decision to continue the pregnancy after he didn't want the child complicates things.\n\nMentally, the mother's bipolar disorder and Catholic upbringing might have influenced her actions, but that doesn't absolve the father from his responsibilities. The author's choice to not be part of the child's life could be seen as prioritizing his own feelings over the child's needs. Even if the mother was at fault in some ways, the child is a separate person with rights to know and have a relationship with their father.\n\nSo, considering all that, while the mother's actions were questionable and the author had valid feelings about not wanting a child, the author has a responsibility to his child. The fact that he's cutting off contact entirely, despite the child's need for a father figure, seems to make him at least partly at fault. His refusal to engage, even as the child grows up and starts school, is causing emotional harm. So I think the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
