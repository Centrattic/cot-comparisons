C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, the key points from the scenario: The author was in a high school relationship with a girl who had a tough upbringing and mental health issues. The girl wanted to get married and have kids, but the author wasn't interested. Despite being on birth control, the girl became pregnant and they decided to get an abortion. However, before the procedure, the girl had a miracle moment with her cat dying, which she and her family saw as a sign to keep the baby. The author felt forced into this and ended up breaking up with her. Now, the child is five, and the author hasn't been involved, but pays child support. He feels guilty when the child mentions not having a dad, but he's firm in his decision.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's argument is that the girl was deceptive, manipulated the situation (by hiding the pregnancy and then using the cat incident as a sign), and that he wasn't ready for a child. On the other hand, the girl's perspective might be that she had a right to carry the child to term, especially after the pregnancy was already ongoing. The author did agree to the abortion initially but then the cat incident changed things. He also didn't use protection, contributing to the pregnancy.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the author is fulfilling his obligation by paying child support. The ethical aspect is more complex. The user's initial thought is that the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to evaluate if that's fair. The author did have a right to not want a child, but once the child was born, his responsibilities as a parent began. Even if he didn't want the child, he's still the father and has a duty to be involved in the child's life. However, the girl's actions in deceiving him and then changing her mind might have contributed to his decision. But cutting off contact entirely might harm the child, regardless of his feelings towards the mother.\n\nThe author's stance is that he's standing by his decision because he feels wronged. But the child's well-being is a separate issue. Even if the mother was at fault, the father's disengagement could be seen as neglectful. So, there's a conflict between his rights and the child's needs.\n\nIn many cultures and legal systems, parental rights and responsibilities are important. The author's refusal to engage with the child could be seen as morally wrong, even if he was initially wronged. The child deserves a relationship with both parents if possible. So, the author might be in the wrong now because his decision is affecting the child's life negatively, even if the circumstances were complicated.\n"
