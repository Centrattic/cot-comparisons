C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend. The story is pretty complicated, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the man was in a 3-year relationship with a woman named C. C has a difficult past with her father abandoning her and her mother's suicide. She was raised by devout Catholic grandparents and has bipolar disorder, which caused mood swings. The key points here are her mental health and her desire to have a family, which was central to her, especially after being told she might have trouble conceiving due to PCOS.\n\nThe man didn't want to get married and didn't see it happening. They had unprotected sex, and C ended up pregnant. He found out and tried to convince her to get an abortion, which she initially agreed to. But then, on the day they were going to get the abortion, her cat was hit by the car, and she and her grandparents saw it as a divine sign to keep the child. The man then broke up with her and hasn't been involved, though he pays child support.\n\nNow, people are judging him for not being involved in his child's life. He feels guilty when he hears his son says he doesn't play with his daddy but is firm in his decision, feeling that C was selfish for tricking him into having a child.\n\nTo determine if the author is in the wrong, I need to consider both sides. Legally, he's paying child support, which is his responsibility. Emotionally, he didn't want the child, and the mother's actions led to this situation. But then, once the child is born, he's a legal father, so he has responsibilities. Did he have a right to not want the child? In some places, birth fathers can lose rights if they don't take responsibility, but he's paying support. However, choosing not to have contact could be seen as neglecting his parental duties.\n\nC's actions were questionable: hiding the pregnancy, then changing her mind due to a perceived miracle. But she did agree to the abortion until the last moment. The man's ultimatum might have been valid from his perspective, but then he's stuck with the situation after she changes her mind. \n\nEthically, there's a debate here. Some might say he's responsible now, regardless of the circumstances. Others might argue that the mother manipulated the situation. The man's guilt over the child's statement is a sign of his internal conflict. But he's not taking steps to mend the relationship, which could affect the child's well-being. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's complex. The man's actions were consistent with his stance, but he's not engaging with his child. The mother's actions were impulsive and possibly selfish. However, once the child exists, the father has a role. The man's choice to pay support but not be involved could be seen as neglectful. So maybe the answer is A\u2014yes, he's in the wrong because he's not fulfilling his parental role despite the circumstances. But others might say he's not at fault for the way he was manipulated. This is a tough call. I need to balance legal and ethical perspectives.\n"
