C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is complicated, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author (he) was in a relationship with a girl (C) who had a tough upbringing and mental health issues\u2014bipolar disorder. They were sexually active without using condoms, and she was on birth control. Then, she was diagnosed with PCOS, which made her fear infertility. She tried to get pregnant, lied about it when she did, and then after the author convinced her to abort, a cat was hit by her car that they took as a divine sign to keep the baby. The author broke up, didn't participate in the child's life, only pays child support. Now he's questioned about his choice.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants my perspective. The options are A (Yes, he's wrong) or B (No, he's not).\n\nI need to consider the ethical and moral aspects here. The author didn't want children, and C manipulated the situation by hiding her pregnancy. But once the child is born, the author's responsibility as a parent is a key factor. Even if the pregnancy was a result of deception, once the child is born, does the father have a duty to be involved? \n\nIn many societies and legal systems, parental responsibility doesn't end at birth. The author is paying child support, which is legally required, but emotional involvement is another matter. However, the child is growing up without a father figure, which can have long-term effects. The author's decision to cut ties might be seen as selfish, but he feels wronged by the manipulation and lack of consent. \n\nOn one hand, C's actions were deceptive and possibly manipulative, especially considering her mental health issues. On the other, the author's refusal to engage with his child could be seen as neglectful. The question is whether his decision was a reasonable response to being coerced into parenthood without consent. \n\nThere's also the matter of consent. The author claims he wasn't ready for a child and that C went against his wishes. However, once a child is born, the father's rights and responsibilities come into play regardless of initial consent. So, even if the pregnancy was a result of deception, the child's well-being is a factor here. \n\nMoral judgments vary. Some might say the author is a coward for not taking responsibility, while others might empathize with his lack of readiness and the manipulation he faced. The fact that the child is now expressing confusion about his absence adds emotional weight to the situation. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's initial reaction might be understandable given the circumstances, his ongoing refusal to be part of the child's life could be seen as morally wrong. The child's right to a relationship with both parents might outweigh the author's feelings of being wronged by C. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (he is in the wrong), but it's a nuanced situation.\n"
