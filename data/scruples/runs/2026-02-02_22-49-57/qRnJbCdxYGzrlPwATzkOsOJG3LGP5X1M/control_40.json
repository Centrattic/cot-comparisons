C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he broke up with his pregnant girlfriend after she had already had an abortion but then later got pregnant again, and he doesn't want to be involved with the child. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the timeline and the decisions made. The girlfriend, C, had a history of mental health issues, including bipolar disorder and a difficult upbringing. She wanted to get married and have kids, but he wasn't interested in marriage. They were using birth control but not condoms, and she ended up getting pregnant. He wanted an abortion, and she agreed, but then something happened with the cat dying, leading her to believe it was a sign to keep the baby. He then broke up with her and hasn't been involved with the child.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. From a legal standpoint, in many places, a non-custodial parent is still responsible for child support and can be involved in the child's life. Even if he didn't want the child, he's the legal father, so he might have obligations. Emotionally and morally, it's a different angle. He says he felt forced into a situation he wasn't ready for, and she deceived him. But she was pregnant again after the abortion, so maybe he's being inconsistent. Also, the child is now 5, and he's not involved, which might be affecting the child's well-being.\n\nOn one hand, he claims he wasn't given a choice and that she was selfish. But he was in a relationship with her, had a child with her, and didn't take any precautions beyond birth control, which failed. Her mental health might complicate things, but he still has a responsibility. Also, cutting off contact entirely might be harming the child. While he has the right to set boundaries, completely refusing to be a father could be seen as morally wrong, even if legally he might be following the situation as it stands. \n\nPeople might argue that once a child is born, the parent has a duty, regardless of initial intentions. His guilt over the child saying \"my daddy doesn't play with me\" suggests he might have some regret, but he's still firm. So, the answer likely is A (he's in the wrong) because despite his reasons, he's not fulfilling his parental role, which affects the child's life. But I need to make sure there's no nuance I'm missing, like if there were legal battles or if she's preventing contact, but the story says he refuses to take part, so it's his choice.\n"
