C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend. The situation is pretty complex, so I need to break it down carefully.\n\nFirst, the author and his girlfriend, C, were in a high school relationship. She had a traumatic past with her parents, which led to her being under the care of grandparents who are devout Catholics. She's also bipolar, which caused some erratic behavior. They didn't use condoms, and she was on birth control. Then she developed PCOS, which made pregnancy harder, but she still got pregnant. The author wanted an abortion, and she agreed to go through with it. But on the day they were going, the cat got hit by the car, and she saw it as a sign from God to keep the baby. The author then broke up with her, and even though he pays child support, he hasn't been involved in the child's life. Now the child is 5 and doesn't understand why the father isn't around.\n\nThe key points here are consent and autonomy. The author argues that he wasn't ready for a child and that she deceived him by hiding the pregnancy. But pregnancy is a shared responsibility. Even if she wanted to have a child more, the decision to carry it to term is also hers once the abortion is off the table. The author's ultimatum\u2014me or the baby\u2014might have been manipulative, especially since he's the one who wasn't ready. But once she decided against the abortion, he broke up with her and cut off contact. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, he's correct in paying child support. But emotionally and morally, cutting off contact with a child might be seen as neglectful. The child is now forming his own understanding of the situation, and the father's absence is affecting him. The author's guilt is there, but he's holding onto the belief that he was wronged. \n\nThere's also the aspect of her mental health. She has bipolar disorder and a history of being taken advantage of, which might have influenced her decision-making. The author could have been more supportive instead of just cutting her off. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. The initial breakup was after she chose to keep the child, which he wasn't ready for. He's not in the wrong for not wanting to be a parent, but by cutting off contact and not being involved, he's failing the child. However, the initial decision to break up wasn't against her will once she chose to keep the baby. Yet, the ongoing non-contact is problematic. \n\nThe answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because even though he didn't want the child, once the child exists, he has a responsibility. But the initial breakup was a response to her choice, which he didn't force her to make. It's a tough call. The child's well-being now is suffering because of his absence. So maybe A, but the initial breakup isn't the issue as much as the continued disconnection.\n"
