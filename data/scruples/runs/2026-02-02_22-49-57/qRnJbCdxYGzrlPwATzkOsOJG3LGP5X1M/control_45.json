C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the background: The author had a 3-year relationship in high school with a girl who had a tough upbringing and was dealing with bipolar disorder. She wanted to get married and have a family, but the author wasn't ready. She hid her pregnancy, and when they found out, the author wanted an abortion. They were set to go to Melbourne for the procedure, but then the cat was run over, which they saw as a miracle. She decided to keep the baby, and the author broke up with her. Now he's not involved in the child's life, but pays child support. People are judging him for abandoning his child, and he's feeling conflicted.\n\nSo, the key points here are the author's refusal to have a child and the girlfriend's deception. There's also the mental health aspect of the girlfriend, with bipolar disorder and a traumatic past. The author feels he was a victim of manipulation, while others see him as selfish for not being involved in his child's life.\n\nLegally, he might have a responsibility to pay child support, which he's doing, but emotionally and socially, there's a lot of criticism. The question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nFrom one angle, he didn't want to be a parent and was deceived into a situation he wasn't prepared for. His decision to break up was to avoid a life he didn't choose. However, he's avoiding responsibility by not engaging with his child, which is a big part of being a parent. Even though he's paying financially, emotional and social absence can be harmful to the child.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's actions\u2014hiding the pregnancy and using her mental health as a reason\u2014might mitigate some blame, but she did have a choice in the end. The author's refusal to change his stance despite the child growing up without a father could be seen as selfish now.\n\nBut the line between personal choice and parental responsibility is blurry here. The author's mental state and the pressure from the girlfriend's circumstances complicate things. However, society often places a high value on parental involvement, regardless of the circumstances of the child's birth. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author is in the wrong because he's not taking full responsibility for his child's upbringing, even if he didn't want the child initially. The child has a right to a relationship with both parents, unless there's a valid reason to avoid it, which isn't clearly presented here. The author's stance now seems more about pride or past feelings rather than the child's well-being.\n"
