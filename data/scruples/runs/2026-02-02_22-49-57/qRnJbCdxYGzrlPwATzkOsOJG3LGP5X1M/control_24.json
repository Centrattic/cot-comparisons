C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is pretty complex, so I need to break it down carefully.\n\nFirst, the author broke up with his pregnant girlfriend, C. She had a rough upbringing and had mental health issues\u2014bipolar disorder. They were in a high school relationship, and he wasn't interested in marriage. She wanted kids, but then got diagnosed with PCOS, which made her panic. They had unprotected sex, and she got pregnant. He wanted an abortion, and she agreed, but then when the cat died, she changed her mind, claiming it was a miracle from God. The author then broke up with her and hasn't been involved in their child's life, only paying child support. Now, the kid is saying he doesn't play with his dad, and the author feels guilty but still stands by his decision.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's look at both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author argues that he was not ready for a child, that C deceived him by hiding the pregnancy and then changing her mind. He also mentions that she was being selfish. He might feel that he had no say in the matter when she decided to keep the child after the abortion was called off. His perspective is that he was wronged by her actions, leading to his decision to cut ties.\n\nOn the other hand, the child's well-being is a major factor. The author is not involved in the child's life, which can be detrimental. Even though he's paying child support, emotional and social involvement is crucial for a child's development. The fact that the child is already expressing that his dad doesn't play with him suggests that the lack of involvement is affecting the child. Also, the author's stance that he's not changing his mind might be seen as being selfish now, as the child needs a father figure.\n\nLegally, he's paying child support, so he's fulfilling that obligation. But emotionally and socially, the father's role is about more than money. The mother's actions were arguably selfish in proceeding without the father's consent, but once the child is born, the father's responsibility might be seen as a duty regardless of the circumstances of the conception. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the mother's mental health. She had bipolar disorder, which might have influenced her decisions. The author might not have fully considered or supported her through her mental health struggles, leading to the pregnancy being hidden and the subsequent breakdown.\n\nHowever, the author's refusal to maintain contact now could be seen as abdicating responsibility. Even if he didn't want the child initially, the child is now a person with his own life. The author's guilt is a sign that he might be reconsidering, but he's not acting on it. \n\nSociety often places a high value on parental involvement, so the author's lack of contact might be judged harshly. The mother's actions were wrong in deceiving him, but that doesn't negate the child's right to a relationship with the father. \n\nIn terms of morality, it's a tough call. The author was wronged initially, but now that the child is in the world, his decision to cut off all contact might be seen as inconsiderate of the child's needs. The child's well-being should take precedence, even if the circumstances leading to the child's birth were contentious. \n\nSo, while the mother's actions were questionable and the author had valid reasons for not wanting the child, the current situation where he's not part of the child's life could be seen as where he's in the wrong now. The author's choice to prioritize his own feelings over the child's need for a father figure might lead to the conclusion that he is in the wrong.\n"
