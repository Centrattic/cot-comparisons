C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he broke up with his pregnant girlfriend, C, after she decided to keep the baby instead of getting an abortion as he had insisted. Now, people are saying he's in the wrong for not being involved in his son's life. He's feeling guilty but still stands by his decision.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author argues that C was being selfish by getting pregnant despite the fact that he didn't want kids. He also mentions that she hid the pregnancy and then went against the plan to get an abortion when the cat was run over. He feels she disrespected him by not honoring their agreement. On the other hand, C had a traumatic past, mental health issues (bipolar disorder), and her family is very religious. She had PCOS, which made her fear infertility, so when she found out she was pregnant, maybe she felt pressured to keep the child. \n\nHe broke up with her, refused to be part of the child's life, but pays child support. Now the child is 5 and doesn't know his father. The author is conflicted but still believes he's not in the wrong. The question is whether he's at fault.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, he's paying child support, which is his responsibility, but emotionally and ethically, there's a dilemma. Even if he didn't want a child, once the child exists, he has a responsibility. The author's argument is that he was wronged by C's actions, but C had her own reasons. However, by cutting off contact entirely, he's denying the child a father. The guilt he feels is valid, but his actions have consequences. \n\nSociety generally values parental involvement, even if the parent doesn't want the child. The child has a right to know and have a relationship with both parents. The author's stance might be seen as selfish now because he's prioritizing his own feelings over the child's well-being. Even if C was manipulative, the child is innocent. The author's refusal to engage could be seen as neglecting his parental duties. \n\nBut then, the circumstances leading up to the pregnancy might be relevant. C's mental health and manipulation play a role here. However, once the child is born, the legal and moral responsibilities are his. The author's decision to cut ties might be his choice, but others might judge him for it, especially when the child is affected. \n\nIn terms of morality, different people have different views. Some might side with him because he was a victim of manipulation, while others would say he's responsible regardless. However, the child's need for a father figure is a significant factor. The author's guilt suggests he knows there's a problem, but he's still firm in his decision. \n\nSo, considering all angles, I think the author is in the wrong. He has a responsibility towards his child, and by not being involved, he's causing harm to the child. Even if the circumstances were not ideal, the child deserves a relationship with both parents. The answer would be A.\n"
