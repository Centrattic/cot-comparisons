C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with his pregnant girlfriend is in the wrong. The situation is pretty complex, so I need to break it down carefully.\n\nFirst, the guy had a 3-year high school relationship with C. She had a tough childhood, with a father who abandoned her and a mother who committed suicide. She was raised by devout Catholic grandparents and developed bipolar disorder, which caused mood swings. She wanted to get married and have a family, but he wasn't interested in marriage. He thought he was in a monogamous relationship, and they had sex without using condoms because she was on oral contraceptives. She later got diagnosed with PCOS, which made her fear infertility. Despite that, she ended up pregnant and hid it. When confronted, she denied knowing, but he convinced her to get an abortion. However, on the day they were going to the airport for the abortion, her cat was run over, which they took as a sign from God to keep the baby. He then broke up with her, stopped being involved, and only pays child support. Now, their son is 5, and the son says \"my daddy doesn't play with me,\" which is making the guy feel guilty but he still stands by his decision.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants to know what I think. The options are A (yes, he's wrong) or B (no).\n\nHmm. Let's consider the key points. C had a mental health issue (bipolar) and a traumatic past. Her desire for a family might have been exacerbated by her mental state. She deceptively became pregnant, hid it, and even lied about knowing she was pregnant. He tried to convince her to abort, which she initially agreed to, but then changed her mind due to a \"miracle\" with the cat. He felt forced into a parenthood he wasn't ready for, so he broke up and cut contact.\n\nOn the other hand, once the child is born, he's legally and morally responsible in many societies. Withholding contact from the child could be harmful to the child's well-being. Even if he didn't want the child, the child's needs are separate. By paying child support but not being involved, he's providing financial support but not emotional or parental presence. The child's statement about not playing with the dad suggests emotional neglect, which is a problem.\n\nBut from the guy's perspective, he felt manipulated and not given a choice. He was in a relationship where the partner lied about pregnancy and then changed her mind. He might feel he's being forced into a role he never agreed to. However, breaking up and cutting ties entirely after the child is born could be seen as abandoning the child, which is a serious matter.\n\nLegally, in many places, you can't just disown a child you're responsible for. Morally, the child has the right to know both parents. The guy's stance might be understandable in terms of personal autonomy, but the child's welfare is a higher priority. So even if C was at fault for the deception, the guy's refusal to engage with the child could be considered wrong because it's the child who suffers.\n\nSo balancing both sides: C's actions were manipulative and harmful, but the guy's response is also harmful to the child. The question is whether the guy is in the wrong. If the answer hinges on the child's well-being, then he is in the wrong. If it's about autonomy and consent, maybe not. But society generally values the child's need for parents, so even if C was in the wrong, the guy's choice to cut off the child's relationship with him is problematic.\n\nTherefore, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because cutting off the child is harmful regardless of past events. But maybe B (not in the wrong) if focusing on the manipulation and lack of consent. However, most people would argue that the child's needs supersede the parent's grievances, so A.\n"
