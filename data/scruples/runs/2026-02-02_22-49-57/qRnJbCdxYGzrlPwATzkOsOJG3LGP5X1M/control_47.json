C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he broke up with his pregnant girlfriend, C, after she decided to keep the baby despite his insistence on an abortion. Now he's not involved in the child's life but pays child support. The question is whether he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author argues that he wasn't ready for a child and that he was deceived because C hid the pregnancy. He felt pressured into the abortion, but she changed her mind after the cat incident. He sees her as selfish for going against his wishes. On the other hand, people might think that once the child was born, he has a responsibility to be involved as a father.\n\nBut let's break it down. The author was in a relationship with C, and they were having sex without using condoms. He knew she was on birth control, but maybe he should have taken more precautions? The fact that she had Polycystic Ovary Syndrome and was worried about fertility might have affected her decision-making. But he didn't seem to take her concerns seriously, leading to the pregnancy.\n\nWhen she got pregnant, he tried to convince her to have an abortion. She went along with the plan but then at the last minute changed her mind because of a \"miracle\" with the cat. That seems like a big issue. The author feels wronged because he wasn't ready for a child and didn't want to be a father. However, he also left the situation and cut off contact. \n\nNow, the child is 5 years old and the author is not involved in his life. People are judging him for abandoning his child. The child is starting school and is already feeling the absence of his father. The author's parents are involved, but he's not. He says he feels guilty but still stands by his decision. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, he's paying child support, so he's fulfilling that obligation. But emotionally, he's not present. The question is whether that's morally wrong. The author might believe he had the right to refuse fatherhood since the pregnancy wasn't planned and he wasn't ready. But once the child is born, the responsibility shifts. Even if the father didn't want the child, the child has a right to a relationship with both parents. \n\nThe argument that C was selfish for wanting the child against his wishes is complex. However, the author also made a decision to leave, which affects the child's life. The deception about the pregnancy might be a point\u2014it's important in a relationship to communicate honestly about such matters. But C's mental health issues, including bipolar disorder, might have influenced her decisions. The author didn't take her mental health into account, maybe, and didn't support her in a healthy way when she was struggling with her desires for a family. \n\nHe might argue that he was wronged because he wasn't given a choice when the pregnancy happened. However, the reality is that he was part of the situation and now has a child. Choosing to not be part of the child's life could be seen as selfish as well. The fact that the child is expressing confusion about his father adds to the emotional weight of the situation. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, most people would view the father as having a responsibility to be involved, regardless of how the situation came about. So even if the author feels wronged, his current actions might be seen as neglecting his duty. The author's stance is firm, but the impact on the child is significant. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's decision to distance himself from his child might be viewed as morally wrong, despite his initial reasons. Therefore, the answer might be A (he is in the wrong). But I need to make sure I didn't miss any key points. The deception and his own responsibility in the pregnancy (not using condoms) are factors. Also, his current choice to not engage with the child affects the child's life, which is a strong point against him.\n"
