C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is about breaking up with a pregnant girlfriend who then had a child without the author's consent. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author was in a high school relationship that ended. The ex-girlfriend, C, had a difficult upbringing and mental health issues (bipolar disorder). She wanted a family but the author didn't. They had unprotected sex, she had a medical condition that made pregnancy less likely but she got pregnant anyway. The author tried to get her to have an abortion, but when the opportunity arose, she changed her mind because of a \"miracle\" with her cat, and the author broke up with her.\n\nNow, the author is not in contact with the child, pays child support, but people are judging him. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFrom the legal standpoint, in many places, fathers have financial responsibilities even if they didn't want the child. So paying child support is required. But the moral aspect is more complex. The author feels he was coerced into not getting an abortion, and that C was being selfish. However, C might have felt pressured or had her own reasons. The author's decision to cut off contact could be seen as neglectful, even if he wasn't ready. Children have a right to know their father, and the child's comment about not playing with the dad is a red flag.\n\nMentally, C had bipolar disorder. Did the author consider her mental health in the situation? She might have been manipulative, but her actions could be influenced by her conditions. The author might have been in a coercive situation where she tried to force him into parenthood.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't use protection, so he shares responsibility. Choosing to not be part of the child's life could be harmful to the child's development. Society often holds that parental responsibility includes being present, even if the father didn't want the child. The author's refusal to engage might be seen as selfish now, even if he felt wronged initially.\n\nBut there's also the argument that the author was not given a choice in the pregnancy outcome. The ultimatum was abortion or him, and she chose against his wishes. That could justify his decision to leave. However, as a father, he has ongoing responsibilities regardless of consent.\n\nSo, the answer isn't straightforward. Legally, he's doing his part with support, but morally, the lack of contact is problematic. The author might have valid reasons for feeling wronged, but the child's well-being is a separate issue. Given the societal norms and the child's needs, the author is likely seen as being in the wrong (A) because he's not engaging with his child despite the circumstances.\n"
