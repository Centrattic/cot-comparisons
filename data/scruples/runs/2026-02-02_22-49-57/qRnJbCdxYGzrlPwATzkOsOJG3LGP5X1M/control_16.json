C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author had a girlfriend named C who had a tough background. Her parents were absent or deceased, which probably affected her mental health. She has bipolar disorder, which might explain her erratic behavior. They were in a relationship for three years in high school, and C wanted to get married and have a family. The author didn't share that desire, so C became more aggressive about it. The two were sexually active without using condoms even though C was on birth control. Then C got diagnosed with PCOS, making her worried about her ability to conceive. \n\nLater, C ended up pregnant. The author found out and pressured her to have an abortion, even giving her an ultimatum: him or the baby. They were set to go get the abortion, but on the way, the cat was hit by the car, and C and her grandparents took it as a sign from God to keep the child. The author then broke up with her and hasn't been involved in the child's life, only paying child support. Now the child is five, and the child says he doesn't play with his daddy, making the author feel some guilt but still sticking to his decision.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Let's think about the key points here. \n\nFirst, the author claims he wasn't ready for a child and that C deceived him. However, they were in a relationship where he knew her desire to have a family, and they were having unprotected sex. Even if he thought the birth control was sufficient, the fact remains that they engaged in sexual activity without using additional protection, which carries a risk of pregnancy. So maybe he should have been more responsible, even if he didn't want kids yet.\n\nWhen C became pregnant, the author tried to convince her to have an abortion, which he might have considered the right choice for both of them. But when she decided to keep the child due to the \"miracle\" of the cat's death, he left her. The question is whether he's obligated to be a part of the child's life. Legally, he is the father and has to pay child support, but emotionally and socially, there's a debate. Some might argue that once you become a parent, you have a responsibility, even if the circumstances were unplanned. Others might say that if the mother acted deceptively to trap him into fatherhood, it's understandable he's reluctant.\n\nBut here's the catch: the child is innocent. The author is the biological father, and many would argue that a child has a right to know and be supported by both parents, regardless of the parents' past issues. The fact that the child is now saying, \"my daddy doesn't play with me,\" shows the impact of his absence. The author might be causing emotional harm, even if he feels wronged. \n\nAlso, the idea of \"deception\" is a key point. The author says C was deceptive in getting pregnant to fulfill her fantasy. However, if they were in a committed relationship and having sex without protection, the responsibility isn't entirely on C. The author also had a role in the situation. If the birth control failed, it's a shared risk. \n\nThe author's decision to cut off contact despite the child's existence could be seen as selfish, even if he feels wronged. While his feelings are valid, the child's well-being is a priority. Society generally expects parents to at least maintain some relationship with their child for the child's sake, even if the parents are no longer together. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions might be seen as wrong because he's choosing his feelings over the child's need for a relationship with a parent. Even if the situation is complex and the mother's actions were questionable, the father's choice to completely disengage is likely causing long-term harm to the child. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
