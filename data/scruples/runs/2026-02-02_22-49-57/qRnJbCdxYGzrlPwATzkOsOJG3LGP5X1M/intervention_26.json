C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. Let me start by breaking down the key points.\n\nFirst, the author had a long-term relationship with a girl named C. C had a tough background, including her parents' issues, which led her to be religious and have mental health challenges like bipolar disorder. The author wasn't interested in marriage or having kids, but C was determined. Even after being told she had a lower chance of conceiving due to PCOS, she became pregnant. The author found out later, asked for an abortion, and they were about to go through with it when the cat incident happened, leading C to believe it was a divine sign to keep the baby. The author then broke up with her and hasn't been involved in the child's life, though he pays child support. Now, he's being judged for this by people, including his family, and feels torn after hearing the child mention he doesn't play with him.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks he isn't, but I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nFrom the author's perspective: He wasn't ready for a child, and C withheld the pregnancy to force his hand. He felt he had no choice and that C was being selfish. He's paying child support, which shows some responsibility. However, he's refusing to have contact with his child, which is causing emotional harm. \n\nFrom C's side: She had a mental health condition that might affect her decision-making. The pregnancy was a significant life event, and even though she may have hidden it, she ended up carrying the child. The author broke up with her, which might have been a way to distance himself, but he's still the father biologically. \n\nLegally, he has responsibilities as a father, and cutting off contact without any effort to rebuild the relationship could be seen as neglectful. Emotionally, the child is suffering, which is a significant factor. However, the author's argument is that he wasn't given a choice and that C was manipulative. But once the child is born, his responsibilities as a father are a key point here.\n\nMoral considerations: Even if he didn't want the child, as a parent, he has a duty to be involved. The fact that he's paying child support but not engaging emotionally might be seen as not fulfilling his parental role. Also, the child's well-being is important, and the father's absence is affecting him.\n\nBut there's the argument that C's actions were deceptive, which adds complexity. However, the author could have chosen to be involved after the birth to some extent, even if he's not a present father. His refusal to validate C's actions might be a way to express his anger, but it's not helping the child.\n\nIn many places, child support is mandatory, but parental involvement is also encouraged. The author's stance could be seen as selfish now because the child needs a father figure, regardless of past circumstances.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the author is in the wrong now because once the child is born, the father has responsibilities beyond just financial support. Not engaging with the child's life, especially when the child is expressing a need for a father, is morally and ethically problematic. The initial decision might have been influenced by the circumstances, but the ongoing refusal to be part of the child's life is where he's at fault.\n"
