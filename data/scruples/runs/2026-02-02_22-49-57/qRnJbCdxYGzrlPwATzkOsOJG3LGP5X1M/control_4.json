C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given story is in the wrong. The story is about a man who broke up with his pregnant girlfriend after she decided to keep the baby instead of getting an abortion, which he had insisted on. The question is whether he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The woman, C, had a difficult background and mental health issues (bipolar disorder). The man wasn't interested in marriage or having kids. They were on birth control but didn't use condoms, leading to pregnancy. The woman was told she was less likely to conceive due to PCOS, which made her want a child even more. The man pressured her for an abortion, arranged travel, but then the cat was hit by the car on the way to the airport, which they saw as a sign from God. The man broke up with her, refuses contact, pays child support but not custody. Now the child is 5, and the son says \"my daddy doesn't play with me,\" making the man feel guilty but still firm in his decision.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to analyze both sides. From the author's perspective, he wasn't ready for a child and felt pressured by C's insistence. He tried to convince her to get an abortion, which she refused when the \"miracle\" happened. He feels he had no choice but to break up. From the other side, C is a mother, and the child deserves a relationship with the father. The man is paying child support but not engaging in a parental role, which could be seen as neglectful. The woman's mental health and manipulation (deceiving him about the pregnancy) are factors. But the man's decision to cut off contact despite the child's needs might be seen as selfish. \n\nLegally, he's paying support, so he's fulfilling that duty. Emotionally, the child is affected by his absence. The man's stance is based on his initial unwillingness, but children have rights too. The woman's actions were manipulative, but the man's refusal to engage now could be seen as harmful. The situation is complex with both parties making poor decisions. However, once the child is born, the father has responsibilities. Even if he didn't want the child, he's part of the child's life. So, while C's actions were problematic, the man's refusal to be involved could be considered wrong. The question is whether he's \"in the wrong.\" Societally, not engaging with your child is often viewed negatively, even if the child wasn't planned. So I think the answer is A (he's in the wrong) because, despite the circumstances, the child deserves a relationship with the father. The man's decision to cut contact harms the child, and he's responsible as a parent. However, there are mitigating factors with C's manipulation. But overall, the man's current stance is likely wrong.\n"
