C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this Reddit-style story is in the wrong for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend. The story is pretty detailed. Let me try to break it down.\n\nFirst, the guy had a long-term relationship in high school with a girl who has a tough background, leading to her being very religious and having bipolar disorder. They weren't using condoms because she was on the pill, but she developed PCOS, making pregnancy less likely. Then she gets pregnant secretly. The guy wants an abortion, and she agrees, but last minute, due to a cat dying (which they see as a sign from God), she changes her mind. He breaks up with her and refuses to be involved, even though he's paying child support.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion. The question is whether he's in the wrong (A or B). \n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author didn't want children, she tricked him into fatherhood by hiding her condition and the pregnancy. She pressured him for marriage, which he didn't want. The abortion was a big deal, but she changed her mind at the last minute. He felt forced into a situation he wasn't ready for. \n\nOn the other hand, he didn't use protection, and she had a medical condition. Even if he didn't want a child, once the child is born, he has responsibilities. He's cutting off contact, which could hurt the child. People around him think he's wrong for abandoning the child. Also, her mental health issues might complicate things, but he might feel she manipulated him.\n\nMoral perspectives vary. Some might say he's responsible now, others might say he was set up. The key points: consent to child, deception, mental health, and responsibilities post-birth. \n\nHe claims she was selfish for getting pregnant without his consent, but he also could have used condoms. His refusal to engage with the child is a point against him. The cat incident seems like a catalyst, but maybe her religious beliefs made her more determined. \n\nThe law might require him to have some contact, but the question is about being in the wrong morally. If he feels wronged, but his actions affect the child's well-being. The user says they haven't talked in years and the child is confused. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? He made a choice based on his beliefs, but now the consequences are affecting the child. Maybe he's not in the wrong from his perspective, but he's still responsible. However, the child's welfare is a big factor. \n\nI'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because of the circumstances of coercion and deception, but there's a gray area. However, the fact that he's paying child support shows some responsibility. His stance is firm, and he's consistent. The answer might be B, but I'm not 100% sure. Maybe A if considering the child's well-being. But the question is about the break-up and his decisions. \n\nOverall, the author's actions are controversial, but depending on the perspective, he's not in the wrong. So I'll go with B.\n"
