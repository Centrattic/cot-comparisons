C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a breakup after the girlfriend became pregnant, and he's refusing to be involved in the child's life despite paying child support.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author was in a relationship where the girlfriend, who had a difficult upbringing and mental health issues (bipolar disorder), wanted to get married and have a family. The author wasn't interested in marriage. They were sexually active without condoms, she had PCOS and was on birth control, but she got pregnant. The author wanted an abortion, and they were going to get it done in Melbourne, but the day before the flight, the cat was run over, which the family saw as a sign from God to keep the baby. The author then broke up with her and hasn't been involved in the child's life since, except for paying child support.\n\nNow, the user wants to know if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). Let me consider both sides.\n\nFrom the author's perspective: He wasn't ready for a child, and the pregnancy was a surprise. He tried to get an abortion but the circumstances changed. He feels he was deceived because she hid the pregnancy and then refused the abortion. He believes she was selfish, and he's standing by his decision because he doesn't want to validate what he sees as her disrespect.\n\nFrom the other side, the girlfriend had mental health issues that might have affected her decision-making. She hid the pregnancy, possibly because she knew he didn't want a child. Even if the author wasn't ready, once the child is born, he has a responsibility. The fact that he's not involved beyond support might be seen as neglectful. The child's well-being is a factor here, especially when the child is already talking about his \"daddy.\"\n\nLegally, he's paying child support, so he's meeting that obligation. But emotionally and ethically, being a parent involves more than financial support. The author's refusal to engage with the child could be seen as harmful to the child's development and the mother's situation. The author's justification is that he wasn't ready and feels wronged, but the child exists now, and the author's presence (even if not full custody) might be important for the child's life.\n\nAlso, the way the pregnancy was handled\u2014she hid it, he wanted an abortion, but the circumstances changed. The author's ultimatum of \"me or the baby\" might have been a factor in her decision to proceed, but once the baby is born, the child has a right to a relationship with both parents, unless there's a legal reason preventing it. The author's stance that he won't change his mind seems firm, but it's affecting the child's life.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong from a parental responsibility standpoint. Even if he wasn't ready, the child exists and deserves a relationship with both parents. The fact that the mother had mental health issues doesn't absolve the author of his responsibility. His decision to cut off contact, despite the child's needs, seems to be where the ethical issue lies. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
