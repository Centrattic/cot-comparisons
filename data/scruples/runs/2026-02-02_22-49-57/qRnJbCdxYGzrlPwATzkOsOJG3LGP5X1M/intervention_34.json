C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend after she secretly got pregnant despite having polycystic ovary syndrome, which made conception less likely. He convinced her to get an abortion, but then a cat was run over, leading her to believe it was a miracle from God and she changed her mind. He ended the relationship and hasn't been involved with the child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, he's paying child support, which is his responsibility. Ethically, the situation is more complex. The woman had a history of mental health issues, including bipolar disorder, which might have affected her decision-making. She also came from a traumatic background, which could influence her actions. However, she did deceive him about the pregnancy, which is a significant factor.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he wasn't ready for a child and felt disrespected by her actions. He had no intention of having a child and she went against his wishes by continuing the pregnancy. But on the other hand, by continuing the pregnancy, she became the mother, and he has a responsibility as the father, even if he doesn't want to be involved. His decision to cut off contact might be seen as selfish, especially as the child is growing up without a father figure.\n\nThe cat incident is a key point. It's a tragic coincidence, but using it as a sign from God to keep the child seems like it's influenced by her religious beliefs and mental health. The author feels she was selfish, but she might have been acting on deep-seated needs and trauma.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, even if he wasn't ready, the child is now part of the world. His refusal to engage could harm the child's well-being. But he might feel it's the only way to maintain his boundaries after feeling betrayed. However, most people would argue that a child deserves both parents, even if the relationship is broken.\n\nThe author's actions have consequences beyond his immediate feelings. The child's emotional development is affected by not having a relationship with the father. The author might be in the wrong for not taking responsibility beyond financial support. But it's also a very personal and painful situation for both parties.\n\nConsidering all angles, while the woman's actions were deceptive and possibly influenced by her mental health, the author's refusal to engage with the child despite being the biological father might make him at fault. The balance between personal autonomy and parental responsibility is tricky, but societal expectations often lean towards involvement. So, maybe the answer is A, he's in the wrong.\n"
