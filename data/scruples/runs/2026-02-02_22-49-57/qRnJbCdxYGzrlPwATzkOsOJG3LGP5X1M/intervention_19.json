C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user wants to know if the author of this situation is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the scenario again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author broke up with his pregnant girlfriend, C. They were in a high school relationship, and C has a tough background with a lot of trauma. She's religious and has bipolar disorder. They had a relationship where they were sexually active without condoms, and C was on birth control. Then she got diagnosed with PCOS, which made her fear infertility even more. She got pregnant, but hid it, then the author convinced her to get an abortion. But on the day they were going to the airport, the cat got hit by the car, and C saw it as a sign from God to keep the baby. The author ended up breaking up with her after she changed her mind. Now, the child is 5, and the author is paying child support but has no contact. He feels guilty when he hears the child say his dad doesn't play with him, but he's still firm in his decision because he feels C was selfish and deceptive.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants my take. I need to decide if it's A (he's wrong) or B (not wrong).\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The author didn't want children and C knew that. However, C manipulated the situation by getting pregnant and hiding it. The author tried to get her to have an abortion, which she initially agreed to, but then changed her mind due to what she believed was a divine sign. The author felt betrayed and ended the relationship. Now, he's not involved in the child's life but is paying support.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the author is obligated to support the child financially, but emotionally and ethically, it's more complex. The question is about moral responsibility. The author argues that C was selfish and deceived him. C might argue that she was acting in the best interest of the child and her beliefs. The author's refusal to engage with the child could be seen as neglectful, especially as the child is starting to form attachments and the father's absence is affecting him.\n\nHowever, the author's perspective is that he was coerced into an unwanted pregnancy through deception. If C was honest from the start, maybe the situation would have been different. But given that the author was already in a committed relationship and was having unprotected sex with someone on birth control, there's a level of responsibility there too. The cat incident seems like a catalyst that made C change her mind, which might have been out of the author's control.\n\nOn the other hand, once the child is born, the author has a responsibility as a parent, regardless of how the pregnancy came about. Choosing not to have any contact with the child could be seen as abdicating that responsibility. Even if the author feels wronged, the child is innocent in all of this. The author might be holding onto resentment towards C, which is affecting their child.\n\nSo, in terms of being \"in the wrong,\" it's a nuanced situation. The author's actions led to a child being born without his consent, but once the child exists, the author has a duty. The fact that he pays child support shows some level of responsibility, but not engaging emotionally or spending time with the child is a different issue. The child's well-being should be a priority, and the author's refusal to connect despite the child's confusion and hurt could be seen as morally wrong.\n\nHowever, the user's initial thought is that the author isn't in the wrong. The user might see the deception as the main issue and the author's right to autonomy. But in many societies, parental responsibility is seen as a duty, regardless of the circumstances. So, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong because he's neglecting his parental duties despite his initial feelings. But I need to weigh both sides carefully.\n"
