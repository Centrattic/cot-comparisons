C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong. The situation is pretty complicated.\n\nFirst, the author broke up with his pregnant girlfriend, C, after her family refused to have an abortion due to a \"miracle\" with a cat. He's been paying child support but hasn't been in contact with his son. Now, he's feeling conflicted because his son mentions not having a dad, but he's still firm on not changing his decision.\n\nI need to consider the legal and ethical sides. Legally, he's paying support, which is the right thing. But emotionally and ethically, it's a different story. The argument against him is that a child has a right to a relationship with both parents, and cutting off contact could be harmful. On the other hand, he claims he was not ready, felt pressured, and that C was being selfish. He might feel that forcing him to be a father against his will is unfair, especially if he wasn't in the picture during conception.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of responsibility. Even if he didn't want the child, the child is now part of his life. Withholding involvement could affect the child's well-being. The mother's actions were dishonest, but as a father, he has a role to play. Maybe the author's stance is hurting the child more than the mother's actions. The fact that the child is expressing a desire for his father's presence might indicate that the author's decision is causing more harm now.\n\nOn the other hand, the author felt coerced and manipulated by C. He had no say in the matter, and the pregnancy was kept secret. That's a significant point. However, once the child is born, the legal and social responsibilities kick in. The author is maintaining financial support but not emotional, which could be seen as neglecting the child's emotional needs.\n\nI'm torn. The author's initial decision might stem from being pressured and deceived, but the ongoing lack of contact could be harmful. The question is whether he's in the wrong now. The law might not side against him, but morally, society might expect him to engage. The child's well-being is a key factor here. The author's guilt over the child's comment suggests he's aware of the emotional impact. So, while he might not be legally wrong, ethically, he could be in the wrong for not being involved. So, the answer is A\u2014yes, he's in the wrong.\n"
