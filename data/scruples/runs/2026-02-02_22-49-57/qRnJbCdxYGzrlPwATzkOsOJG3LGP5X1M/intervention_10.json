C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend, C, and not getting involved in the child's life. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author had a 3-year relationship in high school with C, who has a difficult background and bipolar disorder. They were in a relationship where the author wasn't interested in getting married, but C wanted a family. They had unprotected sex, and C was on birth control. Then she was diagnosed with PCOS, which made her worried about her fertility. Despite this, she got pregnant, hid it, and when confronted, she denied knowing. The author tried to convince her to get an abortion, but after she almost went through with it, the cat dying made her change her mind. The author then broke up with her and hasn't been involved in the child's life, though he pays child support. Now, the child is asking about his absent father, and the author feels guilty but stands by his decision.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to evaluate the ethics and morality here. The key points are consent, responsibility, mental health, and the impact on the child. \n\nThe author argues that C deceived him by hiding the pregnancy and then changing her mind about the abortion. He wasn't ready for a child and felt that C was acting selfishly. However, by having a child, he now has responsibilities. In many places, child support is a legal obligation regardless of the circumstances. The author's decision not to have contact with the child might be seen as neglectful, even if he's paying support. \n\nC's actions might be questionable\u2014deception and possibly manipulative behavior to get the child. However, once the child exists, the author's responsibility as a parent could be considered a duty, even if he didn't want the child from the start. The child now has a right to a relationship with their father, and the author's refusal to engage might be harming the child. \n\nMoral perspectives vary. Some might argue that the author is right in not wanting to be a parent and standing by his decision, especially if he believes the pregnancy was a result of deception. Others might say that once a child is born, the parent must take responsibility for their role, regardless of the circumstances. The author's guilt and the child's emotional needs are factors. \n\nLegally, the author is fulfilling his duty by paying child support, but emotionally and ethically, the absence might be harmful. The child's comment about the dad not playing with him shows the impact. \n\nThe author's stance is firm, but the situation is complex. Both parties made decisions that have lasting consequences. The author's responsibility isn't just financial\u2014he's part of the child's life now. \n\nIn conclusion, while there are arguments on both sides, the fact that the child exists and the author's role as a parent might mean he's in the wrong for cutting off contact entirely, despite his reasons. The answer might be A (yes), but I need to be careful here. The user initially thought the author wasn't in the wrong, but the ethical duty to the child suggests otherwise.\n"
