C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he broke up with his pregnant girlfriend, who later had their child, and he hasn't really been involved. The main points to consider are his actions and the reasons behind them.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend had a rough past and mental health issues (bipolar disorder). She was pushing for marriage and family, which he wasn't interested in. They were using contraception but not condoms, and she developed PCOS, making pregnancy harder. Then she got pregnant, hid it, and when he found out, he pressured her for an abortion. They were about to go get it done, but the cat incident made her change her mind, and he broke up with her. Now he's not involved in the child's life, even though he pays child support.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. Did he have a responsibility to stay involved? Well, biologically he's the father, but he wasn't ready for parenthood. The girlfriend might have deceived him by hiding the pregnancy and lying about her intentions. However, once the child is born, does he have a duty to be part of the child's life? Even if he doesn't want to be a parent, the child has a right to know their father. Also, his parents are involved, which might help, but he's the biological father. \n\nBut then, he was pressured into an abortion, which she refused at the last minute. That's a big deal. She manipulated the situation by hiding the pregnancy, which he might not have known about. But once the child is born, cutting off completely might be seen as abandonment. Also, the child is now 5 and is being affected by his absence. The author feels guilt but still doesn't want to change his stance.\n\nLegally, he's paying child support, so he's fulfilling some responsibilities. But emotionally and ethically, is it right to not engage? The girlfriend's actions were selfish in a way by getting pregnant against his wishes, but the author's refusal to be involved also seems selfish. Both have valid points. However, the child's well-being is a factor. The author's parents are involved, but the child needs a father figure. The author's stance might be seen as wrong because once the child exists, he has a responsibility. But he wasn't given a choice initially. It's a tough call. \n\nIn terms of societal judgment, many see his lack of contact as immoral. But he argues he was wronged. The key points are consent and responsibility. If the pregnancy was a result of deception, maybe he's not entirely at fault. But once the child is born, the father has a role. So, while his actions have some justification, the complete disengagement from the child might make him at fault. So, likely the answer is A (he is in the wrong).\n"
