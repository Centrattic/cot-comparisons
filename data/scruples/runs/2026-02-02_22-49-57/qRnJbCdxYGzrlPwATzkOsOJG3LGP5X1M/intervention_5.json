C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author broke up with his girlfriend when she was pregnant. The girlfriend had a traumatic past and a strong desire to have a family, which led her to get pregnant, even though the author wasn't ready for a child. They argued about marriage and family, and the author was using her oral contraceptives, so the pregnancy was unexpected. He convinced her to get an abortion, but then a car accident involving her cat made her decide to keep the baby. The author then broke up with her and hasn't been involved with the child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the author's perspective. He claims he wasn't ready for a child and that the girlfriend was being selfish by getting pregnant without his consent. He felt deceived because she hid her pregnancy and changed her mind about the abortion. He's paying child support but hasn't been actively involved. He feels wronged and stuck in a situation he didn't choose. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend has a history of mental health issues (bipolar disorder) and a difficult upbringing. Her wanting a family so badly might be tied to her personal struggles. She did hide the pregnancy, which is significant because it's a major life decision that affects both parties. However, once the child is born, the author's responsibility as a father is a legal and ethical consideration. Cutting off contact with the child might be harmful to the child's well-being, even if the author isn't in a relationship with the mother anymore.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the author is still the biological father and has responsibilities towards the child. Emotionally, the child is growing up without a father figure. The author's parents do interact with the child, which might help, but it's not the same as having both parents involved. \n\nThe author's argument is that he wasn't ready and was deceived, but the girlfriend's actions led to a situation where she became pregnant, and now the author is choosing not to be a father. The key points here are consent in having a child, mental health factors, and the impact on the child. \n\nHowever, once the child is born, the author's decision to not be involved could be seen as neglecting his parental duties, regardless of his feelings towards the mother. While the girlfriend might have acted selfishly by hiding the pregnancy and changing her mind about the abortion, the author's refusal to engage with the child could be seen as selfish in return. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, many would argue that a child deserves both parents' love and presence if possible. The author's stance might be legally defensible in terms of not being in a relationship, but ethically, it's questionable. His guilt over the child's comment suggests some internal conflict, but he remains resolute. \n\nConsidering all this, it's a complex situation. The author might have valid reasons for feeling wronged, but the child's well-being is a critical factor. The answer could hinge on whether one prioritizes the author's autonomy or the child's right to a relationship with both parents. Given that the author is paying child support but not engaging, it's a middle ground but still leaves the child without a father figure. \n\nI think the author is in the wrong because, despite the circumstances, a child deserves a father's presence. The author's decision to cut off contact, even after acknowledging some guilt, might be seen as harmful to the child's development. The girlfriend's actions were problematic, but the author's current stance lacks consideration for the child's needs beyond financial support.\n"
