C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is he broke up with his pregnant girlfriend after she had an abortion that didn't happen because of some incident with a cat. He's been paying child support but hasn't been involved with the child. People are judging him.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author's main argument is that he wasn't ready for a child, and the girlfriend was being selfish by getting pregnant without his agreement. He tried to get an abortion, but she changed her mind after the \"miracle\" with the cat. He feels she tricked him into having a child he didn't want. \n\nBut on the other hand, once the child was born, he's the legal father, so he has responsibilities. Even if the pregnancy was a result of deception, once the child exists, cutting off completely might be seen as neglectful. He's paying child support, which is good, but not being involved in the child's life could be seen as morally wrong, especially when the child is expressing a desire for a relationship with him.\n\nThe girlfriend had mental health issues, which might have influenced her decisions, but that doesn't excuse her actions. However, the author's refusal to engage with his son and the way he's handling the situation could be seen as selfish too. He's not allowing the child to have a relationship with him, which might be harmful in the long run.\n\nThere's also the aspect of consent. He had sex without using condoms, which contributed to the pregnancy. Even if the girlfriend was deceptive, he shares some responsibility. But the key is whether he's in the wrong for not involving himself now. Legally, he's doing what's required (child support), but morally, many would argue that a father has a duty to be present, even if the circumstances were difficult.\n\nThe fact that the child says \"my daddy doesn't play with me\" is a strong indicator that the child is missing him, and the author's guilt suggests he knows this. But he's stuck in a position where he feels it's too late to change his mind. However, the child's well-being might outweigh his personal feelings here.\n\nSo, balancing all these factors, it's a complex situation. The author made decisions based on his own desires and the circumstances at the time, but once the child was born, his responsibility as a father comes into play. His current stance of not engaging could be seen as neglectful. Therefore, the answer might be that he is in the wrong (A), because despite his reasons, the child deserves a relationship with both parents, and his refusal to be involved is harmful.\n"
