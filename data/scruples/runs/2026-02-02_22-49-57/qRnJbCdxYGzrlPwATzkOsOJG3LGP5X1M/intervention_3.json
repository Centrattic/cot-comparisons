C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend and refusing to be involved in the child's life. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation from both sides. The author was in a high school relationship that ended. The girlfriend, C, had a tough upbringing and mental health issues (bipolar disorder). She wanted to get married and have kids, but the author wasn't interested. They had unprotected sex, and she ended up with PCOS, which made conception harder. Then she got pregnant but hid it. The author convinced her to get an abortion, but on the day of the procedure, her cat was hit by her grandparents' car, which they took as a sign from God to keep the child. The author then broke up with her, didn't participate in the child's life, and hasn't had much contact. Now he's conflicted because he feels guilty when hearing his son say his dad doesn't play with him, but he still stands by his decision.\n\nSo, the author is arguing that C was selfish for getting pregnant without his consent and then using a \"miraculous\" event to keep the child. He wasn't ready for parenthood. But others are judging him for abandoning his child. \n\nI need to consider the legal and ethical perspectives. Legally, in many places, a man is considered the legal parent if he's on the birth certificate or if he's been providing child support. So refusing contact might have legal implications. Ethically, the child has a right to know their father, especially as they grow older. The author is providing financially but not emotionally. \n\nFrom C's side, she had mental health issues and a traumatic background. She might have felt pressured or manipulated by her grandparents' religious beliefs when the cat was hit. She might have been in denial or not fully understanding the consequences. But she was pregnant and chose to continue the pregnancy against the author's wishes. \n\nThe author's stance is that he wasn't given a choice. However, once the child was born, he became a legal parent. His refusal to engage is impacting the child's life. The child's statement about not playing with his dad suggests emotional harm. \n\nThe author's argument is that C was selfish, but his decision to not be part of the child's life is also selfish in a way. Children need both parents, ideally. Even if the relationship with C ended, the child deserves a relationship with the father. \n\nLegally, in many jurisdictions, a non-custodial parent is still expected to maintain a relationship unless there's a court order restricting it. The author's actions might be seen as neglecting his parental responsibilities beyond financial support. \n\nSo, while the author might feel wronged initially, his ongoing decision to not be part of the child's life could be seen as wrong. The child's well-being is a key factor here. Even if the author wasn't ready for parenthood, the child has a right to a relationship with both parents, assuming it's safe. The author's guilt is a sign that his decision is causing him internal conflict, which might indicate a moral dilemma. \n\nIn conclusion, while the situation is complex, the author's refusal to engage with his child despite his ability to do so might be considered wrong from a societal and ethical standpoint, even if he feels justified.\n"
