C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend. The situation involves a lot of emotional and ethical considerations.\n\nFirst, the author and his girlfriend were in a high school relationship, five years long. She had a difficult upbringing with a father who abandoned her and a mother who committed suicide. Her grandparents are devout Catholics, which influenced her religion and possibly her views on family. She has bipolar disorder, which might have affected her decision-making. They were not using condoms, and she was on oral contraceptives. Then she was diagnosed with PCOS, which made her fear infertility, leading to emotional strain. The author eventually convinced her to get an abortion, but on the day they were going, her cat was hit by the car, which they took as a sign from God to keep the child. The author then broke up with her, hasn't had contact since, but pays child support. Now the child is five and has mentioned his daddy doesn't play with him, making the author feel guilty but still not change his stance.\n\nHmm, the key points here are around consent to parenthood, the girlfriend's mental health, the deception involved, and the author's current stance. The author claims he wasn't ready for a child and that she deceived him. But wait, they were sexually active without condoms, so the author might have known the risks. However, she was on birth control. The abortion was attempted, but the cat incident made her change her mind. The author then broke up, which he justifies as her being selfish. Now, he refuses to have contact, despite the child's mention of him.\n\nLegally, he pays child support, which is correct. But ethically? Parental responsibility isn't just financial. The child is starting school and forming his understanding of family. The author's lack of presence could be harmful. However, he was not in agreement with the pregnancy and felt forced. The girlfriend's actions might have been impulsive, especially with her mental health. But the author also didn't use protection, and even if she was on birth control, it's not 100% effective. He might have shared some responsibility.\n\nThe cat being run over\u2014whether that was a coincidence or not. The girlfriend's grandparents' influence and her own mental state could have played a role in her sudden change of heart. The author was convinced to go through the abortion but then the event made her rethink. Did the author take into account her mental health and the pressure from her family? Maybe he could have tried to support her more, especially if she was struggling with her mental health. But he also says he was given an ultimatum and that she was being selfish. The moral dilemma here is tough. On one hand, he didn't want a child and was wronged by her actions. On the other, the child now lacks a father figure. The author feels guilty but is firm in his decision. \n\nMost people might see the father's responsibility even if the child was an accident. But the circumstances of the pregnancy being a result of deception and lack of consent complicate things. It's a mix of personal choice, mental health, and societal expectations. The author's actions might be seen as abandonment, but he's not the biological mother. However, he is the father. The child needs both parents, especially in terms of emotional support. The author's refusal to engage could be impacting the child's development. So, even if he wasn't ready, once the child was born, maybe he should have found a way to be involved. But the initial breakup after the cat incident\u2014was that justified? It's hard to say. \n\nThe girlfriend's behavior was manipulative, but the author also didn't use protection. The line between personal autonomy and parental responsibility is blurry here. From an ethical standpoint, the author is in a position where he has a duty to his child regardless of his initial feelings. So, even if he was wronged, not maintaining a relationship with the child might be the wrong choice. Therefore, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong.\n"
