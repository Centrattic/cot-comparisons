C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he broke up with his pregnant girlfriend, who later had their child but he doesn't have contact with the child. First, I need to look at the facts.\n\nThe author mentions that his ex-girlfriend, C, had a tough upbringing, which led to her being very religious and having mental health issues (bipolar disorder, which he didn't realize at the time). She wanted to get married and have a family, but he wasn't interested in marriage. They were using birth control but had unprotected sex, leading to a pregnancy. He wanted an abortion, but she changed her mind after a \"miracle\" with her cat. He broke up with her after she refused to go through with the abortion.\n\nNow, the main question is whether he's in the wrong. From the perspective of legal and social norms, once a child is born, the father usually has responsibilities. But the author isn't involved with the child, which people are judging him for. He's paying child support, which is legally required, but he's not engaging emotionally or in the child's life. \n\nOn one hand, he argues that he was forced into a situation he wasn't ready for, and he felt deceived because she hid the pregnancy. He might believe that he had no choice when she changed her mind about the abortion. However, once the child is born, his responsibility as a parent isn't optional. Even if he didn't want the child, cutting off contact entirely is problematic. Children have a right to know and be connected with both parents, unless there's a valid reason for not being involved (like abuse, but that's not mentioned here).\n\nThe ex's mental health and Catholic beliefs might play a role. Her mental health could affect decision-making, but that doesn't excuse her actions if she manipulated him. However, his decision to cut off the child is a matter of ethics. While he has the right to not be a parent if the mother is the one raising the child, completely cutting off the child from the father's side can have emotional consequences, as seen with the child saying he doesn't have a daddy to play with.\n\nSo, the author is in a complicated situation. He had a conflict of wills regarding the pregnancy, but after the child is born, disengaging entirely might be seen as selfish. He's not the one with custody, but parental involvement is generally considered important for a child's well-being. Even if he feels wronged, his current stance is harming the child's life. Therefore, he might be in the wrong now because of the child's current emotional state and the lack of involvement, despite his initial conflict. The key is whether his stance is harming the child, which it appears to be.\n"
