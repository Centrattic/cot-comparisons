C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that they broke up with their pregnant girlfriend, and now they're getting a lot of criticism for not being involved with their child.\n\nFirst, let me recap the scenario. The author was in a 3-year high school relationship with a girl named C. C had a tough upbringing, with her father abandoning her and her mother committing suicide. Her grandparents are devout Catholics, and she became religious. C has bipolar disorder, which led to mood swings. Initially, she wanted to get married and have a family, but the author wasn't interested in marriage. When C found out she had PCOS, making it harder to conceive, she panicked. She later got pregnant without the author knowing, even though they were using birth control. The author found out and tried to get her to get an abortion. They were on their way to the airport for the procedure, but the cat got run over, which C's family saw as a miracle from God, so she decided to keep the baby. The author broke up with her, hasn't been involved, pays child support, and now feels guilty when the child mentions not having a daddy.\n\nThe author claims he was wronged because C was deceptive and selfish, and he wasn't ready for a child. He feels validated in his decision because she went against his wishes. The people around him think he's being selfish now for not being involved, but he doesn't want to change his mind.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. From a legal standpoint, he's paying child support, which is his responsibility. But emotionally and morally, is he at fault?\n\nOn one hand, the child is his, and he's choosing not to be involved despite the child's needs. The child is now 5 and is expressing that his daddy doesn't play with him. The author's parents are involved, which is good, but the child's relationship with the father is important. The author's reasons for not being involved stem from C's deception and his own unpreparedness. However, once the child was born, the author has a responsibility towards him, regardless of the circumstances. Even if he didn't want the child, the child is a separate person with his own rights. The author's refusal to engage might be impacting the child's emotional well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, C did deceive him by hiding the pregnancy and going against his wishes, especially after they had agreed on an abortion. The circumstances surrounding the cat incident leading her to change her mind might have been beyond the author's control. The author's argument is that he was coerced into a situation he wasn't prepared for, and C's actions were disrespectful. But does that justify cutting off the child? Even if the author feels wronged, the child is innocent and deserves a relationship with both parents, if possible.\n\nEthically, most societies value the relationship between a child and both parents, unless there are valid reasons for separation (like abuse, neglect, etc.). The author hasn't indicated any such issues. His refusal to be involved seems more about resentment towards C than the child's well-being. While he has a right to his feelings, the child's right to a father figure is also important. The author's actions might be seen as selfish because he's causing emotional harm to the child by his absence.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that he's firm in his decision and doesn't want to validate C's disrespect. However, the child's needs should be separate from any issues between the parents. The author's guilt when hearing the child's comment suggests he's conflicted, which might indicate he knows deep down that his actions are affecting the child negatively.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's decision to cut off the child might be seen as morally wrong, even if he feels wronged by C. The responsibility to the child goes beyond the parent's personal feelings. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
