C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. First, I need to look at the situation from both sides. The author broke up with his pregnant girlfriend after she decided to keep the child, and he refuses to be involved. Everyone around him thinks he's wrong, especially because of the child's comment about not playing with his daddy.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the author didn't want kids, his ex-girlfriend was mentally unstable with bipolar disorder, she was hiding her pregnancy, and there was an ultimatum about abortion. Then, when she decided to keep the baby after some incident with her cat, he left. Now he's avoiding contact with his son, even though he's paying child support.\n\nFrom the legal standpoint, he's doing the right thing by paying support, but emotionally and morally, he's not engaging with his child. The question is whether he's at fault. The user wants to know if he's in the wrong. \n\nOn one hand, he was pressured into a situation where he didn't want children, and the mother made decisions without his consent. His mental state and readiness are factors. But on the other hand, he's cutting off his child, which is harmful to the child's well-being. The child's comment shows that he's missing his father, so the author's refusal to be involved might be causing emotional distress.\n\nThe girlfriend had mental health issues, which complicates things. She might not have been in the best state to make decisions, and there's the aspect of consent. The author felt he had no say, but once the child is born, the father has responsibilities. Even if the father didn't want to be involved, he's still a parent. \n\nSo, from a societal and ethical perspective, it's generally expected that parents should be involved in their children's lives unless there are extreme circumstances. The author is choosing not to be part of his son's life, which could be seen as neglectful. His argument is that the mother was selfish and disrespectful, but that doesn't absolve him of his responsibilities. \n\nHe mentions that he was hurt and that he stands by his decision, but the child's well-being is paramount. The fact that he's causing emotional harm by not being present might make him at fault. Even if his reasons are valid, the result is a child without a father figure. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's situation is complex and he's not the perfect parent here, the primary responsibility to the child's needs might mean he's in the wrong for not being involved. The answer would likely be A, he's in the wrong, because the child's needs take precedence over his personal grievances.\n"
