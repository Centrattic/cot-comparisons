C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this about breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend is in the wrong. The author is seeking advice, similar to an AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post. The situation involves a high school relationship, a girlfriend with a difficult upbringing and bipolar disorder, and a pregnancy that led to a breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The author and C were in a 3-year relationship during high school. C wanted to get married and have kids, but the author wasn't interested in proposing. She had bipolar disorder, which might have affected her behavior. They used oral contraceptives but no condoms. Later, C was diagnosed with PCOS, which made her less likely to conceive, so she became obsessed with having a family. The author convinced her to get an abortion, but then the cat was hit by the car, leading her to believe it was a miracle from God. She changed her mind, decided to keep the baby, and the author broke up with her.\n\nNow, the author hasn't been in contact with the child but pays child support. People are judging him for abandoning the child. The child says his daddy doesn't play with him, which is making the author feel guilty. But he still believes he was wronged because he wasn't ready and she was selfish. \n\nI need to consider the ethical and moral implications here. The key points are consent to parenthood, the circumstances of the pregnancy, the author's right to refuse fatherhood, and the impact on the child. \n\nThe author's argument is that he wasn't ready to have a child and that C deceived him by hiding her pregnancy. But he was the father, and even if he didn't want the child, he's still responsible. In many places, a biological father has legal responsibilities regardless of the relationship status. The fact that he stopped contact doesn't negate his responsibility. However, from his perspective, he felt coerced into a situation he wasn't prepared for. But legally and socially, once a child is born, the father's responsibilities are established. \n\nThe author also mentions that C was being selfish by going against their previous agreement and the ultimatum. But the cat incident is a bit iffy. While it's a cultural belief, taking it as a divine sign might not be a strong reason to proceed with the pregnancy, especially if the author had made his stance clear. \n\nChild support is a legal obligation in many countries, so the author is fulfilling that. However, the emotional harm to the child and the mother's potential actions in hiding the pregnancy might also be factors. The author's refusal to be involved now could be seen as abandoning the child, even if he wasn't initially ready. \n\nMoral responsibility is a big part here. Even if he didn't want the child, the child is a result of their relationship. The author's decision might be influenced by the idea that C wasn't respecting his wishes, but once the child is born, the author's responsibility extends beyond the relationship. \n\nSo, in terms of being in the wrong, the author might be viewed as such because he's refusing to be part of his child's life despite the legal and moral obligations. However, there's nuance in that the pregnancy was hidden and he wasn't given a choice in the matter. But the fact that the child exists and he is the father probably means he has some responsibility. \n\nThe answer likely leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because while he had the right to not want a child, once it's born, he must take responsibility, even if his reasons are still valid. The deception by C is a factor, but not an excuse for him to disengage now.\n"
