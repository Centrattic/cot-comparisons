C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. \n\nSo, the author broke up with his pregnant girlfriend, C, after she had a cat run over on the way to the airport for the abortion. He was against continuing the pregnancy and wanted an abortion, but she decided to keep the child after the incident. Now, there's a child, N, and the author isn't involved. People are judging him for not being part of the child's life.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The author claims he wasn't ready for a child and that C was selfish by getting pregnant when he didn't want it. C had mental health issues (bipolar disorder) and a troubled past, which might affect her decisions. She also had a medical condition (PCOS) that made conception harder, so maybe she was desperate. \n\nHe says she deceived him by hiding the pregnancy and then changing her mind after the cat incident. But was she even aware of the pregnancy earlier? If she denied knowing until later, that's a factor. Also, the religious aspect: her grandparents and her Catholic beliefs influenced her decision, seeing the cat's death as a sign from God. \n\nNow, the author is cutting off contact with his child. Legally, he's paying child support, but emotionally, he's distant. The child is starting school and asking about his dad, which is hurting the author but also indicates the child's need for a father figure.\n\nMoral perspective: Every child has a right to know their father. The author's refusal to engage might be harmful to the child's well-being. But the author feels he was wronged initially. However, becoming a father is a life-changing event, and walking away entirely seems harsh. \n\nC's actions were wrong to lie about the pregnancy and make a unilateral decision to continue it, but the author's response of completely cutting off the child's life seems extreme. There might be a middle ground where he could be involved without a relationship with C. \n\nAlso, considering his parents are involved with the child, maybe there's a way to maintain contact without conflict. The author's stance that he wants to avoid validating C's disrespect doesn't seem like a good reason to neglect the child's needs.\n\nIn terms of ethics, parental responsibility usually includes some level of involvement. Even if the child's mother is at fault, the father has obligations. The author's guilt is evident when he hears the child's comment, but he's still not changing his position. That suggests he knows deep down he's causing harm to the child, even if he blames C.\n\nSo, weighing all that, the author is in the wrong for not being involved in his child's life despite the circumstances. He's the child's father, and the child has a right to a relationship with both parents. The initial situation is messy, but the current decision to avoid the child entirely is where the wrong lies.\n"
