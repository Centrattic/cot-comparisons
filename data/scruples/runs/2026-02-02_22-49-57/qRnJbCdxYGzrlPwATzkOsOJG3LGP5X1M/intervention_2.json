C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully again.\n\nHe was in a high school relationship with C for three years. C had a tough upbringing, her father abandoned her, her mother committed suicide, and she was raised by devoutly Catholic grandparents. She became religious and has bipolar disorder, which might have caused erratic moods. When the relationship started, C wanted marriage and a family, but the author wasn't interested. C got aggressive and argued, then gave up but they remained sexually active. The author didn't use condoms, and C was on birth control. After she got a diagnosis of PCOS, making pregnancy less likely, she still got pregnant. The author found out, convinced her to get an abortion, but the day they were going to the airport, her cat was hit by the car, and they took it as a sign from God not to proceed. The author broke up with her, and hasn't had much contact with the child since birth, though he pays child support. Now the child is 5, and the author is feeling guilt when he hears the child says his daddy doesn't play with him. He still thinks C was selfish in deceiving him into having the child when he didn't want it.\n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong. The question is to decide if the author is in the wrong, answer A for yes, B for no.\n\nFirst, let's consider the legal and ethical aspects. In most places, a man isn't legally obligated to be a father if he wasn't the one to decide to continue the pregnancy. However, once the child is born, there might be legal duties regarding child support. The author is paying child support, which is a responsible action legally. But the question is about moral wrong, not legal.\n\nMoral wrong: The author didn't want a child and tried to convince C to get an abortion. C went ahead with the pregnancy against his wishes. After the birth, he refuses to have contact, which is causing the child emotional pain. From a moral standpoint, even if the initial decision to have the child was against his wishes, once the child is born, the father has a responsibility to be involved. The child is starting school and needs a father figure. The author's decision to cut off contact might be seen as selfish now, but he feels justified because of the circumstances. \n\nC's actions: She was on birth control, but the author didn't use condoms, which he admits was his fault. However, she got pregnant and then tried to hide it. When he asked her to get an abortion, she initially agreed but then changed her mind because of the \"miracle\" with the cat. She might have been manipulative or acted on strong religious beliefs. But she was also dealing with PCOS and a history of trauma, which could have influenced her decision.\n\nThe author is in a difficult situation. He didn't want the child and felt coerced into the pregnancy by C's actions. However, once the child is born, the author has a responsibility towards the child. The child's well-being is a key factor here. The author's decision to not be involved might have been a reaction to feeling disrespected and manipulated, but the child's need for a father is important. \n\nIn many moral frameworks, the child's right to have a relationship with both parents is significant. The author's guilt is evident, but he's stuck in a position where he can't reverse his decision. However, not engaging with the child might be seen as abandoning the child, which is generally frowned upon. \n\nSo even though the author didn't want the child and felt that C was being selfish, once the child is born, the author has a moral obligation. Therefore, by not being part of the child's life, he might be in the wrong. But it's a complex situation. C's actions were manipulative, but the child is still part of his life. \n\nI think the answer leans towards A (yes, he is in the wrong) because once the child is born, the father has a responsibility regardless of how the pregnancy came about. However, some might argue B (no) because he wasn't the one who wanted the child, and C's actions were deceitful. But the child's well-being is a higher priority, so the author is in the wrong for not maintaining a relationship with his son.\n"
