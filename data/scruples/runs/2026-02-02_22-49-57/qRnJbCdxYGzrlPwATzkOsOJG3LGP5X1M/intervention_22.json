C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author had a relationship with a girl named C. They were in high school, and their relationship ended after five years. C had a tough upbringing with her father abandoning her and her mother committing suicide. She was raised by grandparents who were devout Catholics, which influenced her religious views. C has bipolar disorder, which caused erratic moods. At some point, C wanted to get married and have a family, but the author wasn't interested in proposing. She became more aggressive about it, leading to arguments. They were sexually active without using condoms, and she was on birth control. Then she was diagnosed with PCOS, making pregnancy less likely, but she still got pregnant.\n\nThe author wanted an abortion and gave her an ultimatum: him or the baby. They even booked a flight to Melbourne for the abortion. But then the cat got run over on the way to the airport, which C and her grandparents saw as a divine sign to keep the baby. The author then broke up with her. Now, the child is five, and the author hasn't been involved, only paying child support. He feels guilty when he hears the child mention not having a father, but he stands by his decision, believing C was selfish.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, in many places, a father's responsibility includes financial support, even if he's not involved. So the author is doing that, which is good. But emotionally and ethically, is he wrong for cutting off contact? The author argues that C deceived him by hiding the pregnancy and using the cat incident to change her mind. However, once the child is born, the father has responsibilities beyond just financial. The author's refusal to engage with the child could be seen as neglecting those responsibilities. \n\nOn the other hand, the author wasn't prepared for parenthood and felt forced into it. C's mental health issues, including bipolar disorder, might have affected her decision-making. The author might feel that he had no say in the matter once the abortion was aborted due to the cat incident. But once the child exists, does the father have a duty to be involved regardless of his initial intentions? \n\nThe author's stance is that he wasn't ready and that C was being selfish. However, the child is a human being with needs, and the father's absence is affecting the child's well-being. The author's guilt is evident, but he's still not changing his mind. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, some might say that the father is wrong because he's not taking responsibility beyond financial support. Others might argue that he was forced into a situation he didn't want and that the mother made decisions without his consent after the ultimatum. \n\nIt's a tough call. Legally, he's fulfilling part of his duty. Ethically, the emotional and psychological impact on the child and the father's own feelings of guilt complicate things. The mother's actions may have contributed to the situation, but the father's continued disengagement could be seen as harmful. \n\nI think there's a balance here. The author isn't entirely wrong because he didn't want a child and was in an ultimatum situation. However, his refusal to be involved in the child's life is where he might be at fault. So maybe A (he's in the wrong) because he's choosing not to take full responsibility for his child, even though his reasons are complex.\n"
