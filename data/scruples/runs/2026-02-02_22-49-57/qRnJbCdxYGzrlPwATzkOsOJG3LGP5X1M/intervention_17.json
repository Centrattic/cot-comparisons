C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author broke up with his pregnant girlfriend, who had a traumatic upbringing and mental health issues. They had been in a relationship for three years in high school. The girlfriend wanted to get married and have a family, but the author wasn't interested in marriage. She ended up getting pregnant, and the author convinced her to get an abortion, which she was about to do when the cat incident happened, leading her to change her mind. The author then broke up with her, refused to be involved in the child's life, and is now facing criticism for not being in their son's life. The user says they think the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both sides. The author's perspective is that he was not ready for a child, felt pressured by his ex-girlfriend's desire for a family, and felt deceived when she hid her pregnancy. He also cites her mental health issues and manipulation (like the cat incident being seen as a divine sign to keep the baby) as reasons for his decision. On the other hand, the girlfriend had a history of trauma and mental health challenges, which might have influenced her actions. The author's refusal to engage with the child, despite paying child support, is seen as neglectful by others, especially with the child now asking about his dad.\n\nLegally, the author is responsible for child support, so he's fulfilling that duty. Emotionally, he might be grappling with guilt, but he's also standing by his decision. Ethically, the question is whether he's morally obligated to be involved. Breaking up under these circumstances is a personal choice, but the ongoing disengagement from the child is where the conflict lies. The girlfriend's mental health and manipulation through the cat incident might be factors in the pregnancy decision, but the author is now the child's legal father. \n\nThe author's stance is that he wasn't ready for a child and felt it was forced upon him. However, once the child exists, there's a moral and societal expectation for the father to be involved. The author's choice to not participate, despite financial support, could be seen as neglecting the child's emotional needs. The child's comment about not playing with him adds to the ethical dilemma. \n\nBalancing the author's right to autonomy and the child's right to a father, it's a complex issue. While the author might feel wronged by the circumstances, the child's well-being is a significant factor. So, the answer likely leans towards AITA being the author, as his decision not to engage with the child could be considered neglectful, even if he feels justified. However, the girlfriend's manipulation and mental health are also factors. But given the child's needs, the author's decision might be seen as selfish now, making him at least partially at fault.\n"
