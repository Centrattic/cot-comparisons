C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend and not having contact with his child. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation from both sides. The author had a girlfriend, C, who had a tough past with family issues and mental health (bipolar disorder). They were in a high school relationship, and she had strong desires to have a family, which the author wasn't interested in. She ended up getting pregnant, but hid it. They were planning an abortion, but when they tried to go through with it, the cat incident happened, leading her to believe it was a miracle and she kept the baby. The author broke up with her and hasn't been involved with the child, N, even though he pays child support.\n\nNow, the key points here are: the author didn't want a child but didn't use protection, leading to pregnancy. He tried to convince her to have an abortion but she changed her mind after the cat incident. He broke up, maybe due to the conflict of values. Now the child is 5 and the author feels guilty but not ready to reconcile.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, he's paying child support, which is correct, but emotionally and socially, there's a lot to unpack. The question is about moral wrong. \n\nThe author might argue he wasn't ready, and she manipulated the situation by hiding the pregnancy. However, his responsibility as a parent is a big factor. Even if he didn't want the child, cutting off completely might be seen as neglectful. On the other hand, she went against his wishes by keeping the baby, which he felt was disrespectful.\n\nBut the child is a human being, and the father has a duty to be involved, regardless of the circumstances. His refusal to have contact could be seen as selfish now, especially since the child is growing up without a father. The mother's actions were unethical in hiding the pregnancy, but the father's response might be equally problematic in the long run.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for not being involved in his child's life, despite his initial reasons. His guilt and the child's well-being are important factors. So answer A: the author is in the wrong.\n"
