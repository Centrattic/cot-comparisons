C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he broke up with his pregnant girlfriend after she had a miscarriage of the abortion plan because of a cat incident. He feels like she was being selfish by pushing for the child against his wishes. But a lot of people are judging him for not being involved in his son's life.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the key points. The relationship was in high school, and the author was not interested in marriage or having kids. The girlfriend, C, had a lot of trauma in her past and was dealing with mental health issues (bipolar disorder). She was on birth control but they didn't use condoms. Then she got pregnant, and he wanted an abortion but she canceled it after a cat died, seeing it as a sign from God. The author broke up with her, hasn't been involved, but pays child support. Now the child is 5 and mentions not having a dad, causing the author guilt but he still stands by his decision.\n\nSo, from a legal standpoint, the author isn't the custodial parent and has been paying support, so he's meeting that obligation. But ethically, does he have a responsibility to be more involved? In many societies, there's an expectation for biological parents to have a relationship with their children, even if the relationship is strained. The author is choosing not to engage, which could be seen as neglecting the child's needs.\n\nOn the other hand, the author claims he wasn't ready for a child and felt coerced by his ex's actions. He felt deceived because she hid the pregnancy and then changed her mind about the abortion. He might believe that his mental well-being and readiness are important factors. However, the child is now 5, and the author's absence is affecting the child emotionally, as mentioned by his mother. The child saying \"my daddy doesn't play with me\" suggests a longing for a relationship, which the author might be denying.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, he's fulfilling his support duty, but morally, many might argue that being a parent involves more than just financial support. His ex's mental health and the circumstances of the pregnancy complicate things. However, the author's refusal to engage despite the child's age might be seen as selfish now, even if he felt wronged initially. The child's well-being is a significant factor here. So, even if the author felt he was wronged, the current impact on the child might make him partly responsible for the lack of relationship.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would likely be A, the author is in the wrong, because while his initial decision might have context, his ongoing disengagement is harming the child. However, there are nuances. But given the societal expectation and the child's emotional needs, it's more about the current situation rather than past actions.\n"
