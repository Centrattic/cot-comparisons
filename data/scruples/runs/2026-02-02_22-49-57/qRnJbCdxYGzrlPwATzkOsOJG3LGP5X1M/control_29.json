C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend and not being involved in his child's life. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author was in a high school relationship with C, who had a tough childhood and mental health issues (bipolar disorder). She wanted to get married and have a family, which the author wasn't interested in. They had unprotected sex because he wasn't using condoms, and she was on birth control, which later failed because she got PCOS. She got pregnant but hid it. When confronted, she denied knowing, then the author convinced her to get an abortion. But on the day they were going, the cat got hit by the car, which they saw as a sign from God to keep the baby. The author then broke up with her, didn't participate in the child's life, pays child support but no contact. Now the kid is 5 and says his daddy doesn't play with him, which makes the author feel guilty but he still stands by his decision.\n\nSo, the main points here are about consent and responsibility. The author argues that C deceived him by hiding the pregnancy and using PCOS to her advantage. He didn't want a child, and he felt forced into it. But on the other hand, he had unprotected sex with someone on birth control, which he acknowledges was his mistake. Also, once the pregnancy happened, he did try to get an abortion, but she changed her mind at the last minute because of the cat incident. \n\nNow, the ethical issues here are complex. The author didn't take responsibility for his role in not using protection, which contributed to the pregnancy. Even if the birth control failed, using condoms would have been a shared responsibility. Then, when the pregnancy was discovered, he tried to force her to have an abortion, which could be seen as pressuring her. But she had her own reasons, given her religious beliefs and mental health, to carry the child to term. \n\nThe author broke up with her, which might have been a way to distance himself from the situation, but by not being involved in the child's life, he's not fulfilling his parental responsibilities. Even if he didn't want the child, once a child is born, there are societal expectations about being a father. The child's well-being is affected by his absence, and the child's comment shows the emotional impact. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, he's paying child support, which is a duty, but emotional and social responsibilities are also important. The author's actions could be seen as abdicating his parental role. However, he was also in a situation where he felt manipulated and pressured by C's mental health and deception. But that doesn't absolve him of all responsibility. \n\nThere's a balance here between his right to autonomy and the child's right to a father. The author's stance is that he was wronged, but his current actions affect the child's life. The question is whether his decision to not be involved is morally wrong. \n\nConsidering all this, even though there are elements of the situation where C acted in a way that was manipulative (deception, mental health issues), the author's responsibility as a parent is significant. Not engaging with the child, despite paying support, might be seen as neglecting his duties. Therefore, he's likely in the wrong.\n"
