C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a breakup after a girlfriend, who has a history of mental health issues and a strong religious background, got pregnant despite using birth control. The author wanted an abortion, and when she refused after a \"miraculous\" cat incident, he broke up with her and hasn't been involved with the child.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The author's perspective is that he wasn't ready for a child, felt tricked because the girlfriend hid the pregnancy, and now feels stuck. The girlfriend's background includes trauma and mental health issues, which might have influenced her actions. \n\nLegally, in many places, the decision to have an abortion can be made by the pregnant person, so the author can't force that decision. But ethically, it's complicated. The fact that the author was using the girlfriend and her grandparents were involved in the abortion decision adds layers. The girlfriend's denial of knowing she was pregnant might be a red flag, but if she truly believed God wanted the child, maybe her mental state played a role.\n\nThe author chose not to be involved after the breakup, which affects the child's life. The recent comment from the child about not playing with the father is significant. Even if the author feels wronged, the child's well-being is a factor. The author's refusal to engage, despite paying child support, could be seen as neglecting parental responsibilities.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was pressured into a situation he wasn't prepared for. The girlfriend's deception and the mental health aspects might explain her actions. But as a parent, the author has responsibilities regardless of the circumstances. His guilt and the impact on the child suggest he might still have a role to play.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's decision not to be involved is causing harm to the child. Even if he feels wronged, the child's needs are paramount. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because he's not fulfilling his parental duties.\n"
