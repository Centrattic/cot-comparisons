C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about breaking up with a pregnant girlfriend after she changed her mind about an abortion because of a \"miracle\" with her cat.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author was in a relationship with C, who had a history of mental health issues, including bipolar disorder. They were not using protection, and C had a medical condition that made pregnancy less likely, but she still got pregnant. The author wanted an abortion, and they were about to go through with it when the cat died, leading C to believe it was a sign to keep the child. The author ended the relationship and hasn't been involved in the child's life, only paying child support. Now, he's feeling guilty but still stands by his decision.\n\nThe user's question is whether the author is in the wrong. The possible answers are A or B. The user thinks B (not in the wrong), but wants my opinion.\n\nI should consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, in many places, the decision to terminate a pregnancy can be a shared one, but ultimately the woman has the right to make that choice. However, once the pregnancy continues, the father does have some legal responsibilities. The author chose to distance himself after the abortion was aborted, which could be seen as abandoning the child, even if he wasn't ready. Ethically, it's a gray area. The author feels wronged because he wasn't consulted and she deceived him. However, C's decision to continue the pregnancy might be seen as her right, and the author's refusal to engage with the child could be considered neglectful.\n\nThe fact that the child is now 5 and the author hasn't had contact is significant. The child's comment about the daddy not playing with him adds emotional weight. The author's reasoning is that C was selfish for continuing the pregnancy against his wishes, but he's also being selfish by not being there for the child now.\n\nIn many cultures, there's an expectation that biological fathers take responsibility for their children, regardless of the circumstances. Even if the pregnancy was unplanned, the child is a result of both parties. The author's decision to not engage could be seen as morally wrong, even if he feels he had a right to his stance before the pregnancy was terminated.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that he was pressured into a situation he wasn't ready for, and C's mental health issues and deception (hiding the pregnancy) contributed to the situation. However, hiding the pregnancy is a serious issue, as it's a life-altering event. The author's responsibility doesn't end with the breakup; he's a parent now, whether he wants to be or not.\n\nSo, considering all angles, while the author might have valid reasons for his initial decision, his continued refusal to be part of his child's life could be seen as wrong. The child's well-being is a key factor here. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (in the wrong), but it's a complex situation. However, given the options, I think the answer is A.\n"
