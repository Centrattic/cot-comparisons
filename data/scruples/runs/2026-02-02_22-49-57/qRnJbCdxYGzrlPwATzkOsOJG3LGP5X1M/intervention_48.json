C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation they described. The story is pretty intense. So, the author broke up with his pregnant girlfriend after she got an abortion but then had the baby when the cat died, which she saw as a miracle. Now he's not involved with the kid and is paying child support but feels guilty when the kid says his dad doesn't play with him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and moral aspects. Legally, even if he didn't want the child, he's a parent, and there are obligations. But the main question is about being in the wrong morally. \n\nLooking at the author's perspective: he didn't want kids, she tricked him into getting pregnant and then changed her mind after the cat incident. He feels she was selfish. From his point of view, he was forced into a situation he didn't want. But then, he had the opportunity to accept the child but chose not to be involved. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend was clearly manipulative. She hid the pregnancy, then changed her decision after the cat's death. That's pretty deceitful. However, once the child is born, the author is still a parent. Withholding contact might harm the child. The child support is good, but emotional support is missing. \n\nThe author says he's not ready for a child, but once the child exists, his responsibility is ongoing. Even if he didn't want the child, the child is a person with rights. His decision to not be involved could be seen as neglecting the child's need for a father figure. \n\nThe user leans towards the author not being in the wrong, but I need to weigh both sides. The girlfriend's actions were definitely unethical, but the author's response of cutting off contact raises questions. He might be a victim of manipulation, but the child is the innocent party here. \n\nIn terms of societal judgment and morality, many would say that being a parent means being involved regardless of the circumstances. So, even if the author feels wronged, his choice to disengage might be considered morally wrong. The guilt the author feels when the child says \"my daddy doesn't play with me\" suggests internal conflict. \n\nSo, while the girlfriend was at fault for deception, the author's decision not to be part of the child's life could be seen as wrong. It's a tough call, but the child's well-being is a key factor here. I think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because despite the circumstances, the child needs a father figure, and the author is choosing to not be involved, which harms the child.\n"
