C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he broke up with his pregnant girlfriend, who he was in a relationship with 5 years ago. They ended up having a child, but he didn't want to be part of the child's life, and there's a lot of back and forth with the circumstances.\n\nFirst, let's look at the facts. The girlfriend, C, had a difficult upbringing and was dealing with bipolar disorder. She was very set on having a family, which the author wasn't interested in. They were using birth control but not condoms, leading to pregnancy. The author wanted an abortion, but she refused after a \"miracle\" with her cat, which they took as a sign from God. The author then broke up with her and hasn't been involved in the child's life beyond paying child support. Now the child is 5 and mentions not having a daddy, which is causing guilt but he's still firm in his decision.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the legal and moral obligations. Legally, he's paying child support, which he's required to do. But morally, is he responsible for being part of the child's life?\n\nFrom the user's perspective, he feels forced into parenthood because the woman was \"selfish\" in pursuing the pregnancy against his will. He argues that she deceived him by hiding the pregnancy and then refusing the abortion after he convinced her initially. The user is asking if he's at fault for not being involved.\n\nOn the other hand, the counterargument is that he became a father, and as such, has a responsibility to the child, regardless of the circumstances. The child has a right to know their father, and the author's decision to cut off contact could be seen as neglectful. The mother's actions might have been manipulative, but the author is now the legal father and has obligations.\n\nBut the author might argue that he was coerced into the pregnancy and that he wasn't ready. However, in many legal systems, once a child is born, the father has responsibilities even if the pregnancy was not consensual. The mother's actions here might be questionable, but the author's refusal to engage with the child is causing harm.\n\nAnother angle: the author's parents are involved with the child, which is positive, but the author's absence is causing emotional issues for the child. The child saying \"my daddy doesn't play with me\" suggests that the father's absence is affecting the child's well-being. That could be seen as morally wrong, regardless of the author's perspective.\n\nIn terms of consent, the author didn't consent to the pregnancy proceeding after the abortion was initially agreed upon. However, once the pregnancy continued, he became a legal father. The initial breakup was after the abortion was canceled, so he's not in the relationship anymore but still has a child.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's decision to cut off contact is causing harm to the child. Even if he feels wronged, the child has a right to a relationship with the father. So from a moral standpoint, the author is at fault for not being involved, despite the circumstances. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
