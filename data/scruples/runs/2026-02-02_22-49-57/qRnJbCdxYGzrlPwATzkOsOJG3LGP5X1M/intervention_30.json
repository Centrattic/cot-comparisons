C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend, C. The story is pretty detailed, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that C had a difficult upbringing with her parents' issues and became highly religious. She also has bipolar disorder, which might have influenced her behavior. They were in a high school relationship, and C wanted to get married and have a family. The author wasn't interested in proposing, leading to arguments. They were sexually active without using condoms despite C using birth control, which failed, leading to pregnancy. \n\nThen there's the part about Polycystic Ovary Syndrome making pregnancy less likely. C was hiding the pregnancy until it was too late for an abortion. The author convinced her to get one, but on the way to the airport with the cat dying as a sign, she changed her mind. The author broke up with her, refused to take part in the child's life, pays child support, but doesn't have contact. Now the son, N, is 5 and says his daddy doesn't play with him, causing guilt for the author but he still stands by his decision.\n\nThe user thinks the author is not wrong, but wants my take. So, considering both sides: C's actions were manipulative and deceptive, leading to an unwanted pregnancy. The author felt coerced into a situation he wasn't prepared for. However, once the child was born, he chose not to be involved, which raises ethical questions about parental responsibility.\n\nLegally, he's fulfilling obligations (child support), but emotionally and morally, is he in the wrong? The user's perspective is that the author was wronged, but societal judgment is on his side. The key here is consent and autonomy. C's actions led to pregnancy without his consent. But once the child exists, the author's refusal to engage might be seen as neglectful.\n\nThere's also the aspect of mental health\u2014C's bipolar disorder could have affected her judgment. But the author's lack of contact could be harmful to the child's well-being. While the author's initial decision might be understandable given the circumstances, the long-term consequences on the child's emotional state are significant. The guilt he feels now complicates things.\n\nIn terms of morality, some might argue that being a father requires responsibility regardless of the circumstances. Others might empathize with the author's position of not wanting a child. However, the child's right to know and have a relationship with both parents is a factor here. The answer hinges on balancing the author's autonomy and the child's welfare. I'm leaning towards the author being in the wrong now that the child is growing up, as his decision affects the child's life, not just his own.\n"
