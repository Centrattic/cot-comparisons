C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he broke up with his pregnant girlfriend after she decided to keep the baby despite his insistence on an abortion. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend had a difficult upbringing and mental health issues (bipolar disorder). The author mentions that their relationship was in high school, and she wanted to get married and have a family, which he wasn't interested in. They were sexually active without using condoms, and she was on birth control. But then she developed PCOS, which made her worried about fertility. Eventually, she got pregnant, hid it, and when confronted, denied knowing. The author convinced her to get an abortion, but then the cat was run over, which they saw as a sign from God to keep the child. He broke up with her after that and hasn't been involved in the child's life, only paying child support.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's look at the key points. Legally, in many places, a man isn't automatically a legal father unless he's married to the mother or has established paternity. But here, he might have signed the birth certificate or confirmed paternity, so he could be a legal father. If he is, then not being involved could have legal implications, but the question is about moral wrong.\n\nMoral perspective: The author didn't want children and wasn't ready. The girlfriend might have manipulated the situation to get what she wanted. However, once the child is born, the father has a responsibility, even if he didn't consent to the pregnancy. The argument is that the child is innocent and shouldn't suffer because of the parents' conflict. The author's refusal to have any contact, despite seeing the child a couple of times, and the child expressing that his dad doesn't play with him, shows a lack of parental involvement, which is concerning.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was deceived and pressured. The girlfriend lied about the pregnancy and then went against the agreed-upon plan (abortion) because of a superstitious event. He could argue that he was wronged by her deceit. But once the child is born, cutting off all contact might be seen as selfish, as the child has a right to know their father. The author's stance that he's not ready could be valid, but the child's well-being is also a factor.\n\nThere's a balance between personal autonomy and parental responsibility. The author didn't want the child and was coerced into the situation by the girlfriend's actions. However, once the child is born, the father's responsibility isn't just legal but also emotional and social. The child's need for a father figure is important, and the author's refusal to engage, even to the point of the child feeling neglected, may cause harm.\n\nSo, while the author has a valid point about being wronged, the consequences of his actions on the child's life might make him morally at fault. The fact that he's paying child support financially but not emotionally is a point against him. The community and family judging him for abandoning the child is a societal perspective that often emphasizes responsibility. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong, even if the girlfriend's actions were deceptive.\n"
