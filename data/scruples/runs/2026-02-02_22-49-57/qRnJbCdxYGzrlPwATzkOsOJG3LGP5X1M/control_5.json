C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is he broke up with his pregnant girlfriend after she went through with the pregnancy instead of getting an abortion, which he had insisted on. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the facts. The girlfriend, C, had a hard past with her parents abandoning her, leading to her being raised by devout Catholic grandparents. She has bipolar disorder, which might affect her decision-making. The author says they were in a high school relationship, and C wanted to get married and have a family. When he didn't propose, she panicked. They were using birth control but not condoms, and she later got pregnant. The author was against the pregnancy and told her to get an abortion, which she agreed to, but then a \"miracle\" happened with the cat being hit by the car, and she changed her mind. The author then broke up with her and hasn't been involved in the child's life, though he pays child support.\n\nNow, considering the arguments. The author feels wronged because he wasn't ready for a child and thought she was being selfish by going against their agreement. On the other hand, people around him think he's being selfish for not being involved in his child's life. The child is now 5 and mentions not having a dad who plays with him, which is making the author feel guilty but he's still firm in his decision.\n\nLegally, in many places, parents have responsibilities towards their children, regardless of the circumstances. Even if the pregnancy was unplanned, once the child is born, the parent has obligations. The author is paying child support, which is good, but emotional and physical involvement is also important for a child's well-being. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, having a child and then cutting all contact except for financial support might be seen as neglectful. Even if the author feels he wasn't ready, once the child exists, he has a responsibility. The girlfriend's actions might have been impulsive and manipulative, but the author's complete withdrawal could be seen as selfish now. The child's well-being is a key factor here. The author's guilt when he hears the child say he doesn't play with him shows some remorse, but he's not acting on it.\n\nThe girlfriend's mental health is also a factor. Her bipolar disorder might have affected her decision-making, but that doesn't absolve her of responsibility. However, the author's ultimatum (me or the baby) might have pressured her into an agreement she later changed her mind about. But when she changed her mind, he didn't have the right to cut off the child entirely.\n\nSo, while the girlfriend's actions were arguably selfish, the author's refusal to be a part of his child's life is also harmful. He's prioritizing his own feelings over his child's needs. Even if the pregnancy was a result of deception, he's still the biological father. In most moral and societal contexts, a parent's responsibility extends beyond just financial support. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong for not engaging with his child.\n"
