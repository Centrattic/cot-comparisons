C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he broke up with his pregnant girlfriend, who later gave birth to their child, and he hasn't been involved in the child's life. He's paying child support but refuses to have contact. His reasoning is that he didn't want to have a child, she was selfish for getting pregnant without his consent, and he feels wronged.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, in most places, parents have a responsibility to support their child financially, regardless of their relationship status. So, he's doing that by paying child support. However, when it comes to custody and visitation rights, it might depend on whether there was a custody arrangement. If there's no court order, maybe he can choose not to be involved, but if there's a legal right for the child to have contact, then he might be in the wrong. The question here is more about moral responsibility rather than legal.\n\nEthically, the situation is more complex. He argues that the girlfriend deceived him by hiding her pregnancy. But he was in a committed relationship with someone who had a history of mental health issues (bipolar disorder) and a strong desire to have children. He was sexually active with her without using condoms, and even after she was diagnosed with PCOS, they continued without protection. That seems like a risk he took. However, she did get pregnant and then tried to go through with an abortion but changed her mind after the cat incident. \n\nHe claims he wasn't ready for a child and that she was selfish. But he also admitted to not using protection, which contributed to the situation. From a moral standpoint, being a parent is a significant responsibility, and even if the child's mother made decisions without his consent, he is biologically the father. Choosing not to be involved in the child's life could be seen as neglectful, especially since the child is growing up and asking about his father. The fact that the child says, \"my daddy doesn't play with me,\" suggests emotional harm. \n\nOn the other hand, the author feels wronged because he wasn't given a choice. The girlfriend did deceive him by hiding the pregnancy and changing her mind. His mental state and readiness for parenthood are important factors. However, once the child is born, the responsibilities might not just disappear. There's also the element of his parents being involved, which complicates things further. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a gray area. Legally, he's fulfilling his financial obligation, but ethically, not being involved in the child's life could be seen as neglect. The key points are: he didn't use protection, contributed to the pregnancy, and now the child is affected by his absence. While his feelings of being wronged are valid, the child's well-being is a significant ethical consideration. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not being involved, even if he feels he wasn't ready. The answer likely leans towards A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because being a responsible parent involves more than just financial support.\n"
