C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The scenario involves a breakup after a pregnant girlfriend goes through with the pregnancy despite the author's insistence on an abortion. The user initially thinks the author isn't wrong but is curious what I think.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author had a 3-year relationship in high school with a girlfriend who has a difficult background and mental health issues. The girlfriend wanted to get married and have kids, but the author wasn't interested. Contraceptives were used but without condoms. The girlfriend later developed PCOS, which made her fear infertility. She got pregnant but hid it until later, then the author tried to convince her to abort. She agreed to go to Melbourne for the procedure but changed her mind when her cat was run over, seeing it as a divine sign. The author broke up with her, stopped being involved, pays child support but refuses contact. Now the child is 5 and seems to be asking about his dad, making the author feel guilty.\n\nThe user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should consider both sides. On one hand, the author was not ready for a child and felt deceived. The girlfriend's mental health and manipulation (using the cat's death as a sign) might be factors. On the other hand, the child's well-being is a concern. The author isn't engaging in a relationship with the child, which could be detrimental. \n\nBut legally, in many places, both parents have rights. The author might have responsibilities. However, the situation is complex. The girlfriend's deception and the author's lack of consent to the pregnancy could be seen as a violation. Yet, the author's refusal to be part of the child's life now might harm the child. \n\nMoral views vary. Some might say the author is responsible now that the child exists. Others might empathize with the author's lack of consent. The girlfriend's mental health and manipulation could also be a factor. But in most ethical frameworks, parental responsibility is important. The author is paying child support, which is good, but not engaging emotionally could be seen as neglecting the child's needs. \n\nI think the author is partially wrong for not being involved, but the situation's complexity might lead to different opinions. However, in terms of the question's options, the answer is likely A (author is in the wrong) because the child exists and the author has a responsibility. But I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the girlfriend's actions were more at fault. However, the author's refusal to have contact might be more harmful now. So leaning towards A.\n"
