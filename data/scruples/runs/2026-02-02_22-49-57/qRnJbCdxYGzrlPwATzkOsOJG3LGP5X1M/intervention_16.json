C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the author had a relationship with a girl named C, who had a difficult past. Her parents weren't around, she was raised by grandparents who are devout Catholics, and she has bipolar disorder. They were together in high school, and C wanted to get married and have a family. The author wasn't interested in marriage, and C became more aggressive about it when she realized he wasn't going to propose. They were sexually active without condoms, and when she got pregnant, they argued. The author convinced her to get an abortion, but then a cat was run over on the way to the airport, which her grandparents took as a sign from God to keep the child. The author broke up with her, hasn't been involved with the child, and now feels guilt when the child says he doesn't play with his daddy. The author is being judged by others for abandoning the child, but he feels wronged and doesn't want to reverse his decision.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the pregnancy was unintended, the abortion was planned but then prevented by an accident (the cat being run over), the author broke up with C, is paying child support but not involved with the child. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the author is paying child support, which is a legal obligation. But emotionally and ethically, it's more complicated. The author claims he wasn't ready for a child and that C was being selfish by getting pregnant without his consent. However, once a child is born, the responsibilities change. In many places, fathers are expected to be involved in their child's life, regardless of the circumstances of the pregnancy or birth. The author's refusal to engage with the child might be seen as neglectful, especially since the child is now expressing not knowing his father.\n\nOn the other hand, the author felt coerced into the situation. C was emotionally manipulative, with a history of mental health issues, and the author felt she was using the pregnancy to trap him into becoming a parent. The author's perspective is that he had no say, and he's standing by his decision because he doesn't want to validate what he sees as her disrespect towards him.\n\nBut here's the thing: once a child is born, the legal and social responsibilities of parenthood kick in. Even if the pregnancy was a result of manipulation or deceit, the child is a separate person whose well-being should be considered. The author's current stance might be seen as selfish because it's affecting the child's emotional development. The fact that the child says \"my daddy doesn't play with me\" indicates that the child is feeling the absence of the father, which is a significant emotional impact.\n\nHowever, the author's position is that he's in the right because he was forced into a situation he didn't want and he's standing by his decision. But in many societies, there's an expectation that once a child exists, the parent should take responsibility for their role in the child's life. The author is fulfilling the financial part but not the emotional or personal involvement, which is where the conflict lies.\n\nSo, considering both perspectives, the author might be legally correct in paying child support, but socially and ethically, his refusal to engage with the child could be seen as wrong. The decision to break up after the abortion was planned, and then not taking part in the child's life might be viewed as abandoning the child, which is generally frowned upon. Even if he feels he was wronged, the child is innocent in this scenario and deserves a relationship with both parents if possible.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A), because his decision to cut off contact with his child, despite the circumstances, is harming the child's well-being and goes against societal expectations of parental responsibility.\n"
