C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, the author and his girlfriend were in a high school relationship. She had a tough upbringing, mental health issues with bipolar disorder, and they had issues with wanting to get married and have kids. The author didn't want to get married, so she panicked. They were using contraception, but she developed PCOS, which made her less likely to conceive. Then she got pregnant, but didn't tell him. When he found out, he wanted an abortion, but she changed her mind after a \"miracle\" with her cat. He then broke up with her and hasn't been involved with the child.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's look at both sides. On one hand, the author didn't want children, and she went against his wishes by getting pregnant and not telling him. Her actions could be seen as self-centered, especially considering her mental health and the pressure she felt from her background. He made a choice based on his own unpreparedness for parenthood.\n\nOn the other hand, once the child is born, the author has a legal and moral responsibility. Withholding contact from the child might affect the child's well-being. Some might argue that despite initial feelings, he should try to be part of the child's life. But he's also paying child support, which shows he's fulfilling his financial obligations.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but there's guilt when the child says \"my daddy doesn't play with me.\" So, the author's stance is firm, but the consequences for the child are concerning. Legally, he might not be wrong, but morally, it's a gray area. The key points are consent in the pregnancy decision, the mother's mental health, and the impact on the child.\n\nConsidering all that, the author's decision to break up was based on his own choice, but his ongoing disengagement from the child might be where the issue lies. However, the initial breakup might not be his fault if the pregnancy was a secret and against his wishes. So, maybe answer B (he's not in the wrong), but the situation is nuanced.\n"
