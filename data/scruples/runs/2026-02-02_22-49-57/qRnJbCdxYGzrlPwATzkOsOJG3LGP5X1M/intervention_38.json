C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend. The situation is pretty complex. \n\nFirst, the author was in a relationship with C, who had a tough background and mental health issues. C was really focused on getting married and having a family, but the author wasn't interested in proposing. They were on birth control, but C developed Polycystic Ovary Syndrome, which made her less fertile. She got pregnant anyway and hid it. When confronted, she denied knowing until the author convinced her to get an abortion. But then the cat got hit by the car on the way to the airport, which they saw as a divine sign to keep the child. The author broke up with her after she changed her mind.\n\nNow, the author is paying child support but hasn't had contact with the child. People are judging him for not being involved. He feels guilt but still stands by his decision, thinking C was being selfish.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. I need to consider both sides. Legally, in many places, the father has responsibilities even without being present. Emotionally, the author felt forced into parenthood and didn't consent. C's actions involved deception, which complicates things. \n\nBut then, once the child is born, the father's responsibilities don't disappear, regardless of the initial circumstances. The author's decision to cut off contact might be seen as neglectful, even if he didn't want the child. The child's well-being is also a factor. The author's guilt is there, but his actions have consequences on the child's life.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was manipulated and didn't have a say when the pregnancy proceeded despite his wishes. C's mental health and religious beliefs might have influenced her decisions. The author is paying child support, so maybe he's fulfilling financial obligations but not emotional ones.\n\nI think the key points here are consent and responsibility. The author didn't want the child, but by not getting an abortion, he's now a father. Even if the pregnancy was a result of deception, once the child is born, the father has a responsibility. So, while C's actions were wrong, the author's decision to cut contact could be seen as neglecting his duty. However, the initial breakup might be justified given the circumstances. But the ongoing lack of contact with the child is problematic. \n\nI'm torn. Legally, he might have responsibilities, but morally, the situation is complex. The author feels wronged, but the child's needs are important. Maybe the answer is that he's not entirely in the wrong, but he's also not absolved from responsibility towards the child. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for breaking up, not necessarily for not being involved later. Breaking up might be his right, but the aftermath is where the issue lies. So, maybe the answer is A (he is in the wrong) because even though C acted deceptively, once the child is born, the father has responsibilities. But I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, B if the breakup itself is justified given the circumstances. Hmm.\n"
