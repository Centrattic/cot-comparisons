C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend. Let me read through the details again to make sure I understand the situation.\n\nSo the user, let's call him J, had a 3-year high school relationship with C. C had a tough background: her father left her, her mother committed suicide, and she was raised by devout Catholic grandparents. C has bipolar disorder, which caused mood swings. She wanted to get married and have a family, but J wasn't interested in marriage. When C was diagnosed with PCOS, which made pregnancy less likely, she panicked. Despite using birth control and not using condoms (J's fault), C got pregnant. J found out and tried to convince her to get an abortion. They were set to go to Melbourne for the procedure when her cat was hit by the car, and she saw it as a sign from God to keep the baby. J then broke up with her. Now, the child N is 5, J pays child support but doesn't have contact. He feels guilty but is firm in his decision, thinking C was selfish and he wasn't ready for a kid.\n\nThe user is asking if he's the asshole (AITA). The options are A (he's wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. On one hand, J argues that C deceived him by hiding her pregnancy and manipulating the situation to get him to be a father. He wasn't ready for a child and felt forced. On the other hand, once the child is born, J is not involved in his life, which society might see as neglectful. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, J is paying child support, so he's fulfilling that responsibility. But emotional and social responsibilities are different. The child is growing up without a father figure. J's reasoning is that he feels wronged because he wasn't given a choice, and he's sticking to his decision. However, in many cultures, there's an expectation that biological parents have a responsibility to their children regardless of the circumstances. \n\nC's actions were certainly manipulative, but once a child is born, the rights and needs of the child usually take precedence. J's refusal to have contact might be seen as selfish now, even if he had valid reasons before. He also admits he feels some guilt when he hears the child's comment about not playing with him. That internal conflict suggests he knows there's some moral weight to his current stance. \n\nAnother angle: J's responsibility to the child. Even if the child was not planned, once born, the parent has obligations. J might not have wanted the child, but he is the father. By not being involved, he's avoiding responsibility, which could be considered wrong. \n\nAlso, the legal system in most places would require him to be involved in some way, especially if there's a court case. But since he's paying support, maybe he's fulfilling that. However, emotional and relational aspects are separate from legal. \n\nOn C's side, she had mental health issues and a traumatic background. Her actions might have been influenced by her desire to have a family despite her disorder. But that doesn't excuse her deception. \n\nIn terms of ethics, while J might have been wronged initially, once the child is born, his obligations as a parent might supersede his feelings. The fact that he's paying support but not being present could be seen as neglect. \n\nSo, considering all this, the majority view might be that J is in the wrong now because he's not engaging with his child, even if the circumstances of the pregnancy were problematic. His decision to cut ties completely could be seen as harmful to the child's well-being. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely A (he is in the wrong).\n"
