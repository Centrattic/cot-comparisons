C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with his pregnant girlfriend is in the wrong. The scenario is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, let's break down the facts. The guy was in a 3-year high school relationship with C. She had a tough upbringing and became religious. He wasn't interested in marriage or kids, but they had a sexual relationship with condoms not used consistently. She then got diagnosed with a condition that might make it hard to conceive, which affected her deeply. She got pregnant but hid it, then the guy convinced her to get an abortion, but on the day of the procedure, a cat was hit by their car, which they took as a sign from God to keep the baby. He broke up with her, hasn't been involved with the child, pays support but refuses contact. Now, the child is 5 and says the dad doesn't play with him, causing guilt but he still feels C was wrong.\n\nSo, the user thinks the author is not in the wrong. I need to consider both perspectives. Legally, in most places, the man isn't required to be involved unless he's on the birth certificate, but he pays child support, so maybe he's legally recognized. Ethically, it's more complicated. Even if he didn't want the child, once the child exists, what's his responsibility? The mother might have a right to have the child, but the father's rights are a point of contention here. \n\nHe argues she was selfish for getting pregnant despite knowing his stance. She might have felt her own needs were valid, given her personal history. The abortion was his idea, but she decided against it after the \"miracle\" incident. He broke up with her, but now the child exists. His refusal to engage could be seen as abandonment, but he feels coerced into parenthood he didn't choose. \n\nMoral perspectives vary. Some might say once a child is born, the parent has responsibilities regardless of how it happened. Others might argue consent and autonomy\u2014since he didn't consent to the continuation of the pregnancy, he's not at fault for not wanting to be a parent. However, his lack of involvement is affecting the child's life, which is a concern. \n\nThe child's well-being is a key factor. The child doesn't know the context and just wants a daddy. The author's guilt is there, but he's firm. It's a tough call. Legally, he might not be in the wrong, but ethically, it's a gray area. The mother's actions were possibly manipulative, but the father's refusal to take part after the child's birth could be seen as neglectful. \n\nIn the end, society often places expectations on both parents to be involved, so even if he didn't want the child, the ongoing absence might make him wrong. But if he believes he was wronged initially, maybe there's validity to his stance. The answer depends on whether one prioritizes the child's needs over the father's autonomy. Given the situation, I think the author is in the wrong (A) because once a child exists, parental responsibilities are generally expected, and cutting all contact despite the child's well-being could be considered morally wrong. But this is a nuanced issue with no clear answer.\n"
