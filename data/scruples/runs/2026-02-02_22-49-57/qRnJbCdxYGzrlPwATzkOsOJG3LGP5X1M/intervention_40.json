C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend. The situation is pretty complex, so I need to break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, the timeline: they were in a high school relationship that ended after 3 years. The girl, C, has a troubled past with her parents, leading her to be raised by devoutly Catholic grandparents. She has bipolar disorder, which caused mood swings. The author mentions that C wanted to get married and have a family, but he wasn't interested. They had unprotected sex because she was on birth control. Then she got diagnosed with PCOS, which affects fertility. She tried to get pregnant anyway and succeeded. The author wanted an abortion but she refused at the last minute after a cat died, which she and her family took as a sign from God. The author then broke up with her but pays child support.\n\nNow, the key points to consider. The author claims he wasn't ready for a child and felt tricked because she hid the pregnancy and then refused the abortion. On the other hand, C had a mental health condition and a history of trauma. The author didn't use protection despite her being on birth control, which might be his fault if the pill failed. Also, she might have been in denial about the pregnancy, but she ended up carrying it to term after the cat incident.\n\nLegally, in many places, both parents have rights and responsibilities. By paying child support, the author is fulfilling some obligations, but emotionally and socially, there's a question about his responsibility as a father. The child now refers to him as someone who doesn't play, which might indicate a need for a father figure. The author's stance is that he wasn't ready and felt disrespected, but he's causing long-term consequences for the child.\n\nEthically, even if the initial decision to not have a child was valid, the child's well-being is a factor. The author's refusal to engage might harm the child's development. However, he might have legitimate reasons based on the circumstances. The question is whether his decision was selfish or protective. The cat incident seems like a cultural or religious trigger for her to carry the child, which the author might not have anticipated.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author shares some blame for not using protection and for not being more communicative about his feelings. But C's mental health and possible manipulation (hiding the pregnancy) also play a role. The fact that he broke up with her but still pays support shows a level of responsibility, but not emotional involvement.\n\nSo, considering all angles, maybe the author is partly in the wrong because, despite the circumstances, the child exists now, and he has a responsibility to be part of the child's life. The fact that he's causing the child emotional distress by not being present might outweigh his initial reasons for breaking up. However, the user's initial thought is that he's not in the wrong, but I need to weigh both sides.\n\nHmm. I think the answer is A (he is in the wrong) because even if the initial situation was complex, the child's needs now are paramount. His continued disengagement is harmful, regardless of past circumstances. But I'm not 100% sure. Some might argue that he had a right to his decision. But the child's well-being is a strong counterpoint.\n"
