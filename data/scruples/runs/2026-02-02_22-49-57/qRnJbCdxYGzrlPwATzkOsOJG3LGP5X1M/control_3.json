C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether they are at fault for breaking up with their pregnant girlfriend and not being involved in their son's life. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation from both sides. The author is a man who was in a relationship with a woman, C, who had a difficult past. C wanted to get married and have kids, but the author wasn't interested in marriage. They were having sex without using condoms, and she was on birth control. Then she developed PCOS, which made her worried about her ability to have kids. She lied about her pregnancy, kept it hidden, and then when the author was ready to leave and get an abortion, a cat died in front of the car, which she and her grandparents saw as a divine sign to continue the pregnancy. The author then broke up with her, didn't participate in the child's life, but pays child support. Now, the kid is 5 and doesn't know his father, and the author feels guilty but still stands by his decision.\n\nSo, the question is, is the author in the wrong? The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider legal, ethical, and moral aspects. Legally, the author is paying child support, which is correct. He's fulfilling that responsibility. But ethically, is he right to cut off contact entirely? Well, the author argues that C was selfish for tricking him into a child when he wasn't ready, and that she disrespected him. But he also didn't try to have a relationship with his son. He says she was being selfish, but by cutting off the child, isn't he being selfish too? \n\nC did deceive him by hiding the pregnancy and then changing her mind because of a \"miracle\" with the cat. But once the child is born, the author has responsibilities beyond just his personal feelings. Even if he didn't want the child, it's a human being who deserves a relationship with both parents. The author's decision to not be part of the child's life could be seen as neglecting his parental duties. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel betrayed and that his autonomy was violated. He wasn't ready for a child, and C's actions might have forced him into a situation he didn't want. However, once the child exists, the parent has responsibilities regardless of the circumstances. \n\nThere's a balance between personal autonomy and parental responsibility. The author might not be legally wrong (since he's paying support), but morally, he's neglecting his child. Many people would argue that a child has a right to know and have a relationship with both parents, unless there's abuse or neglect. The author hasn't provided evidence of such issues with C, beyond his own perception of her being selfish. \n\nAdditionally, the author's parents are involved, which complicates things further. The child is seeing them, which is good, but the biological father's absence could have emotional impacts on the child, as seen when the child says, \"my daddy doesn't play with me.\" That suggests the child is confused or hurt by the father's absence. \n\nSo, while the author's perspective is valid in terms of feeling wronged, his decision to completely cut off contact might be considered morally wrong. He has a duty to his child regardless of the circumstances of the child's birth. Therefore, the answer might be A, that he's in the wrong. But maybe there are nuances. Did he have a right to refuse? In some cases, if a parent is unfit, they can be denied, but the author hasn't been shown to be unfit. He's just choosing not to be involved. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely A. He's in the wrong because he's cutting off his child without valid reasons, despite having responsibilities as a parent.\n"
