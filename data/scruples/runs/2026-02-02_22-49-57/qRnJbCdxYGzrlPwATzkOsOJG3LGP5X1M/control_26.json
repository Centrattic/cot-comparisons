C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend. Let's break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the background: The author had a 3-year high school relationship with C. C has a traumatic past, including her parents leaving her, and she's religious and has bipolar disorder. She wanted to get married and have a family, but the author wasn't interested in marriage. They were sexually active, using birth control, but C got diagnosed with PCOS, which made her afraid she might not be able to conceive. Then she secretly became pregnant. The author wanted her to get an abortion, which she initially agreed to but then changed her mind after a \"miracle\" incident with the cat. The author left her, refuses to be involved with the child, pays child support but no contact. Now he's feeling guilt because the child says his daddy doesn't play with him, but he still thinks he's not in the wrong.\n\nSo, the main points to consider here are the ethics of his decisions. Legally, he's paying child support, which is required, but emotionally and morally, is he wrong for not being involved? \n\nFrom C's perspective, she might have felt desperate due to her mental health issues and her desire to have a family. She might have manipulated the situation, but her mental health complicates things. The author claims she deceived him, which is a key point. However, once the child is born, the author has a responsibility towards the child regardless of the circumstances. Cutting off contact entirely seems harsh, especially as the child grows older and starts asking about his father.\n\nThe author argues that he wasn't ready for a child and that C was selfish. But by not being involved in the child's life, he's possibly missing out on a relationship that could develop. Also, he's causing emotional harm to the child by not being present. While his initial decision to leave might be understandable given the circumstances, the ongoing refusal to engage might be seen as neglectful. \n\nSociety often places a lot of responsibility on both parents to be involved in a child's life. Even if the relationship ended, the child has a right to a relationship with both parents if it's in their best interest. The author's stance that he won't change his mind could be seen as rigid and not considering the child's needs now, separate from his past grievances with C.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel that C's actions were a betrayal, and he's justified in not wanting to be part of a relationship he didn't choose. But the child's well-being is a separate issue from the parents' relationship. Even with a strained history, the child deserves a relationship with both parents if possible. The author's refusal to engage, despite the child's longing for a father figure, might be the crux of the \"wrong\" here.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, most people would argue that a parent's duty to their child is separate from their relationship with the other parent. So even if the author feels wronged by C, his child's needs should be prioritized. Therefore, the author's actions are likely seen as morally wrong because he's denying his child a father's presence. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
