C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by going through the details.\n\nThe author had a 3-year relationship in high school with a girl named C. Her background is tough: her father left her, her mother committed suicide, and she was raised by devout Catholic grandparents. She has bipolar disorder, which caused erratic moods. She wanted marriage and kids, but the author wasn't interested. They used contraception but not condoms, and C developed PCOS, making pregnancy less likely. But she got pregnant anyway. The author convinced her to get an abortion, but on the day of the procedure, her cat got hit by the car. She and her grandparents thought it was a sign from God to keep the child. The author broke up with her, didn't take part in the child's life beyond paying support. Now N is 5, and he's saying his dad doesn't play with him. Author feels guilty but stands by his decision, thinking C was selfish.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, the author didn't want children and made that clear. He didn't propose, which was a point of contention for C. They had unprotected sex despite her on birth control, but he admits it was his mistake. She got pregnant and he wanted an abortion, which she initially agreed to. The cat incident led her to change her mind. The author broke up with her, then refused to have a relationship with the child.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the child is his, so he's responsible for support. But emotionally and ethically, it's complicated. He didn't want the child and felt coerced into a pregnancy that he had no control over. C's mental health issues might have influenced her decisions, but she did agree to the abortion initially. The author is now facing judgment for not being involved, but he's also been consistent in his stance.\n\nOn the other hand, once the child is born, he has a responsibility. Even if he didn't want to be a father, the child has a right to a relationship with him. The author's refusal to engage despite paying support could be seen as selfish. Also, N is a child and can't understand the situation; he just feels his dad isn't there. The author might be projecting his own feelings onto C's actions, seeing them as selfish, but his current actions could be seen as similarly selfish.\n\nBut the author's argument is that he was wronged by C's deception. She hid the pregnancy and then changed her mind due to the cat incident. He feels he had no say in the matter. However, once the child is born, his choices affect another person's life. The guilt from N's comment might indicate that his decision has ongoing negative consequences.\n\nIt's a tough call. The author made a choice based on his unwillingness to be a parent, but by not engaging, he's denying his child a relationship. There's a balance between personal rights and responsibilities. Some might say he's in the wrong because once a child is born, the parent has duties beyond just financial support. Others might see his stance as a right to refuse parenthood if the circumstances were not consensual. But in many places, you can't opt out of parenthood just because you didn't want to be a parent. The author's actions could be seen as neglecting his parental responsibilities beyond support. So maybe he is in the wrong.\n"
