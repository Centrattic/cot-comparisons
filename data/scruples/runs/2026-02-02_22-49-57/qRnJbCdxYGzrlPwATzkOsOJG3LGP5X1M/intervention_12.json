C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author broke up with his pregnant girlfriend, C. They had a 3-year relationship in high school. C had a tough upbringing, with her father abandoning her and her mother committing suicide. She was raised by devout Catholic grandparents and has bipolar disorder. She wanted marriage and kids, but the author wasn't interested. They had sex without condoms, and C was on birth control. Then she developed PCOS, which made her worry about fertility. Later, she got pregnant secretly. The author wanted an abortion, but she refused after a \"miracle\" with the cat. He broke up with her, and now the child is 5, and he's not involved. He feels guilt but still stands by his decision.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. First, consent and responsibility. The author had sex without using condoms, which is a big part of the problem. Even if he thought she was on birth control, relying solely on that can be risky. If there was a failure in contraception, he shares some responsibility. He did admit it was his bad for not using condoms. So maybe he's part of why the pregnancy happened.\n\nNext, when the pregnancy was discovered, he wanted an abortion but C didn't. The author's stance was that he didn't want a child and she was being selfish. But C's mental health is a factor here. Her bipolar disorder might have affected her decision-making, especially if she's in a manic episode. Also, her upbringing and religious beliefs could have influenced her to want the child despite the circumstances.\n\nThen there's the issue of the author breaking up with her. He was clear he didn't want a child, so when she decided to keep it, he ended the relationship. That seems like a personal choice, but he also stopped being involved in the child's life. Child support is mandatory in many places, but emotional involvement is another matter. Not having contact with his child might be seen as neglectful, even if he's paying financially. The child's well-being is a concern, especially now that he's asking about his \"daddy.\"\n\nThe author feels that C deceived him. But deception is tricky. She did hide the pregnancy, but she also wanted a family for a long time. He wasn't committed to the idea, so maybe there was mutual responsibility in not being honest about their expectations. However, she did take steps to hide the pregnancy until the last minute, which complicates things.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the author isn't the legal parent, so his rights might not be as strong. But ethically, he might feel obligated to be a father. The fact that his parents are involved helps, but the child still needs a father figure, even if it's just for emotional support.\n\nThe author's mental state is also a factor. He might be acting out of fear or not being ready. But a child needs stability, and cutting off contact completely could harm the child. The guilt he's feeling now suggests he's conflicted, but he's holding onto the idea that C disrespected him.\n\nIn terms of societal judgment, people might see the author as abandoning his child. However, there's also the perspective that he wasn't given a choice when the pregnancy was hidden. So there's a clash between his autonomy and the child's rights.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, he shares some responsibility in the pregnancy by not using protection. He didn't follow through on being a father, which affects the child. But he wasn't the one who wanted the child. The situation is complex with mental health, deception, and differing expectations. Legally, maybe not in the wrong, but ethically, he might be. The child's best interests are paramount, and the author's lack of involvement could be harmful. But considering the circumstances, maybe there's a middle ground. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Given that he chose not to be part of his child's life, which is a significant ethical failing, I think the answer leans towards A (he is in the wrong).\n"
