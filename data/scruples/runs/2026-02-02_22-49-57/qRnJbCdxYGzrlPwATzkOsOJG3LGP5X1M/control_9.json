C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the author was in a relationship with a woman who had a difficult past, including mental health issues. She had bipolar disorder, which might have affected her decisions. She wanted to have a family but the author wasn't ready. They were using contraceptives, so she unexpectedly got pregnant. The author convinced her to get an abortion, but then something happened with the cat being hit by the car, which she took as a sign from God to keep the baby. The author broke up with her after she changed her mind. Now he's not involved in the child's life, even though he pays child support. People are judging him for not being part of his child's life, but he feels wronged because he wasn't ready and she \"deceived\" him.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the author's right to consent to a pregnancy, the woman's mental health and possible manipulation, the sudden change in plans after the abortion was scheduled, and the current lack of contact with the child. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the author isn't the legal father since they weren't married, but he's paying child support, so maybe there's a legal obligation. Emotionally and ethically, it's a gray area. The woman did hide the pregnancy until late, which the author might see as deceptive. But she had her own reasons, possibly influenced by her mental health and religious beliefs.\n\nThe author's decision to break up and not be involved is causing the child emotional harm, as mentioned by the comment about the child saying \"my daddy doesn't play with me.\" That's a strong indicator of possible wrongdoing from the author's side. Children need parental figures, and cutting off contact completely might be harmful, even if the father isn't ready. However, the situation where the mother might have manipulated the situation to force the pregnancy could also be a factor.\n\nBut from an ethical perspective, even if the author wasn't ready, he did pay child support and has seen the child through his parents. However, the lack of contact and the author's stance that he never wanted a child might be seen as him not taking responsibility. The fact that he's paying child support shows some level of commitment, but not being involved in the child's life could be seen as selfish now. The question is whether his initial decision to break up was justified, but the ongoing lack of contact is where he might be in the wrong now.\n\nAlso, considering the mother's mental health, was she capable of making sound decisions? The author might have a point about not being consulted, but once the child was born, the responsibility isn't just on the mother. The author's refusal to engage despite the child's needs might be ethically problematic. So, while there are arguments on both sides, the current situation with the child's well-being being affected might tip the scales towards the author being in the wrong now, even if there were issues in the past.\n"
