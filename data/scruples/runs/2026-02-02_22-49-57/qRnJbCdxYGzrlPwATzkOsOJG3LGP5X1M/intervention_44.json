C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend. The story is pretty detailed.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the facts. The author was in a 3-year high school relationship with C. C had a tough childhood and became religious. She had bipolar disorder, which led to erratic behavior. She wanted to get married and have a family, but the author wasn't interested in marriage. They were sexually active without condoms, and she was on birth control. Then she got PCOS, making pregnancy less likely, which upset her because she wanted kids so badly. Despite that, she got pregnant and hid it. The author found out and pressured her to get an abortion. They were about to go to Melbourne for the procedure when the cat died, which C and her grandparents saw as a sign from God to keep the baby. The author then broke up with her, refused to take part in the child's life, and only pays child support. Now he's feeling conflicted after hearing his son says he doesn't play with him, but he's still firm in his decision.\n\nSo, the main points here: Did the author have a right to break up with her? Was he wrong for not being involved in the child's life? Let's consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the author didn't want children and didn't agree to the pregnancy. C deceived him by hiding the pregnancy and then proceeded with the child against his wishes. He felt forced into a situation he wasn't ready for. The religious aspect of the cat being a sign complicates things, but the author's stance is that he wasn't responsible for the child.\n\nOn the other hand, by law, he is the father and has responsibilities. Withholding contact might be seen as neglectful, especially as the child grows older and is aware of the absence. However, the author claims that C was selfish for forcing the pregnancy and that he's being judged harshly for his choice.\n\nI need to think about ethics and legal obligations. Legally, he might have obligations to support the child financially, which he's doing. But emotionally and morally, there's a debate. Did he have the right to refuse involvement given the circumstances? Some might argue that once a child is born, the parent has a duty regardless of the circumstances. Others might see the author's position as valid if he was coerced and not given a choice.\n\nAlso, the deception part: C hid the pregnancy and then proceeded against his wishes. That could be seen as manipulation. But does that absolve the author of his responsibility? It's a tricky balance.\n\nIn terms of the question, the user thinks the author is not in the wrong. The answer options are A for yes (he's wrong) and B for no. Considering all factors, the author's actions stem from not wanting a child and feeling forced into it, but the legal and moral responsibilities towards the child are significant. However, the initial breakup was due to the pregnancy being a result of deception and against his consent. So, depending on perspective, the answer might vary. But since the user is asking for a judgment on right or wrong, the legal angle might lean towards AITA being the author, but ethically, it's a gray area. However, given the setup, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong) as per the user's own thought, but I need to be careful here. Alternatively, maybe the answer is A because despite the circumstances, he's not involved with his son, which is a moral failing. But the initial situation complicates it. Hmm.\n"
