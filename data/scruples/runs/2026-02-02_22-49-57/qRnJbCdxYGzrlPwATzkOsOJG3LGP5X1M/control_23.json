C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nFirst, the guy was in a 3-year high school relationship with C. C has a tough background\u2014her dad left, her mom committed suicide, and her grandparents are devout Catholics. So C is religious and maybe that's influenced her views on family and marriage. She wanted to get married and have a family but the author wasn't interested in proposing. When she couldn't get him to commit, she started panicking and became aggressive, leading to arguments. They were still sexually active, he admits to not using condoms even when she was on birth control. Then, C got diagnosed with PCOS, which made her less likely to conceive, but she was obsessed with having a baby. \n\nAfter some time, she got pregnant. The author found out and pushed for an abortion, giving her an ultimatum: him or the baby. Eventually, he convinced her to get an abortion, but then the cat got run over on the way to the airport. The religious family took this as a sign from God to keep the child, so she didn't have the abortion. The author then broke up with her. He hasn't been involved in the child's life but pays child support. Now, he's being judged for abandoning the child, but he feels she was selfish for deceiving him and that he's not ready to be a father. The child is 5 and says the daddy doesn't play with him, which makes him feel guilty, but he still stands by his decision.\n\nSo the question is: is the author in the wrong? The options are A (Yes) or B (No). Let me break this down.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he claims he wasn't ready for a child, and C deceived him by hiding her pregnancy to push her own agenda. He felt forced into a situation he didn't want. He also mentions that C was being selfish, and he doesn't want to validate her disrespect by changing his mind. \n\nBut from the other side, C had a history of mental health issues (bipolar, PCOS diagnosis affecting her ability to conceive). The author didn't use protection, so he was at least partially responsible for the pregnancy. Even if he wasn't ready, by not using condoms, he contributed. Also, when he found out she was pregnant, he gave her an ultimatum, which could be seen as pressuring her in a different way. Then, after she decided to keep the child, he broke up with her and cut off contact. The child is now 5, and he hasn't been involved, even though he pays support. The child is aware of the father's absence, which is causing emotional distress.\n\nLegally, he's paying child support, so he's fulfilling a duty. But morally, is he in the wrong? Well, in many places, fathers are expected to take responsibility for their children, even if the mother made the decision to keep the baby. The author knew the risk of pregnancy because he didn't use condoms. By not using protection, he's at least partially responsible. Also, even if the mother was manipulative, he could argue that he's not ready, but by cutting off contact completely, he's not allowing a relationship with the child. The child support is important, but being a parent is more than just financial. The child is starting school and needs a father figure, and the author's absence is affecting him.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might believe that the mother tricked him into fathering a child without his consent. But in reality, once someone becomes a parent, they can't just opt out of the relationship. Even if the mother was using religion or mental health issues to justify keeping the child, the father still has a responsibility. The author's stance that he doesn't want to validate her disrespect by changing his mind is a bit confusing. It's not about validating her; it's about his responsibility to the child.\n\nThe mother's actions could be seen as selfish, especially if she was hiding the pregnancy and using the ultimatum to push through. But the author's decision to walk away without a relationship with the child seems selfish too, especially considering the child's well-being. The guilt he feels now, given the child's comment, shows he's aware of the emotional impact, but he's choosing to stay distant. \n\nI think the key points here are the use of protection (or lack thereof), the mother's mental health, the ultimatum the author gave, and his subsequent decision to not be involved. While the mother's deception and pressure are problematic, the author also shares responsibility for not using condoms. Once the child was born, he can't just abandon the child entirely. So the author is in the wrong because he's not taking on his parental role beyond financial support. Even if he's not ready to be a hands-on dad, the child deserves to have a relationship with him. The fact that the child is now starting school and expressing that his daddy doesn't play with him shows the importance of his presence. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
