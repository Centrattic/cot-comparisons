C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend. There are a lot of factors here.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that when they found out she was pregnant, he convinced her to get an abortion. Then, on the day they were going to the airport for the procedure, the cat got hit by the car, which they saw as a miracle. She decided to keep the child, and he broke up with her. Now, he's cutting contact with the child and feels judged by others.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, he's paying child support, which is right. But emotionally and morally, it's tricky. He wasn't in favor of the pregnancy, and he didn't want to be a father. But once the child was born, he's refusing to be involved. The child is now 5 and knows about his \"daddy\" who doesn't play with him. That's tough on the kid. \n\nThe girlfriend, C, had a hard past and maybe used the pregnancy as a way to fulfill her desire for a family. But she also deceived him by hiding the pregnancy. However, when the chance to abort was there, she changed her mind because of the cat incident. That seems like she made a choice, even if it was influenced by religion. \n\nThe author's stance is that he wasn't ready, but now that the child exists, he's not taking part. But as a parent, even if you don't want to be involved, you have responsibilities. The fact that the child is affected by his absence is a big issue. The author feels he was wronged, but his current actions may be hurting the child more. \n\nSociety often looks at parental involvement as important, and cutting off contact can be seen as selfish. Even if the pregnancy was unwanted at the time, the child's well-being is a consideration now. The author's refusal to connect might be harming N. \n\nSo, while there are complexities on both sides, the author's decision to cut off contact after the child's birth seems to be the main issue. He's in the wrong because he's avoiding responsibility beyond just paying support. The child deserves a relationship with both parents if possible, unless there's a valid reason to avoid it, which isn't clear here. The answer is likely A.\n"
