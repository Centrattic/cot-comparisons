C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about breaking up with a pregnant girlfriend and then refusing to have contact with the child. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the timeline and the circumstances. The author was in a high school relationship with C, who had a tough background and mental health issues (bipolar disorder). C wanted to get married and have a family, but the author wasn't interested in marriage. They were sexually active without condoms, and C was on birth control. Then she got diagnosed with PCOS, which made her fear infertility. Despite that, she ended up pregnant. The author wanted an abortion, but when they were about to go get one, the cat died, which C's family interpreted as a sign from God to keep the baby. The author then broke up with her and hasn't been involved in the child's life, only paying child support.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is at fault. Let's break it down.\n\nOn one hand, the author felt pressured by C to have a child when he wasn't ready. He tried to convince her to get an abortion and even made plans to go to Melbourne. But when she changed her mind because of the \"miracle\" with the cat, he walked away. He's been paying child support, but not engaging with the child. People around him think he's wrong for not being part of the child's life.\n\nOn the other hand, C had mental health issues and a traumatic past. She might have been manipulative or used her mental state to push for the pregnancy. However, the author also contributed by not using protection and not being honest about his feelings regarding marriage and children. Also, by paying child support, he's acknowledging some responsibility, but not being present could be seen as neglectful.\n\nThe key points here are consent to parenthood and responsibility. The author didn't want the child, and C proceeded without his consent. But once the child was born, the author's refusal to engage is where the moral dilemma lies. Legally, he has responsibilities as a parent, but morally, people might judge him for not being involved. However, his reasons for not being involved are rooted in the belief that C was disrespectful and manipulative.\n\nBut wait, does the fact that he didn't want the child from the start absolve him of being a father? Society often expects fathers to be involved regardless of their initial intentions. Also, the child's well-being is a factor. The author's absence might harm the child's life, especially as the child starts to understand family dynamics.\n\nBut the author argues that C was being selfish by deceiving him and using the pregnancy to force his hand. He also feels he's been wronged. However, by continuing to pay child support, he's recognizing his parental responsibility financially. The emotional neglect is a separate issue.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? There's a conflict between personal choice and societal/familial expectations. Legally, he's responsible, but morally, it's debated. If he didn't consent to the pregnancy and felt manipulated, some might side with him. But others would say that once a child is born, the parent has a duty to be involved regardless of the circumstances.\n\nAlso, the fact that the child is now 5 and starting school, and the child mentions not having a daddy in his life complicates things. The author's guilt is evident, but he's firm in his decision. Is it possible that he's in the wrong for not taking responsibility beyond financial support? Or is C also at fault for not respecting his wishes?\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's refusal to engage with the child is seen as a moral failing. Even if he didn't want the child, once the child exists, he has a responsibility to be part of their life. So the author's stance could be considered wrong for not fulfilling that responsibility. However, the situation is nuanced because of the coercion and mental health factors involved with C. But ultimately, the father's responsibility is a key point here. So the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong.\n"
