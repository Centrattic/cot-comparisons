C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the guy broke up with his pregnant girlfriend after she decided to keep the baby instead of getting an abortion. The user wants to know if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, let's look at the key points. The guy was in a high school relationship with a girl who had a rough upbringing and mental health issues. She wanted to get married and have kids, but he didn't. They didn't use protection, and she got pregnant. He wanted her to have an abortion, but she changed her mind after a \"miracle\" with her cat. He broke up with her and hasn't been involved with the child, though he pays child support. Now he feels guilty but doesn't want to change his decision.\n\nThe question is whether he's at fault. On one hand, he didn't want kids, and she manipulated the situation to get what she wanted. She hid her pregnancy, which is deceitful. He argues that she disrespected him by not getting the abortion. On the other hand, he's a father now and not being involved could be seen as selfish. He's causing the child emotional distress by not being present, even if he's paying support.\n\nBut from a legal standpoint, parents have rights and responsibilities. Even if you don't want kids, once a child is born, you're responsible. Emotionally, the child is missing a father, which is a valid concern. The guy might feel wronged, but cutting off contact entirely might be seen as neglectful. Also, he chose not to validate her disrespect by changing his mind, but maybe that's not the right approach.\n\nConsidering societal views, most people would argue that being a parent is a lifelong commitment. Even if the child's mother was at fault, the father has a duty to be involved. The child's well-being is important. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not being there for his son. However, the mother's actions were also problematic. But since the child is affected, the father's responsibility is key here.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the father's decision to stay away could be seen as morally wrong, regardless of his past. The child needs both parents, ideally. The guy feels guilt but is sticking to his decision, which might not be the right path for the child's sake. So overall, even if the mother was wrong, the father is also in the wrong for not being part of his son's life.\n"
