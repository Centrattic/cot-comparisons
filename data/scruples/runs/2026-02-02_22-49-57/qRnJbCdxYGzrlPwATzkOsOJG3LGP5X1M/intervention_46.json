C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a breakup after the girlfriend became pregnant, and the author decided not to be part of the child's life.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author was in a 3-year high school relationship with a girl named C. C had a tough upbringing and mental health issues (bipolar disorder). She wanted to get married and have a family, but the author wasn't interested. They had a sexual relationship without condoms, and C stopped taking her birth control. She later got pregnant with polycystic ovary syndrome, which made her fear infertility. The author tried to convince her to have an abortion, which she initially agreed to, but then a cat was hit by the car, and she saw it as a sign from God to keep the baby. The author broke up with her and hasn't been involved in the child's life, paying child support but no contact. Now, the child is 5, and the author is struggling with guilt but still believes C was selfish.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A or B). \n\nI need to consider both perspectives. Legally, the author isn't the legal parent, so maybe he isn't obligated to be involved. However, in many places, biological fathers can become legal parents if they acknowledge paternity. The author did so by paying child support, which typically establishes legal responsibility. So even if he didn't want the child, he's a legal parent now. \n\nEthically, the author had a role in the pregnancy by not using protection. He claims he wanted an abortion, but C went through with the pregnancy. The author's decision to break up and not be involved could be seen as abandoning the child. The child's well-being is a factor. The child is now 5 and may be confused about his absence. The author's parents are involved, but the author's lack of contact might affect the child's development. \n\nC's actions: she did hide the pregnancy and tried to get an abortion but then changed her mind. Her mental health and upbringing might be factors in her decisions. However, tricking the author into a situation where he's now a parent without his consent could be seen as selfish. But the author also contributed to the situation by not using protection despite knowing her desire to have a family.\n\nThe moral dilemma here is about responsibility versus autonomy. The author argues he wasn't ready and was wronged by C's deception. However, once he acknowledged paternity, he has a responsibility. The fact that he's paying child support shows he accepts financial responsibility, but emotional and parental involvement is another aspect.\n\nIn many ethical frameworks, once you become a parent, the child's best interest is paramount. The author's refusal to engage could be seen as harmful. However, if the author truly believes he's not ready or capable, maybe there's a case for not being the primary parent. But completely cutting off contact when the child is asking about his \"daddy\" might be unwise.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions have negative consequences for the child. Legally and ethically, he might be in the wrong for not being involved. Even if he believes he was wronged initially, the child's needs now are important. The answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because of the ongoing impact on the child and the responsibilities he has taken on by acknowledging paternity.\n"
