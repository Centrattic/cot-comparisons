C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author broke up with his pregnant girlfriend, C, five years ago. They were in a high school relationship that lasted three years. C had a tough upbringing, including parental abandonment and a mental health condition (bipolar disorder). She was very religious and wanted to start a family, but when the author didn't propose, she became aggressive about it. They had unprotected sex, and despite C's polycystic ovary syndrome, she got pregnant. The author tried to convince her to get an abortion, which she agreed to, but then changed her mind after a \"miracle\" event with her cat dying. The author then broke up with her, hasn't been in contact with the child, N, and is paying child support. Now, the child is saying he doesn't play with his dad, which is making the author feel guilty, but he still believes he was wronged.\n\nFirst, I should consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, the father is responsible for child support regardless of being involved in the pregnancy. So the author isn't breaking the law by not being present but is fulfilling his financial duty. However, ethically, it's more complex. The author argues that C deceived him by hiding the pregnancy and then changing her mind about the abortion. But C might have felt pressured by her religious beliefs and family after the accident with the cat. The author's decision to leave was based on his belief that he wasn't ready for a child and felt disrespected by C's actions.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's refusal to be part of his child's life could be seen as neglectful. The child is growing up without a father figure, which can have emotional and psychological effects. The author's guilt is evident, but he's stuck in his decision. There's a balance between personal autonomy and parental responsibility here. The author wasn't ready, but once the child is born, there's a societal expectation to be involved.\n\nC's actions could be seen as manipulative, but her mental health and upbringing might have influenced her behavior. The author might feel he was a victim of her decisions, but he also has a responsibility towards the child now. It's a tough call because both parties have valid points. However, the author's continued disengagement, despite the child's growing awareness of his absence, might be considered ethically wrong. The author's stance that he won't change his mind could harm the child's well-being. So, while the author's initial decision to break up might be understandable under the circumstances, his ongoing refusal to be part of his child's life could be seen as being in the wrong.\n"
