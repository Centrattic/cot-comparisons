C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is pretty complex. So, the author had a long-term relationship with a girl named C, who had a tough past. C was dealing with mental health issues\u2014bipolar disorder\u2014and they weren't using proper contraception. She found out she had a condition that made pregnancy harder, which upset her. Then she got pregnant, but hid it. The author wanted an abortion, and C agreed to get one, even going as far as packing her bags and going to the airport. But on the way, the cat died, which C and her family interpreted as a sign from God to keep the baby. The author then broke up with her and hasn't been involved in the child's life, even though he's paying child support. Now, he's feeling conflicted because the child mentions not having a dad, but he's still firm in his decision.\n\nFirst, the author's main argument is that he wasn't ready for a child, and C deceived him by hiding the pregnancy and then changing her mind due to the \"miracle\" with the cat. He feels disrespected and didn't want to be a father. On the other hand, people around him think he's being selfish now for not engaging with his child.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, he's paying child support, which he's obligated to do. But emotionally and morally, it's tricky. C did make a choice to continue the pregnancy after agreeing to the abortion, which might have been a betrayal of trust. However, once the child is born, the author has parental responsibilities. By cutting off contact, he's avoiding those responsibilities, which could be seen as neglectful. Even if the child's mother is the primary caregiver, the father's presence can be important for the child's well-being.\n\nThe author might argue that he was coerced into the situation since C deceived him and the pregnancy was a result of her actions. But once the child exists, he's still a parent. The fact that the child is now expressing confusion about not having a dad suggests that the author's absence is affecting the child negatively. The author's stance that he won't change his mind because he doesn't want to validate C's disrespect might be his way of holding onto his principles, but it's also harming the child.\n\nSo, while there are elements where C acted irresponsibly and perhaps manipulatively, the author's decision to completely disengage from his child's life seems to be where he's in the wrong. The child has a right to know and have a relationship with their father if possible, regardless of the circumstances. The author's guilt and the child's feelings indicate that his decision, while based on past grievances, is causing ongoing harm. Therefore, even if he feels wronged, his current actions are morally questionable.\n"
