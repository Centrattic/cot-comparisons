C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend. Let me go through the details again.\n\nFirst, the author and his girlfriend, C, were in a high school relationship. C has a tough past, including her parents' issues and being raised by devout Catholic grandparents. She has bipolar disorder, which caused mood swings. She really wanted to get married and have kids, but the author wasn't interested. They were sexually active, using birth control but not condoms. C later got diagnosed with PCOS, making pregnancy harder, which distressed her. She then got pregnant secretly, and the author convinced her to get an abortion. But when the cat died before the procedure, they took it as a sign from God to keep the baby. The author broke up with her, refused to be involved, pays child support but avoids contact. Now the child, N, mentions not having a daddy, and the author feels guilty but still stands by his decision.\n\nHmm, so the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks he isn't, but wants my opinion.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the author isn't the legal father since he didn't acknowledge paternity or marry C. But legally, if he's paying child support, he might have some obligations. However, the ethics here are more complicated. \n\nC lied about her pregnancy. That's a big factor. The author thought he convinced her to have an abortion, but she went against his wishes when the cat died. Deception here is a key point. He argues she was selfish, manipulating the situation to get the child. On the other hand, he didn't use protection and didn't check if the birth control was effective. His responsibility in the situation is a point against him.\n\nBreaking up after the pregnancy is his choice, but refusing to be involved as a father is another issue. The child is now 5 and asking about the daddy. The author is avoiding contact, which could harm the child. But he claims he wasn't ready and that C disrespected him by deceiving him.\n\nThere's a balance between his right to make decisions about fatherhood and the child's right to a relationship with a parent. The author's parents are involved, which might help, but the child's emotional well-being is affected by the lack of a father figure.\n\nMorally, some might say he's in the wrong for not engaging now, even if he was wronged. Others might empathize with his situation, given the deception and pressure from C. It's a tough call. Legally, he's not the father, but ethically, there's a gray area. The author's refusal to change his stance despite the child's feelings might make him seem more in the wrong now.\n"
