C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author had a relationship with a girl named C, who had a tough upbringing. C was religious and wanted to have a family, but the author wasn't interested in marriage. They had a long-term relationship, used birth control but no condoms. Then C was diagnosed with PCOS, which made her worried about her ability to conceive. She ended up getting pregnant, hid it, and then the author convinced her to get an abortion. But on the way to the abortion, the cat was hit by the car, which C and her family saw as a sign from God to keep the baby. The author broke up with her, hasn't been involved in the child's life, and now feels guilt when the child says his daddy doesn't play with him. The author feels wronged and refuses to change his stance.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's look at both sides.\n\nFrom the author's perspective: He wasn't ready for a child, and C deceived him by hiding her pregnancy. He tried to get her to get an abortion, which she agreed to, but then changed her mind due to what they considered a divine sign. The author feels it was selfish of C to proceed without his consent. He's paying child support but hasn't had contact. He's torn between guilt and his belief that he was wronged.\n\nOn the other side: The author did not use protection, contributing to the risk of pregnancy. Even with PCOS, pregnancy is possible. The author's refusal to take part in the child's life could be seen as neglectful, especially since the child is now expressing that his daddy isn't there. The author's decision to break up after the abortion might be seen as abandoning the child, which many would consider irresponsible. Also, the idea that C's actions were selfish versus the author's current actions being selfish is a point to consider.\n\nLegally, the author is obligated to provide child support, which he's doing, but emotionally and morally, not engaging with the child could be problematic. The fact that the child is affected by his absence might weigh on the judgment.\n\nC's responsibility: She had a medical condition that affected her fertility, but she still got pregnant. She also had a history of mental health issues (bipolar disorder), which might have influenced her decision-making. However, she was an adult and made choices, including continuing the pregnancy despite the author's objections.\n\nThe author's deception: He wasn't aware of her pregnancy, but he wasn't using protection, which is part of the responsibility in a sexual relationship. Even if he wasn't expecting a pregnancy, it's possible he should have been more cautious.\n\nThe key issue is parental responsibility. Once a child is born, the legal and moral obligations for both parents typically include at least some level of involvement. The author's refusal to engage could be seen as neglecting those responsibilities. However, C's actions in continuing the pregnancy against his wishes might be seen as overriding his initial objections.\n\nBut from a societal perspective, many would argue that once a child is born, the parent has a duty to be part of their life, regardless of the circumstances. The author's stance might be seen as selfish now, especially since the child is beginning to understand and express the absence of a father figure.\n\nIn terms of ethical theories, deontological ethics might say the author has a duty to be a father, while consequentialist might look at the harm caused by his absence versus his initial refusal to have a child. The situation is complex, and both sides have valid points.\n\nConsidering all this, I think the author is in the wrong. While he was not ready for a child and felt deceived, once the child was born, his responsibilities as a parent extend beyond his initial objections. His refusal to engage is harming the child's well-being, and he has a duty to be involved. So, answer A.\n"
