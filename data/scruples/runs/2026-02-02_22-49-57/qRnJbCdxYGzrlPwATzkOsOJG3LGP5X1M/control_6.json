C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend. The situation is pretty complex.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the key points. The author and his girlfriend, C, were in a high school relationship for three years. C had a tough upbringing, with her father abandoning her and her mother committing suicide. She was raised by devout Catholic grandparents and has bipolar disorder, which caused erratic moods. They were in a relationship where they were sexually active without condoms, and C was on birth control. Then she got diagnosed with PCOS, which made her fear infertility. Later, she became pregnant but hid it, and when confronted, she denied it. The author wanted an abortion, but she changed her mind after a cat died in front of their car, which her family saw as a sign from God. He broke up with her, refuses to take part in the child's life, but pays child support. Now, the child is 5 and the author feels guilt but isn't ready to change his stance.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. The user wants a simple answer A or B. Let me break it down. \n\nOn one side, the author didn't want to have a child and didn't feel pressured to continue the pregnancy. He tried to get the abortion, but she changed her mind at the last minute. He might feel that she manipulated the situation by hiding the pregnancy and then using the car incident as a reason to continue. He's also not involved with the child, which many might see as neglectful, especially since he's the biological father. The fact that the child is now talking about not having a dad could be seen as a consequence of his refusal to be involved.\n\nOn the other side, the author was in a relationship where the other person felt strongly about having a family despite his reservations. The pregnancy was a result of their sexual activity without proper protection. The woman's mental health and background might have influenced her decisions. The author's decision to break up might be seen as a way to avoid responsibility, but he hasn't abandoned the child entirely by paying child support. However, the lack of involvement beyond financial support is a point against him.\n\nLegally, the author is responsible for child support, so he's meeting that obligation. But emotionally and ethically, many would argue that a father has a responsibility to be involved in his child's life. The author's refusal to change his stance despite the child's feelings might be seen as selfish. However, the initial situation where the mother decided to continue the pregnancy against his wishes could be seen as her decision, which he respected by breaking up. \n\nBut the key here is that when you become a parent, you have certain responsibilities regardless of how the child came to be. The author's stance that he wasn't ready and doesn't want to be involved could be seen as neglecting those responsibilities. Even if he didn't want the child initially, now that the child is born, his absence is affecting the child's life. The fact that the child is expressing not having a dad shows the impact of his decision. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions, while understandable from his perspective, might be seen as ethically wrong because he's not fulfilling his parental role beyond financial obligations. Therefore, the answer would be A, he is in the wrong.\n"
