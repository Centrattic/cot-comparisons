C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend and not having contact with their child. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author had a relationship with C, who has a tough background and mental health issues. They weren't using condoms, and she was on birth control, but she got pregnant despite PCOS. The author wanted an abortion, and she agreed, but then a \"miracle\" happened (the cat died), and she changed her mind. He broke up with her and hasn't been involved with the child.\n\nSo, the main points are: the pregnancy was unexpected, there was a last-minute change of heart, leading to the breakup. The author feels he wasn't ready for a child and didn't want one. Now, the child is 5, and the author is paying child support but not being a father. People around him think he's wrong for not being involved.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. In many places, both parents have legal and moral responsibilities towards their child regardless of the circumstances. Even if the author didn't want the child, he has a duty to support and be part of the child's life. The fact that the mother might have manipulated the situation doesn't absolve him of his responsibilities. \n\nThe author's decision to not be involved is affecting the child. The child is starting to express confusion about not having a father figure. The author's stance is that the mother disrespected him, but he's choosing to reciprocate by not engaging with his son. This seems like a self-sabotaging cycle. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, while the mother's actions were deceitful, the child is innocent. The author is neglecting his parental duties, which is a significant issue. Even if he's upset with the mother, cutting off the child is not acceptable. He's in a position where he needs to take responsibility, regardless of the past. \n\nSo, the answer is likely A. The author is in the wrong because he's not fulfilling his parental responsibilities and is allowing past grievances to harm his child. The key here is that the child's well-being is more important than the conflict between the parents.\n"
