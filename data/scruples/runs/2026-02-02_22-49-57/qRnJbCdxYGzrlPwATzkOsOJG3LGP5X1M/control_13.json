C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by going through the situation carefully. \n\nThe author was in a high school relationship with C for three years. C has a tough background\u2014her father abandoned her and her mother committed suicide. She was raised by devout Catholic grandparents and has bipolar disorder. The author mentions that C had wanted to get married and have a family but when he didn't propose, she became aggressive. They were sexually active without condoms, and C was on birth control. Then she was diagnosed with PCOS, which made her worried about fertility. After some time, she got pregnant and hid it. The author found out and pressured her to get an abortion. They were about to leave for the procedure when the car hit the cat, which they saw as a miracle from God, so she decided to keep the baby. The author broke up with her, refuses to have contact with the child, pays child support, and now feels guilty when the child says his dad doesn't play with him. The author is defensive, saying C was selfish and he wasn't ready for a child.\n\nFirst, I should consider the legal and ethical aspects. In most places, parents have the right to make decisions about their own pregnancy, even if the partner disagrees. The author tried to influence her decision, but ultimately, the choice to continue the pregnancy was hers. The author's ultimatum might be seen as pressuring her, but once she decided to keep the baby, his responsibility as a parent comes into play. \n\nThe author's refusal to have contact with the child raises questions. Legally, he might have to pay child support, but emotionally and ethically, cutting off contact can harm the child. The child's well-being is a factor here. The author's reasoning is that C was selfish, but once the child is born, the parent-child relationship is a separate issue. \n\nC's actions might have been manipulative by hiding the pregnancy, but that doesn't negate the author's responsibility now. The author's guilt when the child mentions not having a dad suggests conflict in his feelings. The situation is complex, involving mental health, religious beliefs, and personal choices. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, while the author feels wronged, being a parent involves responsibilities beyond personal readiness. Even if he didn't want the child, the child has a right to a relationship with both parents if possible. The author's stance might be seen as selfish now, avoiding the responsibilities of parenthood. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for cutting off the child despite the circumstances. But there's also the initial pressure on C to abort, which complicates things. However, the current refusal to engage with the child seems more harmful. Therefore, the answer might be A (yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
