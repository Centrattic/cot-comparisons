C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend, C. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the context. The author was in a high school relationship with C, who had a tough upbringing and bipolar disorder. She wanted to get married and have kids, but he wasn't interested in marriage. They were having sex, and he didn't use condoms. C was on birth control, but then got diagnosed with PCOS, which lowered her chances of getting pregnant. Despite this, she became pregnant. \n\nThe author confronted her about an abortion, and she agreed. They were all set to go to Melbourne for the procedure, but on the day of the flight, her cat was run over. They took this as a sign from God to keep the baby. He then broke up with her and hasn't been involved, only paying child support.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. From a legal standpoint, he's paying child support, which he's obligated to do. But emotionally and socially, people are judging him for not being involved with his child. The user thinks he's not in the wrong, but others might argue that once a child is born, the parent has a responsibility regardless of the circumstances.\n\nOn the other hand, the author felt forced into a situation he didn't want. He tried to prevent the pregnancy through abortion but was overruled by C's religious beliefs. He's standing by his decision, and maybe he feels it's too late to change now. But the child is already born, and the author is missing out on a relationship with his son. \n\nEthically, this is a tough call. The author's right to autonomy is important, but the child's right to a relationship with both parents also matters. However, C's actions led to the pregnancy, and she's the one who changed her mind after an event she took as a divine sign. The author might feel betrayed and not ready for parenthood, which is a valid personal choice. \n\nBut once the child is born, the responsibilities change. Even if he didn't want to be a father, the child exists, and there's a duty to be part of the child's life. The author's decision to cut off contact could be seen as selfish now, even if he felt wronged initially. \n\nSo, considering all angles, while the author has a perspective that he was wronged and wasn't ready, once the child is born, the responsibilities shift. The author is in the wrong because he's refusing to engage with his son despite the child's needs and the societal expectation of parental involvement. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
