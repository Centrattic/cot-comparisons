C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about breaking up with a pregnant girlfriend. Let me go through the details again.\n\nThe author had a 3-year relationship in high school with C. C had a tough background, with her father abandoning her and her mother committing suicide. She was raised by grandparents who were devout Catholics. C became religious and has bipolar disorder, which caused mood swings. They were in a relationship, and C wanted to get married and have a family. The author didn't want to get married, so C started to panic. They were sexually active without using condoms, and C was on birth control. Then she got PCOS, which made her think she might not be able to have kids, so she became even more determined. She got pregnant, hid it, and when confronted, denied it. The author wanted an abortion and gave her an ultimatum: him or the baby. She agreed, and they were about to go to Melbourne for the procedure. But then her cat got run over on the way to the airport, and they saw it as a sign from God to keep the child. The author then broke up with her, stopped being involved, and only pays child support. Now the kid is 5, and the author feels guilty when he hears the child says \"my daddy doesn't play with me,\" but he still stands by his decision, thinking C was selfish, and he wasn't ready for a child.\n\nThe author is asking if he's in the wrong. He feels wronged because he wasn't ready, she deceived him, and he never wanted a child. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. First, the author and C were in a relationship. They had unprotected sex, and she was on birth control. He didn't use condoms. So both parties have responsibility for contraception. But she got pregnant despite the birth control. Then there's the issue of the abortion. He wanted it, she agreed, but then changed her mind because of the cat incident. He broke up with her, and hasn't been involved beyond child support. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, the author is obligated to pay child support, which he does. But emotionally and ethically, is he in the wrong? Well, once the child is born, the author has some responsibility. Even if he didn't want the child, cutting off contact entirely might be seen as neglectful. The child is now 5 and seems to be affected by the lack of a father figure. The author feels guilty but is still firm in his decision. \n\nC's actions: she got pregnant secretly, hid it, and perhaps manipulated him by pretending to go along with the abortion. The cat incident seems like a convenient excuse to change her mind. But does that make her actions justified? Probably not. However, the author's response was to cut off contact entirely. \n\nEthically, it's a tough one. The author had a right to make his own decisions about child-rearing, but once the child exists, he's part of the child's life. The author might not be in the wrong for not wanting to be a father, but he might be in the wrong for not trying to be involved. However, the child's well-being is a factor. The author's parents do take care of the child, so maybe that's some mitigation. \n\nBut from a broader perspective, the author's decision to not engage with the child at all, despite being the father, is questionable. Even if he feels wronged, the child has a right to a relationship with both parents, assuming it's in their best interest. The author's stance might be considered selfish now, even if he wasn't ready. \n\nOn the other hand, C's deception and manipulation could be seen as the root of the problem. She may have used her mental health issues (bipolar disorder) as a factor in her behavior, but that doesn't absolve her of responsibility. \n\nSo, balancing both sides: the author's actions in breaking up after the abortion plan being foiled by the cat incident might be seen as a valid response to being manipulated. However, cutting off all contact with the child and refusing to engage despite his needs might be where he's in the wrong. \n\nBut legally, he's meeting his obligations with child support. However, ethical and emotional aspects are different. The child's well-being is important, and the author's refusal to be involved beyond financial support is harmful. \n\nSo, in terms of being in the wrong, it's a complex situation. The author might not be entirely in the wrong for his initial decision, but his current stance on not engaging with the child could be where he's at fault. However, the question is whether he is in the wrong overall. \n\nConsidering all that, I think the answer is that he is in the wrong because once the child exists, the father has a responsibility beyond financial support. Even if he didn't want the child, he's now part of the child's life, and not being involved harms the child. So, answer A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
