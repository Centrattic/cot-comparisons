C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a breakup after the girlfriend, who was pregnant, decided to keep the child despite the author's objections. The author feels that he was pressured into the pregnancy and that the girlfriend was selfish. He hasn't engaged with the child and pays child support.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author argues that he wasn't ready for a child, that the pregnancy was a result of deception, and he felt forced into a situation he didn't want. On the other hand, the girlfriend had health issues that impacted her ability to conceive, leading her to get pregnant secretly. The author's refusal to be part of the child's life might be seen as neglectful, even if he's providing financially.\n\nLegally, he's obligated to pay child support, which he's doing, but emotionally and ethically, there's a question about the child's right to a relationship with both parents. The author's stance is firm, but the child's well-being is a factor here. The fact that the child is starting school and mentions the absence of a father adds emotional weight to the situation.\n\nAlso, the author's parents are involved with the child, which might mitigate some criticism. However, the author's refusal to engage could be seen as abdicating responsibility. The girlfriend's actions were arguably selfish, but the author's response in cutting off completely might also be considered selfish from the child's perspective.\n\nIn terms of societal views, many would argue that a child has a right to know and have a relationship with both parents, unless there are safety concerns. The author hasn't indicated any such issues, so his decision might be viewed as inconsiderate. However, the coercion and manipulation from the girlfriend's side could justify his frustration.\n\nBalancing these factors, the author might be seen as wrong for cutting off the child's relationship without ensuring the child's needs are met. Even if the initial situation was problematic, the child's current well-being is a separate issue. The author's guilt and the child's feelings suggest that his stance has consequences beyond his original dilemma.\n\nSo, while the girlfriend's actions were questionable, the author's refusal to engage with the child could make him partly at fault. Therefore, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong), but there's nuance. However, considering the child's right to a father, the answer leans towards A.\n"
