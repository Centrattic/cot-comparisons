C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend, C. The situation is complicated, so I need to consider both sides carefully.\n\nFirst, the author mentions they were in a high school relationship, and C had a tough upbringing with a mentally ill mother and abusive religious environment. C wanted to get married and have kids, but the author wasn't ready. They didn't use contraception, leading to pregnancy. The author wanted an abortion, but C didn't follow through when they found out about the cat incident, leading to the breakup.\n\nThe key points here are consent to parenthood and the dynamics of the relationship. The author didn't want to be a parent and was actively trying to prevent the pregnancy with birth control, which failed. C's decision to keep the child after the author's insistence on abortion could be seen as a breach of mutual agreement. However, once the child is born, the author has responsibilities as a legal parent, especially since they're paying child support.\n\nBut breaking up because of an unwanted pregnancy is a big decision. The author feels deceived because C hid the pregnancy and then changed her mind. However, C had her own reasons, possibly influenced by her traumatic background and religious beliefs. The cat incident seems like a catalyst for her decision, but the author might feel it's a manipulation to keep the child.\n\nLegally, the author is the father, and cutting off contact might be harmful to the child. Emotionally, the guilt is there, especially with the child saying \"my daddy doesn't play with me.\" But the author's stance is that he wasn't ready and felt disrespected. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, while the author didn't want to be a parent, once the child exists, he has a duty to some extent. However, the decision to break up wasn't about the child's well-being but his own unwillingness. The author's actions could be seen as selfish in the long run for the child's sake, despite his initial justification.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author made a personal choice based on his unwillingness, but the consequences affect the child. The answer might be a mix, but the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's fulfilling child support but avoiding contact, it's a complex issue. However, the initial breakup was based on his decision, so maybe he's not entirely wrong, but his current actions affect the child negatively. The answer might lean towards \"A\" because he's not taking full responsibility as a parent now.\n"
