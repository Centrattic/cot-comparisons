C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong regarding breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend and not having contact with his son. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation from both sides. The author was in a long-term relationship with C, who had a traumatic background and bipolar disorder. C wanted to get married and have a family, but the author wasn't interested in marriage. Despite this, they were sexually active without protection because he didn't use condoms and she was on birth control. Then, she developed PCOS, which made pregnancy harder, but she ended up getting pregnant anyway. \n\nThe author tried to convince her to have an abortion, which she initially agreed to. But when the cat was run over on the way to the airport, she changed her mind, seeing it as a divine sign. The author broke up with her, and hasn't had contact with the child since. He pays child support but refuses to be involved, leading to guilt when the child mentions not having a daddy.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. The author had a right to his own decisions about parenthood. However, by not using protection despite knowing she was on birth control (which can fail), he contributed to the pregnancy. The situation with the abortion was a mutual decision initially, but she changed her mind. That raises questions about autonomy and whether he pressured her. Also, after the child's birth, he's cutting off contact, which affects the child's well-being. \n\nFrom a legal perspective, child support is his responsibility, but emotional and relational involvement is another matter. However, the child has a right to a relationship with both parents. The author's refusal to engage, especially after hearing the child feels deprived of a father, suggests a conflict between his personal beliefs and the child's needs. \n\nThe author's perspective is that he wasn't ready and felt deceived. But C's actions might have been influenced by her mental health issues, which could be a factor in her decision-making. However, the deception aspect is complicated. Did he have a right to expect honesty if their relationship was built on different expectations?\n\nIn terms of societal judgment, many might see the author as neglecting his parental duties, especially since the child is growing up without a father figure. The guilt trip from the child is a significant emotional consequence. \n\nBalancing these factors, the author's decision not to be a father is his personal choice, but it has real impacts on the child. The lack of contact, despite paying support, might be seen as morally questionable because it affects the child's life. However, if the author believes he can't be a proper parent, is he wrong for not trying? It's a tough call. \n\nBut the key points are consent, autonomy, and the child's well-being. The author didn't prevent the pregnancy but contributed to it. His breaking up was a choice, but cutting off contact might be seen as the wrong decision. So, considering all aspects, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong, as the child's needs should be considered beyond legal obligations.\n"
