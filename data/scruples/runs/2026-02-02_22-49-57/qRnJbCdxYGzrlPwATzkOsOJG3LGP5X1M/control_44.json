C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. Let's start by breaking down the key points.\n\nFirst, the author was in a 3-year high school relationship with C. C has a troubled background with parents who abandoned her and her grandmother being devoutly Catholic. She has bipolar disorder, which caused some issues in the relationship. She was taking oral contraceptives, but they didn't use condoms. Then C was diagnosed with PCOS, which made her fear infertility. She got pregnant, hid it, and when confronted, denied knowing. The author wanted an abortion but she went through with the pregnancy after a \"miraculous\" event with the cat. The author broke up with her and hasn't been involved, only paying child support.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's look at both sides. On one hand, the author didn't want children and felt pressured by C. He tried to convince her to have an abortion, which she refused after the incident with the cat. He might feel forced into a situation he wasn't ready for. On the other hand, once the child was born, he's not involved, which is affecting the child emotionally. The mother's actions were deceptive (hiding pregnancy, pretending to not know), which is a problem. However, the author's decision to cut off contact after the breakup could be seen as abandoning his child. Child support is legally required, but emotional involvement is another matter.\n\nLegally, he's fulfilling his duty by paying support, but morally, not being part of the child's life is questionable. The child is starting school and asking about the father, which the author is aware of but still chooses not to engage. The author argues he wasn't ready, and the mother was selfish. However, once the child exists, the father has responsibilities beyond just legal ones. The mother's deception is a valid point, but the father's refusal to be part of the child's life could harm the child's well-being. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that he hasn't talked to the child in years and doesn't plan to. While he might have been wronged initially, the child's needs are separate from the parents' issues. The mother's actions were wrong, but that doesn't absolve the father of his responsibilities. The emotional impact on the child is significant, and the author's guilt might be a sign that he knows he's neglecting his duty. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author is in the wrong for not taking an active role in his child's life despite the circumstances. The mother's actions don't justify his neglect. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
