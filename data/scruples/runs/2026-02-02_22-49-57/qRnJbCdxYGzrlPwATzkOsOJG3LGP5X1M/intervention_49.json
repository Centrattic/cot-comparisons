C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his pregnant girlfriend. Let me start by summarizing the situation.\n\nThe author had a three-year relationship in high school with a girl named C. She had a tough upbringing, including parental issues and being raised by devout Catholic grandparents. She has bipolar disorder, which might have affected her emotional state. The author wasn't interested in marriage, but C wanted to start a family. She was on birth control, but they didn't use condoms, leading to pregnancy. She was initially told she had PCOS, which made her think she might not be able to conceive, which was a big deal for her. Then she got pregnant anyway, hid it, and when confronted, denied it. The author tried to get her to get an abortion, but when she went to the airport with her family to do so, her cat was hit by the car she was getting into, which they saw as a miracle to keep the child. The author broke up with her, didn't participate in the child's life, pays child support, but hasn't been in contact. Now the child is 5 and says he doesn't play with his dad, making the author feel guilty but not changing his stance. People judge him for this.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The user's initial thought is that he's not, but they want to know my take.\n\nFirst, let's consider the legal aspect. He is paying child support, so he's fulfilling that obligation. But in many places, child support is mandatory, so he's not necessarily avoiding it. However, in terms of being involved in the child's life, the law might vary, but ethically, there's debate. \n\nEthically, he might argue that he wasn't given a choice because the pregnancy was hidden. But the fact that they had unprotected sex means he was involved in creating the situation. However, she deceived him about her intentions and the pregnancy. That's a significant point. Deception can be a reason for a breakup, but it doesn't absolve him from responsibility towards the child. \n\nHe also tried to convince her to get an abortion, which she eventually refused due to the \"miracle\" of the cat. That might be a point where he could have pushed harder, but he did try. However, once the child is born, his responsibilities as a parent typically don't end just because of the circumstances of the pregnancy.\n\nThe child's well-being is a key factor. The child is growing up without a father figure and expressing that his daddy doesn't play with him. The author feels guilt but remains firm. This raises the question of whether cutting off contact is in the child's best interest. Even if the relationship with the mother is strained, the child deserves a relationship with the father if possible. \n\nOn the other hand, the author feels wronged because he wasn't ready and he wasn't given a choice. He might believe that by not engaging, he's protecting himself from a situation he's unprepared for. But children need both parents, ideally, and the father's absence can have lasting effects. \n\nAnother angle is that the mother's actions were manipulative. She may have used her mental health and the pregnancy to keep the child despite his objections. However, the author also used an ultimatum (me or the baby), which might have set a precedent for her to feel she had no choice but to proceed with the pregnancy after the \"miracle.\"\n\nIn terms of societal judgment, people might see the author as abandoning his child, but there's also the mother's actions to consider. The author's stance is that the mother was selfish in deceiving him and proceeding with the pregnancy against his wishes. However, once the child is born, the father's responsibility isn't optional. Even if he feels it's not his choice, in many ethical frameworks, the child's right to a relationship with both parents takes precedence.\n\nSo, balancing these factors: the author's initial decision to break up is understandable given the deception and the ultimatum rejection, but his long-term refusal to engage with the child could be seen as neglecting the child's needs. The mother's actions were problematic, but the father also has a role to play in the child's life.\n\nTherefore, while the author's perspective is valid and he was wronged in some ways, his current actions of cutting off contact might be considered unethical or in the wrong, as the child's well-being is paramount. So the answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong), because despite the circumstances, the child's right to a relationship with the father is important.\n"
