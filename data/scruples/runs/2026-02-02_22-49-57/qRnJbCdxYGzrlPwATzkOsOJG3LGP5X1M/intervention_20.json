C had a rather rough upbringing. Her father abandoned her as a child and her mother committed suicide by jumping in front of a train (only a few years before our relationship began). C was left to be cared by her grandparents who were devout Catholics. As a result C became highly religious herself. However, C has bipolar disorder. This wasn't obvious and manifested as erratic moods. \n\nAnyway, C had it in her head that she wanted to get married and have a family. At first she was patient because she thought I'd propose. When it became clear that I wasn't interested in doing so, C started to panic. C became more aggressive about it and we started to argue. Eventually C seemed to give up. But we were still sexually active. C had been taking oral contraceptives and we never used condoms (my bad) and I never thought anything of it. Then one day C was diagnosed with Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. She was told by a doctor that she'd be much less likely to conceive. This affected C deeply as she was more or less obsessed with the idea of starting a family. \n\nFast forward about 5 months (I don't remember exactly how long but it was a significant amount of time). It became clear that C was pregnant (with my child!). She succeeded in hiding it up until this point. When confronted she vehemently denied knowing she was pregnant and acted as surprised as anyone. Shocked and at a loss, I pleaded with her to get an abortion and pretty much gave her an ultimatum-me or the baby! It was all very emotional but finally I convinced C to get an abortion. Most doctors refused to perform the abortion this late into the pregnancy but were doctors in Melbourne who would do it. \n\nSo I booked plane tickets. It was all good to go. The morning of the flight, C was packed and literally getting into the car with her grandparents to be taken to the airport. Now get this, as they rolled out of the driveway, C's cat happened to be sitting behind the car. The cat was run over and died. C and her grandparents were shocked and saw no other option than to take this event as the occurrence a miracle (imagine that!) In their eyes it was confirmed-God wanted C to keep her child.\n\nSo she did. And I broke up with her shortly after. A few months later C gave birth to our son named N but I refused to take part. I haven't really talked to C since. I have been paying child support. To this day I have not so much as talked to N, although I have seen him a couple of times, despite that my parents see him and take care of him often. \n\nBasically everyone I know has judged me for abandoning my child and nobody hesitates to tell me I'm in the wrong. A lot of people have lost respect for me and see my continued lack of contact with my child as immoral. I've got into many fights with my parents over this and no longer live with them due to the discord. \n\nN is 5 years old now and stating to talk and go to school. Recently I was told by my mother that when N was playing with other children he was asked about his 'daddy' to which he replied: 'my daddy doesn't play with me'. This is concerning for me to hear and I can't help but feel guilty to some degree. However, I still feel that I've been wronged and at this stage it would be very difficult for me to reverse my decision. I have been firm about my decision all along and have no intention of validating C's disrespect for me by changing my mind now. I never wanted to have a child and she knew all along. She was being incredibly selfish, no matter how selfish I'm being now. \n\nBefore judging me I implore you to consider my perspective. I had no say in the matter and C deceived me (and everyone else) in order to fulfil her fantasy. This was extremely disrespectful and hurtful to me, I wasn't ready to have a child and I'm still not. AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a breakup after the girlfriend, who had a history of mental health issues and a strong desire for children, became pregnant despite using birth control. The author tried to get an abortion, but the girlfriend changed her mind after a \"miracle\" event with her cat. The author then left and hasn't been involved in the child's life, though he pays child support.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Legally, the father's responsibility in such cases varies by country, but generally, if the child is born, the father has legal obligations, including child support. The author is fulfilling that, which is good. However, the emotional and moral aspects are trickier.\n\nThe author feels he was wronged because the pregnancy was a result of deception and that the girlfriend was selfish. But he also didn't use condoms, and he was aware she was on birth control. So, maybe he's somewhat responsible too. The girlfriend had a mental health condition (bipolar and Catholic upbringing) which might have influenced her decisions. But was her decision to keep the child after the cat incident a result of her mental health? That's unclear, but it's a factor.\n\nThe author is now a father, whether he wanted it or not. By not being involved, he's denying his child a relationship. The child is now 5, and the comment about not playing with him is heartbreaking. The author's guilt is evident, but he's still firm in his decision. The key here is whether his initial rejection was justified. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, some might argue that once a child is born, the parent has a duty to be part of the child's life. Others might say the author was pressured into a situation he didn't consent to. However, the child is a product of their relationship, and the author's refusal to engage beyond financial support could be seen as irresponsible. The girlfriend's actions were selfish, but the author's current stance may also be selfish. \n\nThe author's perspective is important. He felt deceived and that his autonomy was taken away. But once the child is born, the dynamics change. The child has a right to know and have a relationship with both parents. The author's decision to cut ties might be his choice, but it's affecting the child's life. \n\nConsidering all this, the author might be in the wrong for not engaging with his child, even if he feels wronged initially. The responsibility of parenthood includes more than just financial support. However, the initial circumstances where the pregnancy was kept secret and the abortion attempt complicates things. The author's mental state and the girlfriend's mental health also play roles. It's a complex situation where both parties have issues, but the child's well-being is paramount. \n\nSo, while the author has valid reasons for feeling wronged, his current lack of involvement in his child's life could be seen as morally wrong. Therefore, the answer would be A (in the wrong).\n"
