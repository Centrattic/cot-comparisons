We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author yelling at their mother and husband for criticizing their daughter in front of her.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key elements. The daughter has a history of clinical depression and has been making significant progress\u2014getting a job, going back to school, and attending therapy. The husband and mother are criticizing her for being messy, specifically about the cat's litter box. The author steps in to defend the daughter, telling the mother and husband to be respectful or \"fuck off.\"\n\nThe main issue here seems to be about protecting a vulnerable family member. The daughter's mental health is a concern, and public criticism from family members could potentially trigger a relapse. The author's reaction is in defense of the daughter, which is a protective instinct. However, the method used\u2014a public outburst\u2014might be seen as harsh.\n\nBut considering the context, the daughter was already upset and feeling like a \"piece of shit,\" which indicates that the criticism had a severe emotional impact. The author's intervention might be justified to prevent further harm. The husband not apologizing adds to the tension, making the situation more stressful for the daughter.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's choice of words (\"fuck off\") is confrontational. While the intent was protective, the tone could be seen as disrespectful towards the mother and husband. However, given the emotional stakes and the daughter's well-being, the author's actions might be considered a necessary response to defend their child.\n\nThe question is whether the author's actions were in the wrong. The key factors are the daughter's mental health, the public criticism from family members, and the author's protective response. The author's primary goal was to shield their daughter from further emotional harm, which is a valid concern. The use of harsh language could be seen as a momentary lapse in judgment, but the underlying motive is protective and caring.\n\nIn summary, while the author's words were strong, the intent was to protect a vulnerable family member. The criticism from the husband and mother was inconsiderate, especially given the daughter's history. Therefore, the author's reaction, though intense, is a reasonable response to a harmful situation.\n"
