We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a daughter who's recovering from depression, moving back in with her parents. The daughter is making progress\u2014has a job, going to school, therapy. But she's a bit messy now, which the husband is annoyed about. The mother-in-law visits, and both she and the husband start criticizing the daughter in front of her, talking about her cat and her messiness. The daughter is upset, says she's a piece of shit. The author loses it, tells them to be respectful or fuck off, takes the daughter out. The parents-in-law are upset and haven't spoken since.\n\nHmm. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A for yes, B for no.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter is in a vulnerable state, recovering from depression. Public shaming from family could set her back. The author's husband and mother-in-law criticized her in front of her, which is probably not helpful. The daughter was clearly upset, even crying and self-deprecating. \n\nThe author's reaction was to stand up for their daughter. They got angry and told the parents and husband to back off. The author felt the need to protect their daughter's mental health. But did they overreact?\n\nOn one hand, yelling and using strong language (\"fuck off\") might be seen as inappropriate. Family dynamics can be complex, and sometimes communication is key. But on the other hand, the parents and husband were being unkind and public in their criticism, which could harm the daughter's recovery. The author's daughter was emotionally hurt, and the author intervened to stop the negativity.\n\nThe husband didn't apologize when the daughter said he hurt her feelings. The mother continued the criticism after coming back in. The author's outburst was a response to protect their daughter's well-being. \n\nIs the author wrong for reacting that way? Maybe not. The situation was about protecting a loved one's mental health. While the method was harsh, the intent was to stop the emotional abuse. The author might not be in the wrong. The key points are the daughter's vulnerability and the public shaming by the other family members. The author's action was a defense against that. So probably answer B.\n"
