We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for yelling at their mother and husband in front of their daughter. The situation involves the daughter's messiness, which the husband and mother criticized in front of her, leading to her emotional breakdown.\n\nFirst, the daughter has been through a tough time recovering from depression and recently moved back in. She's making progress with a job, school, and therapy. The husband's venting and the mother's agreement in front of her could be incredibly hurtful, especially given her history. The daughter's reaction\u2014sobbing and feeling like a \"piece of shit\"\u2014shows the emotional impact.\n\nThe author intervened when the criticism continued even after the daughter was upset. Yelling and telling them to \"fuck off\" was a strong reaction, but it's in defense of their daughter's well-being. The key here is the context: the daughter's mental health is fragile. The parents and husband's public criticism might have been triggering. The author's action was to protect the daughter from further harm, even if it was confrontational.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The criticism was happening in a public setting, in front of the daughter, who was already vulnerable. The author's response, while harsh, was a direct attempt to stop the emotional abuse. The husband didn't apologize, and the mother continued. The author's actions were protective, not just out of anger. They might have felt a responsibility to defend their daughter, especially when others were contributing to her self-esteem issues.\n\nOn the other hand, yelling could be seen as inappropriate. But the alternative is allowing the daughter to be further criticized, which could set back her recovery. The author's actions were a reaction to protect their daughter's mental health. The husband and mother might be in the wrong for not respecting the daughter's boundaries and her current state.\n\nSo, balancing both sides, the author's actions were justified given the circumstances. They prioritized their daughter's well-being over social niceties. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
