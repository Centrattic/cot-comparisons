We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The story is about a situation where the author yelled at their husband and mother because they were being critical of their daughter in front of her, which upset the daughter. The daughter had been struggling with depression and was doing well, but this incident made her feel bad again. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The author's husband and mother were talking about the daughter's messiness and the cat's litter box in front of her. The daughter was already dealing with depression and had made progress, so being criticized in front of others might have triggered her feelings of inadequacy. The author intervened by telling her husband and mother to shut up or leave, which is a strong reaction.\n\nNow, the key points here are the intentions and the context. The author's main concern was protecting their daughter's mental health. They felt that the husband and mother's comments were hurtful and could set her back. The author's outburst was a direct response to protect the daughter. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband and mother might believe they were just giving their opinion or trying to help, but they did it in a public setting which is inappropriate. The husband didn't apologize when the daughter was upset, which doesn't help the situation. The mother also continued the criticism despite the daughter's emotional state.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's action was a reaction to protect their child. While yelling is a strong method, the underlying reason is valid\u2014preventing emotional harm to someone who's vulnerable. However, the use of such strong language might be seen as crossing a line, but the context of the daughter's mental health is crucial here. \n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. Since the husband and mother's behavior was inappropriate, the author's defense of their daughter seems justified. The answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they acted to protect their daughter from harmful criticism, especially considering her history with depression. However, the author might be advised to handle such situations more calmly in the future, but in this case, the immediate response was to prevent further harm.\n"
