We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the story is in the wrong (AITA). The scenario involves a daughter recovering from depression, her parents and mother-in-law criticizing her in front of her, and the mother-in-law losing her temper.\n\nFirst, the daughter has made significant progress in her recovery. She got a job, is in school, and in therapy. The parents and mother-in-law criticized her for being messy and not taking care of the cat. They did this in front of her, which is pretty harsh. The mother-in-law's husband didn't apologize, and the mother and father continued berating her after the daughter was upset. \n\nThe author (the mother) then yelled at her husband and mother-in-law, telling them to be respectful or leave. She took her daughter to calm down. Now, the family isn't speaking to her, and she's feeling bad but also protective of her daughter's mental health.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Well, public criticism can be damaging, especially for someone in recovery. The parents and mother-in-law's behavior might have triggered the daughter, risking her progress. The mother intervened to protect her daughter, which is a natural parental instinct. While yelling is not ideal, the context is important. She was defending her child from ongoing criticism that was making her feel like a \"piece of shit.\" \n\nThe key points are the daughter's mental health, the public shaming, and the lack of support from the husband and mother-in-law. The mother's reaction was a response to protect her child, so she's not entirely in the wrong. However, maybe she could have handled it differently. But given the circumstances, her actions were driven by concern for her daughter's well-being. So, I think the answer is B (No).\n"
