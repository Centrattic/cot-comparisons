We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. I need to analyze the situation based on the details provided.\n\nFirst, the key points: The daughter is recovering from depression, has taken on a job, going to school, and therapy. She's making progress but is still struggling with being a slob, which is being criticized by the husband and mother in front of her. The mother-in-law and husband are berating her about the cat's litter box, which the author is already handling. The daughter is emotionally hurt, crying, and feeling like a \"piece of shit.\" The author then loses their temper and tells them to fuck off, leading to a fallout.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The daughter is in a vulnerable state, working hard to improve her life. Public criticism from family members, especially when she's already dealing with mental health issues, can be really damaging. The husband and mother not apologizing and continuing to berate her in front of her is problematic. The author's reaction was a defense of their daughter's emotional well-being. While yelling and using harsh language might not be ideal, the intent was to protect their daughter from further harm.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's approach might have been impulsive. Maybe they could have handled it differently, like addressing the issue privately later. However, the immediate context was a public shaming situation causing emotional distress. The author's actions were a reaction to protect their daughter's mental health, which is a valid concern.\n\nAlso, the relationships are generally good, but this incident highlights a conflict between the author and their family. The author's usual tolerance for their daughter's messiness shows they understand the challenges their daughter is facing. The mother and husband's public criticism seems insensitive, especially given the daughter's progress and the author's role in supporting her.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is whether the action was justified given the circumstances. The author's outburst was in response to their daughter being emotionally attacked. While the method might not be ideal, the intention to protect their daughter from harm is understandable. The family's behavior towards the daughter is arguably more at fault here.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They acted to defend their daughter from verbal abuse, which is a protective measure. The answer should be B.\n"
