We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong (AITA). The scenario involves a daughter with depression who's doing well but is being criticized by her father and mother-in-law in front of her. The author, the mother, lost her temper and told them to \"fuck off.\" \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter has a history of depression, which is a serious mental health issue. The father and mother-in-law criticized her in front of her, which could be really hurtful. The daughter was already crying and feeling like a \"piece of shit,\" which is a sign of low self-esteem, possibly exacerbated by their comments.\n\nThe author's response was to confront them, which might be seen as defensive of her daughter. But the question is whether she was in the wrong. Yelling and using strong language like \"fuck off\" is harsh, but the motivation here was to protect her daughter from further emotional harm. The father and mother-in-law didn't apologize, so they might have contributed to the situation.\n\nOn one hand, using such language isn't ideal and could have been handled more calmly. On the other hand, the daughter's mental health is at stake. The author might have felt that the immediate need was to stop the negative comments to prevent a relapse. The family dynamics here are complex, with the mother and husband usually having a good relationship, but this specific interaction was harmful.\n\nI should also consider cultural or societal norms. In some contexts, confronting family members in this way might be seen as overreacting, but in others, standing up for a vulnerable family member could be justified. The key factors are the daughter's well-being and the fact that the parents' comments were public and hurtful.\n\nSo, weighing the intent (protecting the daughter) against the method (yelling and harsh language), it's possible that the author isn't in the wrong because her action was a reaction to protect her daughter's mental health. However, the method could have been better. But the core issue is the harm caused by the parents' comments. In AITA situations, the community often considers the intent and the context heavily. Since the daughter's mental health is a priority, the author's actions might be seen as justified despite the harsh language. Therefore, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
