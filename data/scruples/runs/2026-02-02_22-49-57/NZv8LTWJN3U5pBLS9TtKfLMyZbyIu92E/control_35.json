We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The question is about a situation where the author told their mother and husband to fuck off after they criticized their daughter in front of her.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the full context. The daughter was dealing with depression and has been making progress. She moved in with her parents, and the husband is annoyed by her messiness. The mother and husband discussed this in front of the daughter, leading to the daughter feeling hurt and the author losing their temper. They then yelled at the mother and husband, causing a fallout.\n\nI need to consider the dynamics here. The daughter was vulnerable, having just come out of a tough time. Public criticism from family members could have a negative impact on her mental health. The author intervened to protect their daughter, which might be seen as justified given the circumstances. However, the response was harsh\u2014using a strong expletive. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband and mother might have had intentions of helping, but their approach was inconsiderate. The husband didn't apologize when his daughter was upset, which is problematic. The mother supported the criticism in front of the daughter, adding to the hurt.\n\nThe author's actions were a reaction to protect their child's feelings. While the method was aggressive, the motivation was to prevent further harm to the daughter's mental health. In some contexts, this might be seen as a justified outburst given the emotional stakes. However, the use of such strong language could be viewed as crossing a line, even if the intent was good.\n\nBut considering the daughter's mental health is a priority, and the parents' approach was harmful, the author's intervention was necessary. The question is whether the response was proportionate. The author had never spoken like that before, indicating it was a last resort after seeing their daughter in distress.\n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether the intervention was justified given the potential harm to the daughter. If protecting a child's mental health is a higher priority than avoiding harsh language, then the author isn't in the wrong. Alternatively, if the method of response is considered excessive, then they might be. But the key here is that the criticism was happening in front of the daughter, which was the trigger for the outburst.\n"
