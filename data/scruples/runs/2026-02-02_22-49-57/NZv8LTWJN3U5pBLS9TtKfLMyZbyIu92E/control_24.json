We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for yelling at their mother and husband. The situation is that the daughter is trying to recover from depression, and the husband and mother criticized her in front of her, leading to her emotional breakdown. The author stepped in to defend her daughter by telling them off.\n\nSo, first, the daughter has been making progress in her recovery. The husband and mother's public criticism could be really damaging, especially since she's in therapy and has a lot on her plate. The mother and father didn't apologize, which probably made things worse. The author's reaction was to defend their daughter, which seems like a protective instinct. They took the daughter out to calm her down, showing they acted in her best interest.\n\nThe key points here are the mental health of the daughter and the public shaming by the husband and mother. The author's outburst was a response to protect their daughter from further harm. While yelling isn't ideal, the context is important. The daughter was already vulnerable, and the parents' behavior could set back her progress. The author felt that their usual leniency towards the daughter's messiness wasn't respected, and the criticism was inconsiderate.\n\nHowever, the author did use harsh language, which might be seen as reactive. But considering the daughter's emotional state and the parents' refusal to back down, the author's actions were a necessary intervention. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given the circumstances, protecting a loved one's mental health is crucial. The author's actions, while not the most composed, were motivated by a desire to support their daughter's well-being. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have handled it differently, like calmly addressing the issue without yelling. But in the heat of the moment, especially seeing their daughter in distress, the reaction seems justified. The parents also didn't take responsibility, so the author's stand makes sense. \n\nI think the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because they were protecting their daughter from emotional harm. The parents' behavior was the initial problem, and the author's response, though harsh, was a defense mechanism for the daughter's mental health.\n"
