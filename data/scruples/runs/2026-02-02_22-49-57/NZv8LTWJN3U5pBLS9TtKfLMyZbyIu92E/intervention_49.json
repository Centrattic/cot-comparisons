We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. They said they think the author isn't, but want my opinion.\n\nSo, the situation: The author's daughter is dealing with depression, made a recovery, and is doing well with a job, school, and therapy. The husband is annoyed by her messiness, which the author thinks is due to her past depression. The mother-in-law visits, and both the husband and mother criticize the daughter in front of her, specifically about the cat's litter box. The daughter becomes upset, says she's a \"piece of shit,\" and the author snaps, telling them to respect her or leave. The author then takes the daughter out, and now there's a rift with the mother and husband.\n\nFirst, the daughter is in a vulnerable state. She's been through a lot, and her mental health is a concern. The parents are criticizing her in front of her, which is pretty harsh. The husband not apologizing when the daughter says he hurt her feelings is a red flag. The mother-in-law agreeing and adding to the criticism isn't helping.\n\nThe author's outburst was in defense of their daughter's mental health. The daughter was crying and feeling attacked. The author's reaction seems to be a protective measure. They were trying to stop a harmful situation. Even though yelling is intense, the underlying reason is valid. The husband and mother weren't considering the daughter's mental state when they criticized her. The author's main concern is their daughter's well-being, which is a strong justification for their actions.\n\nBut maybe there's another angle. Did the author handle it the best way? Maybe a less confrontational approach could have been taken, but given the immediate emotional distress, the author's response was a reaction to protect their child. The husband and mother's actions were inappropriate, and the author stepped in to stop them.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. Their actions were in defense of their daughter's emotional health. The husband and mother's behavior was the real issue here. Therefore, answer B.\n"
