We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a bit complex. The user is asking if they're at fault for telling their mother and husband to fuck off after they criticized their daughter in front of her.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The daughter, who's 26, moved back in with her parents after a tough breakup and depression. She's improved a lot, getting a job, going to school, and therapy. The husband and mother criticized her for being a slob, specifically about the cat's litter box, in front of her. The daughter was upset, and the author intervened by yelling at them. \n\nSo, the main issue here is the public criticism of the daughter by the husband and mother. The author's reaction was to tell them to fuck off, which is strong language, but their reasoning is to protect their daughter's mental health. The daughter was already vulnerable due to her depression, and the public shaming might push her back into that state.\n\nThe user is asking if they're in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLet me break it down. The husband and mother's actions: they publicly criticized the daughter, which is hurtful, especially given her history. The daughter's emotional response was crying and feeling like a piece of shit. The author stepped in to defend her daughter. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, public shaming can be very damaging, especially to someone with a history of depression. The author's intervention, while using harsh language, was in defense of their daughter's well-being. The husband's lack of apology adds to the problem. \n\nBut is the author wrong for their reaction? Well, yelling and using profanity can be seen as inappropriate, but the context is that they were protecting a vulnerable family member. The alternative would be letting the criticism continue, which could harm the daughter. \n\nSo, considering the intent and the situation, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. They acted to prevent further harm to their daughter. However, the method might be debatable. But the core action\u2014defending their daughter from unkind public criticism\u2014seems justified. \n\nAlso, the daughter was already making progress, and public humiliation could regress her. The author's anger was a response to protect her. The husband and mother were in the wrong for their comments, so the author's reaction was a form of standing up against their behavior. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
