We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves family dynamics where the daughter is recovering from depression, and the mother and husband criticized her in front of her, leading to her emotional breakdown. The author, who is the daughter's parent, lost their temper and told her parent and spouse to \"fuck off\" or leave the daughter alone.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The daughter is making progress in her recovery, which is a positive sign. The daughter's messiness is a concern, but the parents are handling it differently. The mother-in-law and husband criticized her in front of her, which is a red flag because public criticism can be harmful, especially for someone with a history of depression. The daughter's emotional response is a direct result of their actions, indicating that their comments were hurtful and inappropriate.\n\nThe author intervened to protect their daughter, which is a protective instinct. The husband not apologizing when the daughter was upset adds to the problem. The mother-in-law's continued criticism after the daughter started crying shows a lack of empathy. The author's reaction, though harsh, was in response to their loved ones hurting their child, which could be seen as a justified defense of the daughter's well-being.\n\nHowever, using such strong language as \"fuck off\" might be seen as excessive by some. But considering the context\u2014protecting a vulnerable family member from public shaming and potential regression in her mental health\u2014the action might be understood as a reaction to protect their daughter. The question is whether the method was appropriate, but the intent was to defend their child.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers the intent and the context. Here, the author's intent was protective, even if the method was harsh. The mother and husband's actions were the root cause of the problem. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for defending their daughter against public criticism that could harm her mental health.\n"
