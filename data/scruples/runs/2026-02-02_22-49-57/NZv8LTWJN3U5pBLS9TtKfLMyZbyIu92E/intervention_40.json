We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for telling her mother and husband to \"fuck off\" after they criticized her daughter in front of her. \n\nFirst, the context: The daughter has a history of depression, recently moved back in, and is making progress in her recovery by getting a job, going to school, and attending therapy. The husband and mother-in-law are upset about her being a slob, specifically mentioning her cat's litter box. They're criticizing her publicly, which upsets the daughter to the point of crying and self-deprecation.\n\nThe author intervened when they saw the daughter's mental state deteriorating. They felt it was necessary to protect her daughter from further harm. The key points here are the daughter's mental health and the public shaming by the husband and mother. Publicly berating someone with a history of depression can be harmful, especially if they're trying to recover. The author's outburst was a reaction to protect their child's emotional well-being.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. The husband and mother might not have realized how their comments could affect the daughter. However, the author's response was direct and aggressive, which could be seen as overreacting. But given the daughter's vulnerability and the fact that the criticism was in her presence, the author's action might be justified as a protective measure. \n\nOn the other hand, using strong language like \"fuck off\" is undeniably harsh and could damage relationships. The author admits they've never spoken to them like that before, which suggests it was a moment of high emotion. The question is whether the intention (to protect their child's mental health) justifies the method (aggressive language). \n\nIn many cases, while the intent is noble, the approach is still problematic. However, the scenario emphasizes that the daughter was already struggling and that the criticism could set her back. The author's fear for their daughter's well-being adds context. So, while the language was inappropriate, the underlying motivation was protective. \n\nThe answer hinges on balancing the author's responsibility to address the situation versus the method they used. Since the daughter's mental health is a priority, the author might not be in the wrong, but they might need to address the communication style. The final choice is B (No), because the core issue is the daughter's well-being, and the author acted to prevent further harm, even if the response was unorthodox.\n"
