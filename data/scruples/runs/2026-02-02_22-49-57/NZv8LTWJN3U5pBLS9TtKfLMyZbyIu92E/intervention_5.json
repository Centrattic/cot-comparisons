We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the daughter is doing a lot to recover from depression, like getting a job, going to school, and therapy. She's also dealing with being messy, which the husband is annoyed about. The mother and husband talk about this in front of the daughter, even bringing up the cat's litter box that the author has been cleaning. Then the daughter gets upset, and the author loses it, telling them to fuck off or leave.\n\nHmm, the daughter's progress is important. The parents are criticizing her in front of her, which could really hurt her self-esteem, especially since she's recovering. The author is trying to protect her daughter from negative comments that might set her back. The husband didn't apologize when the daughter was upset, and the mother kept berating her even after she was crying. That seems pretty harsh.\n\nThe author's response was to yell and tell them to leave, which is rude, but maybe justified given the context? They were defending their daughter against public criticism that could affect her mental health. The author probably felt that they had to step in to stop the parents from causing harm. The daughter's reaction of feeling like a piece of shit is serious. It's possible that the author's anger was a last resort to protect their child.\n\nOn the other hand, using such strong language might not be the best approach. But considering the emotional state of the daughter and the parents' behavior, maybe the author's actions were a necessary boundary. The key here is whether the parents' actions were harmful and if the author overreacted. Since the daughter was already vulnerable, the criticism might have been a trigger. The author's action, while harsh, could be seen as protecting their child from further harm.\n\nSo, I think the author isn't in the wrong because they were defending their daughter from potentially harmful criticism that could set her recovery back. The parents were in the wrong for talking about the daughter in such a hurtful way in front of her. The author's outburst was a response to protect their child's mental health.\n"
