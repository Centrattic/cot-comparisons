We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for yelling at their mother and husband after they criticized their daughter in front of her. \n\nFirst, the daughter was coming off a period of depression and has made significant progress. She's working, going to school, and in therapy. The daughter's messiness is a concern, but the parents are trying to cut her some slack. Then the husband and mother-in-law come in and berate her in front of her, which causes her to break down. The author steps in, losing their temper, and tells them to stop or leave. They took the daughter out to calm her down, and now there's a rift with the mother and husband.\n\nI need to consider if the author's reaction was justified. The key points here are the daughter's mental health, the public criticism, and the emotional impact. The daughter was already struggling with depression, and the criticism might trigger a relapse. The parents' approach of venting in front of her seems unkind and could be seen as undermining her progress. The author intervened to protect their daughter's mental health, which is a valid concern. \n\nHowever, yelling and using a harsh phrase like \"fuck off\" might be seen as overreacting. Even though the situation was stressful, the method of response is aggressive. But given the context of protecting a vulnerable daughter, maybe it's understandable. The question is whether the author's actions were wrong. On one hand, standing up for their daughter in a crisis is protective. On the other hand, the way they did it could be seen as disrespectful to their mother and husband.\n\nBut the main issue is the impact on the daughter. The parents' actions were the initial problem, so the author's reaction was a defense of their child. In that light, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The parents weren't being supportive, and the daughter's well-being is the priority. So the answer might be B\u2014No, the author isn't in the wrong. They acted to protect their daughter's mental health, even if the method was harsh. The responsibility lies with the husband and mother for their unkind words in front of the daughter.\n"
