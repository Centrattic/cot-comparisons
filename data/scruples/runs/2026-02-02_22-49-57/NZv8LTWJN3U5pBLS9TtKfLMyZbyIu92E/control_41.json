We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves their daughter who's recovering from depression and dealing with some challenges. The daughter has made a lot of progress, getting a job, going to school, and seeing a therapist. The parents and mother-in-law are criticizing her for being a slob and not taking care of the cat, which leads to the author losing their temper and telling them to fuck off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter is in a vulnerable state, coming out of a serious depression. Public criticism from family members could really hurt her mental health. The author is trying to protect her daughter, which is a valid concern. The husband and mother-in-law brought up the issue in front of the daughter, which was probably not the right approach. They didn't consider how that might affect her feelings, especially since she's still recovering.\n\nThe author intervened when the daughter was upset, which shows they were trying to defend her. The outburst was a reaction to the continued criticism even after the daughter was crying. The author's main concern was the daughter's well-being. While yelling and using harsh language isn't ideal, the intention was to stop the hurtful comments. \n\nHowever, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. They did use strong language, which isn't the most respectful way to handle a conflict. But the alternative was allowing the daughter to be further criticized, which could have negative consequences. The husband not apologizing and the mother continuing the criticism after the daughter was upset adds to the tension. The author's actions were a response to protect their child, which is a strong justification. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe there's a better way to handle such a situation without losing one's temper. But given the emotional state of the daughter and the immediate threat to her mental health, the author's reaction might be understandable. The key points are the daughter's progress, the public criticism, and the immediate need to defend her. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's intent was protective, even if the method was harsh. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong). But I should check if there's any other angle. The author could have addressed it calmly instead of yelling, but given the circumstances, their reaction makes sense. The husband and mother were being unkind, so defending the daughter is justified. So, the answer is B.\n"
