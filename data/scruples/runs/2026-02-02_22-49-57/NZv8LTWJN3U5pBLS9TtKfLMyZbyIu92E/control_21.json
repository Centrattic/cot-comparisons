We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's daughter has been through a tough time with depression and is now doing better. The husband and mother criticize her in front of her, which upsets the daughter. The author then yells at them, telling them to either be respectful or \"fuck off.\" \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter is doing well despite her challenges, and the criticism from her father and mother might be harmful, especially given her history. The author steps in to protect her daughter's feelings, which seems like a positive intent. But the method used was yelling and using harsh language.\n\nNow, is the author wrong for doing that? Well, the intention was to protect the daughter from hurtful comments, which is understandable. However, the way they reacted was confrontational. Using strong language like \"fuck off\" might not be the best approach, but maybe the stress of the situation made it necessary. \n\nThe author's actions were a response to a situation where their daughter was being emotionally attacked. The mother and husband were in the wrong for publicly berating the daughter, especially regarding her mental health and responsibilities. The author intervened to stop the bullying, which could be seen as justified, even if the words were harsh.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could have handled it more calmly, like asking them to stop the conversation privately. But given the daughter's emotional state, immediate action was taken. The question is whether the action itself was wrong. Since the goal was to protect the daughter's well-being, which is a valid concern, the author's actions might be justified even if the method was not ideal. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the intent was to protect a vulnerable family member from harmful criticism.\n"
