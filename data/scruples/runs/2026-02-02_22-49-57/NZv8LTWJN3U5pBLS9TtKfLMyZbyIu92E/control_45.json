We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a person who, along with their husband, is taking care of their daughter who has depression and has been working on improving her life. The daughter has a lot going on with a job, school, and therapy. The problem arises when the husband and mother criticize the daughter's messiness in front of her, even bringing up her cat's litter box. The daughter gets emotionally hurt, and the husband doesn't apologize. The author then confronts the two and tells them to either be respectful or \"fuck off,\" leading to a fallout where they haven't spoken to the author since.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the daughter is in a fragile mental health state, the parents are criticizing her in front of her, and the author steps in to defend her. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for their outburst.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter is doing well considering her depression, but the parents are publicly shaming her for something that's a minor issue given her circumstances. The husband's venting in front of her is unkind and possibly harmful, especially considering her mental state. The mother's agreement adds to the pressure. The author's reaction is a direct response to protect their daughter from emotional harm. While the language used (\"fuck off\") is strong, the intent was to stop the criticism and support their daughter.\n\nOn the other hand, using such a strong expletive might be seen as unprofessional or disrespectful, but the situation's context is crucial. The author was likely acting out of a sense of urgency to protect their daughter's mental health. The husband and mother's behavior contributed to the daughter's emotional breakdown, so the author's intervention might be justified as a necessary action to prevent further harm.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often weighs the intent behind actions and the context. Here, the author's intent was to defend their daughter, who was in a vulnerable state. The husband and mother's actions were unkind and triggered the daughter's self-deprecating thoughts. The author's outburst, while harsh in language, was a response to an ongoing situation that required immediate intervention. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong because they prioritized their daughter's well-being over maintaining a calm conversation.\n\nHowever, there's a consideration of whether the author handled it the best way possible. Maybe a different approach could have been taken, like pulling the husband and mother aside after the fact. But given the immediate emotional distress of the daughter, the author's reaction seems understandable. The community might see this as a justified stand to protect a loved one, especially when the parents were undermining the daughter's progress and mental health.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong because they acted to protect their daughter from harmful criticism, which was especially damaging given her mental health struggles. The answer would be B (No).\n"
