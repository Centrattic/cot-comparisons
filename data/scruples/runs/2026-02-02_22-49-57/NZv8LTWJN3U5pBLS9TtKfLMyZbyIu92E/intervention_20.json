We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at their mother and husband after they criticized their daughter in front of her. \n\nFirst, the context: The daughter has been through a tough time with depression and is now improving. The husband and mother are criticizing her for being messy and not taking care of the cat, which the author handles. The daughter is emotionally fragile, and the parents' comments made her cry and feel bad about herself. \n\nThe author intervened by telling her mother and husband to stop or leave. The key points here are the intent and the impact. The author's main concern was protecting their daughter's mental health. They felt that the criticism from family members could set her back, which is valid given her history. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author's reaction was wrong. Yelling is a strong response, but it's in defense of their daughter. The husband didn't apologize and continued the criticism, so the author acted to stop the immediate harm. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, standing up for a vulnerable family member, especially when they're struggling with mental health, is understandable. The author's outburst was a reaction to protect their child's well-being. However, using profanity might be seen as harsh, but given the circumstances, it could be justified as a last resort. \n\nThe mother and husband's actions were inappropriate for discussing such issues in front of the daughter, which also contributed to the situation. The author's response, while intense, was in response to a harmful situation. So, the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
