We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is at fault for yelling at their mother and husband after they criticized their daughter in front of her. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The daughter has been recovering from depression and has made significant progress. She's working, in school, and in therapy. The husband and mother criticized her for being messy and not taking care of the cat, which upset her. The mother and husband continued berating her even after she was upset, leading the author to snap and tell them to fuck off.\n\nThe key points here are the intentions and the context. The author's main concern is their daughter's mental health. They intervened to protect her from further harm after seeing her emotionally distressed. The husband and mother, on the other hand, were publicly criticizing her, which might not have been constructive, especially given her history with depression.\n\nThe author's reaction was an emotional response to protect their daughter, which is a valid concern. However, the method they used\u2014yelling and using harsh language\u2014might be seen as reactive. But considering the context of the daughter's mental health, the author's actions could be viewed as justified in the moment. \n\nAlso, the husband didn't apologize when the daughter was upset, and the mother continued the criticism. The author stepped in to stop the negativity, which might be seen as a necessary action to maintain a supportive environment for the daughter. So while the language used was strong, the underlying reason is about protecting a vulnerable family member. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often considers the intent and the broader context. Since the author's intent was to protect their daughter from harmful criticism, especially during her recovery, it's likely they're not in the wrong. So the answer would be B, No.\n"
