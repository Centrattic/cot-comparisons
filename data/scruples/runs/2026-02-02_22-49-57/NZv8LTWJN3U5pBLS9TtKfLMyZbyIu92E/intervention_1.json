We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves a daughter who's overcoming depression, her parents and mother-in-law criticizing her in front of her, and the mother (the author) snapping at them.\n\nFirst, the daughter has made significant progress in her recovery, which is commendable. The husband and mother are criticizing her for being a slob and not taking care of her cat, which they do in front of her. The daughter gets emotionally upset, and the author steps in to defend her by yelling and telling them to shut up or leave. \n\nThe key points here are the intentions and the context. The author's main concern is her daughter's mental health. She's trying to support her recovery, which is crucial. The husband and mother, on the other hand, might not realize how their comments are affecting the daughter. Public criticism can be damaging, especially for someone with depression. The author's outburst was a reaction to protect her daughter, which seems justified given the emotional state of the daughter. \n\nHowever, the method of intervention\u2014yelling and using harsh language\u2014might be seen as inappropriate. But considering the circumstances, the emotional stakes are high. The husband not apologizing and the mother continuing the criticism after the daughter is upset adds to the tension. The author's actions were a last resort to stop further harm to her daughter's mental health. \n\nSo, while the method could be questioned, the underlying motivation is protective. The author is defending her child from harmful criticism, which is a valid concern. The answer is likely B (not in the wrong) because the intent was to protect her daughter's well-being, even if the approach was confrontational.\n"
