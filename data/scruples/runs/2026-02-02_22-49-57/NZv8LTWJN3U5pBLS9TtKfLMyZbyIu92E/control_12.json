We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong. The situation involves their daughter moving in with them after a breakup and dealing with depression. The daughter has shown improvement, but there's a conflict about her being a slob and not taking care of the cat. The husband and mother criticize her in front of her, leading the author to yell at them and tell them to fuck off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The daughter is struggling with mental health, has made significant progress, and the criticism from her father and mother-in-law could be harmful. The author intervened to protect their daughter, which is a parental instinct. However, the method used was yelling and using harsh language.\n\nNow, evaluating the rightness or wrongness. On one hand, the parents might have a point about the daughter's behavior, but they did it in a public way that hurt her feelings. The husband not apologizing adds to the problem. On the other hand, the author's reaction was out of frustration and a desire to protect the daughter. Yelling and using strong language is not ideal, but the underlying motivation was to support the daughter's mental health.\n\nThe daughter's mental state is a crucial factor. If the criticism triggers a relapse, it's serious. The author's action, while harsh, might be seen as a necessary defense. However, there's a balance between protecting a child and maintaining family relationships. The author did isolate themselves, which might not be the best approach long-term, but in the heat of the moment, it's understandable.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the husband and mother had the issue of discussing the daughter's shortcomings in front of her, which is unkind. The author's outburst was a reaction to that. So the author might not be in the wrong, but perhaps could have handled it differently. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not about the best possible action. The core issue is the public criticism leading to emotional harm, which the author tried to stop. Therefore, the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
