We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong for yelling at her mother and husband after they criticized her daughter in front of her.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The daughter has a history of depression and has been making progress. The parents are trying to support her, but the husband is frustrated with her messiness, and the mother-in-law is in on the criticism. The parents-in-law criticized the daughter in front of her, leading to her emotional breakdown. The author intervened, telling them to stop or leave, which caused a rift.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The daughter is vulnerable, dealing with mental health issues. Public criticism from family can really affect someone's self-esteem, especially when they're recovering. The husband not apologizing when the daughter is hurt is problematic. The mother-in-law also didn't stop the criticism, even when the daughter was clearly upset. \n\nThe author's reaction was to defend her daughter. While using strong language like \"fuck off\" isn't the most respectful, the motivation was to protect her daughter's mental health. The key here is the intent versus the method. The author was trying to shield her daughter from harmful criticism, which is a valid concern. However, the way she expressed it might have been harsh, leading to the current conflict.\n\nBut is she in the wrong? The parents-in-law were the ones who started the criticism in front of the daughter, which could set back her recovery. The author's outburst was a reaction to protect her daughter. While the language was extreme, the underlying reason is about protecting a vulnerable family member. In many cases, people might empathize with the author's desire to defend her daughter's emotional well-being. The husband's lack of apology also suggests a failure to support the daughter, which the author is trying to correct.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's action, while harsh, was in response to protect her daughter's mental health. Therefore, she's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
