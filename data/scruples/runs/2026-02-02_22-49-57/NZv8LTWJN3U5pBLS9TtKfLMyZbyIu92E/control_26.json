We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a parent whose daughter is doing well after overcoming depression but is struggling with being a bit messy. The husband and mother-in-law criticized the daughter in front of her, which upset her. The author lost her temper and told them to fuck off. Now they're not speaking to each other. The author is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The daughter has a history of depression and is making progress. Public criticism from family members could potentially trigger a relapse. The author intervened to protect their daughter's mental health. That seems like a valid concern. Parents often want to shield their children from harsh criticism, especially when they're vulnerable.\n\nHowever, the author's response was to yell and use a strong expletive. While understandable in the moment, swearing can sometimes escalate tensions. But given the daughter's emotional state and the fact that the parents weren't apologizing, maybe the author felt there was no other choice to stop the negative interaction.\n\nThe key points here are the motivation and the circumstances. The author acted to defend their daughter from harmful comments that were hurting her. The method was harsh, but the intent was protective. On the other hand, the husband and mother-in-law were being critical in a public setting, which isn't great parenting. The author might have handled it differently, but given the daughter's mental health, their actions were in her best interest.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they were trying to protect their daughter's well-being. The criticism from the family was harmful, and the author took a stand. While the language was strong, the situation warranted a strong reaction. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
