We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The story is about a woman who got angry at her husband and mother for criticizing her daughter in front of her, especially after the daughter has been struggling with depression and is recovering. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The daughter has a lot going on\u2014new job, school, therapy. The parents are supportive, but the husband is annoyed by the daughter's messiness, which the mother-in-law agrees with. They criticize her in front of her, leading the daughter to feel bad about herself. The author steps in, yells at them to stop or leave, and the family is now not talking.\n\nThe key points here are the daughter's mental health history and the public criticism from the husband and mother. The author's reaction was to protect her daughter from further harm, which makes sense given the daughter's vulnerability. The husband didn't apologize, and the mother didn't stop, which might have escalated the situation.\n\nBut was the author wrong to yell? Well, yelling can be seen as harsh, but considering the context\u2014trying to protect a child's mental health\u2014it might be understandable. The alternative could have been letting the daughter internalize the criticism, which could set back her recovery. The author's actions were motivated by a desire to support her daughter, which is a valid reason.\n\nOn the other hand, using strong language like \"fuck off\" might have alienated the husband and mother, but the author likely felt it was necessary to stop the immediate harm. The question is whether the method was wrong or the intention was right. Since the daughter was at risk of emotional harm, the author's reaction, though intense, was protective. \n\nSo, in terms of right and wrong, the author's intent was to help her daughter, and the situation called for immediate intervention. The husband and mother's criticism was unhelpful and inconsiderate of the daughter's mental health. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong; she acted to protect her child.\n"
