We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author's husband and mother criticizing the daughter in front of her, which led to the daughter being upset. The author then told her mother and husband to \"fuck off\" because they weren't being respectful.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The daughter is 26, dealing with depression, and has made significant progress. The husband is venting about her messiness, and the mother is agreeing. They're being critical in front of her, which causes emotional distress. The daughter's mental health is a key point here.\n\nThe author's main concern is protecting her daughter's mental health. She intervenes when the daughter is being criticized, which leads to her outburst. The question is whether her reaction is justified. \n\nIn terms of social norms, yelling and using strong language like \"fuck off\" can be seen as rude or overly harsh. However, the context is important. The daughter was already in a vulnerable state, and the parents' comments might have triggered a setback in her recovery. \n\nThe author's intent was to defend her daughter from public humiliation and protect her mental health. The husband not apologizing adds to the stress. The author's actions were a response to protect her child, which is a valid parental concern. \n\nBut was there a better way to handle it? Maybe. However, when emotions are high, people might not act in the most rational way. The key points are the daughter's well-being versus the parents' right to express their opinions. The author might feel that the criticism was not constructive and was harmful. \n\nConsidering that the daughter was crying and self-deprecating, the author's intervention was in response to a stressful situation. While the method was harsh, the underlying motivation was protective. The husband and mother might see the outburst as disrespectful, but the author's primary goal was to defend her daughter. \n\nSo, weighing the intent against the action, the author's decision was made to shield her daughter from further harm. In that case, maybe she isn't in the wrong. But some might argue that the way she handled it was inappropriate. However, given the context of the daughter's mental health, the answer might lean towards her being justified.\n"
