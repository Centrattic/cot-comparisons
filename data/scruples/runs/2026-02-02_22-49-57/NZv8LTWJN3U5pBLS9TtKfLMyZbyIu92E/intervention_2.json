We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong (AITA) for yelling at their mother and husband after they criticized their daughter in front of her.\n\nFirst, the context: The daughter has been through a tough time with depression and has been making progress. She's now in a good place, working, in school, and seeing a therapist. The parents are concerned about her messiness, which is a recent issue linked to her past depression. The mother and husband confront her about it in front of her, which upsets her. The daughter starts crying and feeling like a \"piece of shit.\" The author, who's the daughter's parent, intervenes by yelling at the other two to stop or leave. They didn't apologize, and now there's a rift.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for their outburst. \n\nOn one hand, the author's actions were to protect their daughter from emotional harm. The daughter's mental health is a priority, and public criticism could set her back. The author's reaction, while harsh, was in defense of their child. The mother and husband weren't supportive here, and the author felt it was necessary to intervene to prevent further harm.\n\nOn the other hand, yelling and using strong language like \"fuck off\" might be seen as inappropriate, even if the intent was good. However, the trigger was the daughter's emotional breakdown, which adds context. The author's actions were a direct response to protect their child from further humiliation. \n\nThe key factors are the daughter's vulnerable state, the public criticism from family members, and the immediate emotional impact. The author's outburst was a reaction to protect their child, which is often seen as a justifiable, if extreme, action. The mother and husband's behavior seems to be the root issue here, especially since the husband didn't apologize. \n\nSo, considering the context and the emotional stakes, the answer is likely B: No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
