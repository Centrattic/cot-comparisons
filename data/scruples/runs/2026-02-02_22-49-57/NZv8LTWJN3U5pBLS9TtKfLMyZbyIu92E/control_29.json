We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for yelling at her mother and husband. Let me read the situation again.\n\nSo, the daughter moved back in after a tough breakup and depression. She's making progress with a job, school, therapy. The husband is annoyed by her messiness, which the author finds understandable given her daughter's workload. The mother visits, and they talk about the daughter's messiness in front of her. The husband doesn't apologize when the daughter is upset, and the mother continues the criticism. The author then yells at both to be respectful or \"fuck off,\" takes her daughter to get food, and now the family is upset. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter is struggling with mental health improvements. Public criticism from parents, especially when the daughter is vulnerable, could be harmful. The husband and mother's actions seem to undermine the daughter's progress. The author intervened to protect her, which was a split-second reaction.\n\nIs yelling acceptable? Well, the daughter was crying and internalizing the criticism as \"a piece of shit.\" The author's intervention was to stop the emotional harm. While the language used might be harsh, the intent was protective. The alternative might have been letting the daughter's mental health regress due to family criticism.\n\nHowever, the author's method of confrontation using strong language could be seen as over the top. But the situation is stressful and urgent. The husband and mother's behavior might be more at fault for not considering the daughter's feelings. The author's action was a reaction to protect her daughter, which is a valid concern.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's action, though harsh, was a response to protect her daughter's mental health. The husband and mother's actions were inconsiderate. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but maybe could have handled it differently. The answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
