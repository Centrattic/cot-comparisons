We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the daughter is doing well after a tough breakup and depression, but she's still a bit messy. The husband and mother criticize her in front of her, leading to the daughter feeling terrible. The author, the mother of the daughter, snaps and tells them to fuck off.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter is in a sensitive state, working on her recovery. Public criticism from family members can be really damaging, especially if someone has a history of depression. The husband didn't apologize when the daughter was upset, which is a problem. The mother and husband continued to berate her, which escalated the situation.\n\nThe author's reaction was to stand up for her daughter, which is understandable. Yelling and using harsh language might not be the best approach, but the underlying reason is about protecting a vulnerable family member from hurtful comments. The key here is whether the author's response was proportionate. She intervened when her daughter was being criticized, which could prevent further harm. However, the method of confrontation was aggressive.\n\nOn one hand, using \"fuck off\" is strong language and might be seen as disrespectful. On the other hand, the intent was to stop the hurtful comments and support her daughter. The author's actions were in defense of her daughter's mental health, which is a valid concern. The husband and mother's actions initiated the problem by berating the daughter in front of her. \n\nSo, considering that the author's outburst was a reaction to protect her daughter from emotional harm caused by others, maybe she's not in the wrong. However, some might argue that she shouldn't have used such language. But given the context of defending a vulnerable person, it's a tough call. The main issue is the initial criticism from the husband and mother, so the author's response was a reaction to that. Therefore, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the motivation was to protect her daughter from further harm.\n"
