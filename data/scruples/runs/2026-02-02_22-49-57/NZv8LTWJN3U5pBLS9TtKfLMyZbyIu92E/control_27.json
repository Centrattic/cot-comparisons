We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is at fault. The scenario involves a daughter with depression who's been making progress, but her father and mother-in-law are criticizing her for being messy and not taking care of her cat in front of her. The mother-in-law and husband are both berating her, leading the author to snap and tell them to fuck off or go have dinner alone.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. The daughter has been through a lot, has a new job, school, and therapy, so she's under a lot of stress. Her messiness is part of her ongoing struggle, and the parents are criticizing her in a public way, which is hurtful. The author's daughter was already feeling bad about herself after the interaction, leading her to say she's a \"piece of shit.\" \n\nThe author, who's presumably the mother, stepped in to defend her daughter. She lost her temper, which is understandable given the situation. The key points here are the public humiliation of the daughter by her father and mother-in-law, the daughter's mental health history, and the author's reaction to protect her child. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the criticism from husband and mother was unkind and inconsiderate, especially in front of the daughter, then the author's reaction might be justified. However, using strong language like \"fuck off\" could be seen as inappropriate, but the context is a heated emotional situation. \n\nThe daughter's mental health is a significant factor. The parents' comments could set her recovery back. The author's primary concern is her daughter's well-being, so her reaction is in defense of that. Even though she used harsh language, the intent was to stop the harmful behavior towards her child. \n\nIn terms of social norms, while the language used is extreme, the author's motivation is protective. The husband not apologizing after the daughter was upset is also a problem. The mother-in-law and husband's actions contributed to the daughter's distress, so the author's outburst might be seen as a necessary reaction to defend her child. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The criticism from spouse and mother-in-law was hurtful and inconsiderate, and the author acted to protect her daughter. The answer would likely be B (No).\n"
