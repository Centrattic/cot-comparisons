We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their mother and husband to fuck off after they criticized their daughter. The daughter is dealing with depression and had gotten out of a bad relationship. She's working, going to school, and in therapy, so she's making progress. The parents are upset about her being messy, which the author is more lenient towards because they know how much the daughter is handling.\n\nThe key points here are the daughter's mental health, the parents' public criticism, and the author's response. The husband didn't apologize, and the mother kept berating her even when she was upset. The author stepped in to protect their daughter, which is a common parent instinct. They were angry because the criticism could harm the daughter's recovery. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author was wrong. The husband and mother were being unkind in front of the daughter, which is hurtful. The author intervened to stop them, using strong language. While the language was harsh, the intent was to protect their child's feelings and mental health. The daughter was crying and feeling like a \"piece of shit,\" so the immediate action was to prevent further damage. \n\nThe author hasn't reached out to the mother or husband since, but they did take the daughter to calm down. It's possible they felt justified in their actions because they were prioritizing their daughter's well-being. However, using such language might have been a poor choice, even if the motivation was good. But considering the context\u2014mental health and public shaming\u2014it's a tough spot. So, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because protecting a vulnerable child from harsh criticism is valid, even if the method was extreme.\n"
