We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for yelling at their mother and husband. The situation involves the daughter, who was recovering from depression, being criticized in front of her by both the husband and mother. The author stepped in to defend her daughter, which led to a fallout with family members.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter was struggling with depression but has made significant progress. The husband and mother were publicly criticizing her messiness and the cat's care in her presence, which upset her. The daughter's emotional response\u2014crying and feeling like a \"piece of shit\"\u2014is a red flag. The author intervened to protect her daughter's mental health, which is a valid concern.\n\nThe key points here are the public criticism, the emotional impact on the daughter, and the author's reaction to defend her. While the husband and mother might have thought they were just offering their opinions, doing so in front of the daughter and making her feel bad could set back her recovery. The author's outburst was a reaction to protect their child, which is a natural instinct. However, yelling and using harsh language could be seen as excessive, but the underlying motivation is protective.\n\nThe question is whether the author's actions were wrong. Considering the daughter's mental health history and the public shaming, the author's intervention was in the daughter's best interest. The husband didn't apologize, and the mother continued the criticism, which might have escalated the situation. The author's anger stems from a desire to shield their daughter, which is understandable. So, the answer is likely B, not in the wrong.\n"
