We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation involves a family conflict where the author's mother and husband criticized their daughter in front of her, leading to the daughter feeling awful. The author then lost their temper and told her mother and husband to \"fuck off.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter has a history of depression and has made significant progress. The mother and husband criticized her about being messy and taking care of the cat, which was done in front of her. The daughter was already emotional and crying, and the parents didn't apologize. The author intervened to protect their daughter's feelings, leading to a confrontation.\n\nFrom a psychological perspective, when someone close to you is vulnerable (like a daughter recovering from depression), public criticism from family members can be very damaging. The author's reaction might be seen as a protective measure, especially since they've cut the daughter some slack due to her heavy workload and ongoing therapy. The key points here are the daughter's mental health, the public shaming by the husband and mother, and the author's emotional response to defend their child.\n\nHowever, the author did use harsh language (\"fuck off\"), which is aggressive and might be seen as inappropriate, even in a moment of anger. But the intent was to protect their daughter from further harm. The question is whether the means justified the ends. \n\nIn many cases, people might empathize with the author because they stepped in to defend their child from unjust or cruel criticism. The daughter's well-being is a priority, especially given her history. The mother and husband's actions could be seen as insensitive, and the author's outburst was a direct result of witnessing their daughter being emotionally attacked without any remorse from the others.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author should have handled the situation more calmly, even if upset. But considering the emotional state of the daughter and the potential long-term impact on her mental health, the author's intervention could be justified as a necessary action to prevent further harm.\n\nSo, the author's right to be angry stems from the context of protecting a vulnerable family member. The use of strong language might not excuse the outburst entirely, but the underlying motivation is protective and concerned. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
