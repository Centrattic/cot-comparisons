We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe user is a parent whose daughter is 26 and has been coming back from a tough breakup, moving in with them, and has been dealing with depression. The daughter has made a lot of progress\u2014getting a job, going to school, therapy. The husband and mother are criticizing the daughter's messiness and her cat in front of her, which upsets her. The daughter is crying and feeling bad about herself. The mother and husband don't apologize, so the parent (the author) loses it and tells them both to fuck off and leaves with the daughter. Now, the author is worried if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, let's consider the context. The daughter has been through a lot and is making progress. The parents are trying to support her, but the husband and mother are being critical in a public way, which causes emotional harm. The author steps in to protect their daughter, which seems like a protective action. However, the method was confrontational and used strong language.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author was wrong. The key factors here are intent and proportionality. The author's intent was to defend their daughter's mental health, which is a valid concern. The daughter was already vulnerable, and the criticism from family members could set her back. The author's reaction was a response to seeing their daughter in emotional distress. However, the manner of the response\u2014yelling and using a strong curse phrase\u2014might be seen as inappropriate, even if the intent was good.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband and mother were in the wrong for criticizing the daughter in front of her, especially considering her history with depression. The author's action could be seen as a necessary boundary to protect the daughter's well-being. However, using such strong language might have escalated the conflict and could be seen as disrespectful towards the mother and husband, even if they were wrong.\n\nIn many cases, the appropriateness of a reaction depends on the context. If someone is being abusive or harmful, standing up for a vulnerable family member is justified. However, the method of confrontation can affect how the situation is perceived. The author's outburst, while understandable, might not be the best approach in terms of conflict resolution. But given the emotional state of the daughter and the need to protect her, the author's action could be seen as a justified response to protect their child's mental health.\n\nAnother angle is that the author took responsibility for calming the daughter and removing her from the situation, which is a positive outcome. The husband and mother's behavior was inappropriate, and the author might be in the right for stopping their harmful criticism. However, the use of such strong language could be problematic in terms of family relationships, even if it was in defense of the daughter.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's intent was protective and well-meaning. The action, while perhaps not the best way to handle it, was in response to a stressful and emotionally charged situation. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
