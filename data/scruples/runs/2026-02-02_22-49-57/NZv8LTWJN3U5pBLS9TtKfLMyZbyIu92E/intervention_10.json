We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for yelling at her mother and husband after they criticized her daughter in front of her. The situation is pretty detailed.\n\nFirst, the daughter has a history of depression and has been making progress. The husband and mother are pointing out her messiness and not taking care of the cat, which is in front of her. The daughter is upset, and the author steps in. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but they want another opinion.\n\nSo, what's the key here? The daughter is in a vulnerable state. The parents and mother-in-law are publicly criticizing her, which could trigger a setback in her mental health. The author intervened to protect her daughter, which shows they care about her well-being. \n\nBut wait, was there a better way to handle it? Maybe, but the situation is emotional. The husband didn't apologize, and the mother continued. The author's outburst was a reaction to protect their daughter from further harm. In terms of right or wrong, it's about the intent and the circumstances. The author's main concern was their daughter's mental health, so their action, while harsh, was in defense. \n\nHowever, yelling at both mother and husband might have been a poor choice. But considering the daughter was crying and in a fragile state, the author's reaction might be justified. The question is whether the ends justify the means here. The author prioritized their daughter's emotional safety over handling the situation calmly. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the husband and mother started the problem by berating the daughter in front of her. The author's response was a direct reaction to that. So, maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they were protecting their child from emotional harm. The answer would likely be B, No.\n"
