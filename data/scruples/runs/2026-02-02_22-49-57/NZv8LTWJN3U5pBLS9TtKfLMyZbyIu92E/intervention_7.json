We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for telling her mother and husband to \"fuck off\" after they berated her daughter in front of her. \n\nFirst, the context: The daughter is 26, has been in a difficult period with depression, has made significant progress, and is now handling a job, school, and therapy. The husband and mother criticized her for being messy and not taking proper care of her cat, which upset her. The daughter was crying and internalizing the criticism as \"being a piece of shit.\" The author stepped in to defend her daughter, leading to the outburst.\n\nThe key points to consider are the emotional state of the daughter, the public nature of the criticism, and the author's protective response. The daughter was in a vulnerable position, especially given her history of depression. The husband and mother's comments might have been insensitive, even if they were pointing out the messiness. Criticizing someone's habits in front of them and others can be damaging, especially when they're already struggling.\n\nThe author's reaction was a direct consequence of defending her daughter from what she perceived as harmful criticism. While yelling and using strong language isn't ideal, the intent was to protect her daughter's mental health. The question of who is in the wrong often hinges on intentions and the context of the actions. Here, the author's intention was protective, which is a strong mitigating factor. The husband and mother's actions might have been unkind and dismissive of the daughter's current challenges.\n\nHowever, the author's method of confrontation could have been more constructive. Instead of using harsh language, perhaps addressing the issue calmly after the situation cooled down might have been better. But given the immediate emotional impact on the daughter, the author's reaction is understandable as a defense mechanism. \n\nIn many AITA scenarios, the line between right and wrong depends on the intent and the context. Since the daughter's mental health is a priority, the author's actions were driven by a desire to protect her. The husband and mother's failure to apologize and the ongoing silence after the incident also suggest that their actions contributed significantly to the conflict.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author's outburst was a reaction to the perceived harm being done to her daughter. While the language used was harsh, the underlying motivation was protective. Therefore, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
