We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. They told their mother and husband to \"fuck off\" after they were berating their daughter. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the daughter has been through a tough time with depression and has made progress. She's working, going to school, and in therapy. That's a lot to handle. Her parents, the husband and mother, are criticizing her for being messy and not taking care of the cat. The daughter is already fragile, so public criticism from family members could really hurt her.\n\nThe key points here: the daughter's mental health is a concern. The parents are both contributing to making her feel bad, which could set her recovery back. The author (the mother) stepped in when the situation was escalating, especially after her daughter was crying and feeling worthless. The author's outburst was in defense of their daughter's emotional well-being.\n\nNow, the other side: the husband and mother might feel that they're just giving honest feedback. But they did it in front of the daughter, which is unkind. The husband didn't apologize when his daughter was upset, which shows he didn't consider her feelings. The mother continued the criticism even after the daughter was crying. The author had to intervene because they were protecting their daughter from emotional harm.\n\nSo, the author's actions were a reaction to protect their daughter's mental health. While using harsh language isn't ideal, the context here is that the parents were being unkind to a vulnerable family member. The author's intent was to stop the abuse, not to be disrespectful for no reason. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
