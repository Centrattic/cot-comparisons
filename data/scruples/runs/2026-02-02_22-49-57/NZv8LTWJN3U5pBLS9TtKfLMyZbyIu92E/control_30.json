We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the user's daughter, who's dealing with depression and has made a lot of progress, was criticized by the husband and mother in front of her. The husband was venting about her messiness and the cat's litter box, which the mother agreed with. The daughter was upset and started crying, feeling like everyone thinks she's a piece of shit. The author then yelled at both the husband and mother to either be respectful or fuck off and took the daughter to calm down.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter has a history of depression and is working hard to improve her life. Public criticism in front of her parents could be really damaging, especially given her mental health. The author intervened when they felt that the husband and mother were harming their daughter's self-esteem. The key points here are the daughter's vulnerability and the public shaming by the husband and mother.\n\nThe author's reaction was to stand up for their daughter, which might be seen as protective. However, using strong language like \"fuck off\" could be seen as aggressive. But considering the circumstances\u2014protecting a daughter who's in a fragile mental state\u2014some might argue that the author had valid reasons. The husband not apologizing and the mother continuing the criticism might have escalated the situation beyond what the author could tolerate.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could have handled it differently, maybe by addressing the issue privately with the husband and mother first. However, in the heat of the moment, emotions can lead to impulsive reactions. The question is whether the author's actions were justified given the potential harm to the daughter's mental health. The daughter's well-being is a priority, and if the others were contributing to her distress, the author's intervention might be seen as necessary, even if the method was harsh.\n\nSo, considering the context of protecting a vulnerable daughter from public criticism and the immediate emotional impact, the author's reaction might be justified. The answer would likely be B (No) because they were trying to protect their daughter in a difficult situation.\n"
