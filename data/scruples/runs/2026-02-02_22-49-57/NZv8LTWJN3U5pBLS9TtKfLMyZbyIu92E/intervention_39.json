We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author lashing out at their mother and husband after they criticized their daughter in front of her. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The daughter, who's 26, has a history of depression but is now doing well with a job, school, and therapy. The husband and mother are criticizing her for being messy, specifically about the cat's litter box, in front of her. This leads to the daughter being upset, saying she's a \"piece of shit,\" and the author steps in by telling her parents and husband to \"fuck off.\"\n\nSo, the key points here are: the daughter is under professional care, the parents and husband are publicly criticizing her, which causes emotional harm, and the author intervenes to protect her. \n\nI should consider if the author's reaction was justified. The husband and mother were directly contributing to the daughter's emotional distress. The author's outburst was in response to them belittling the daughter, which could be seen as defending her. However, the author's language (\"fuck off\") is harsh, which might make others think they're in the wrong. But the context is important\u2014they were defending their daughter from public humiliation.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have handled it differently, like talking to them privately first. But given the immediate emotional impact on the daughter, the author felt it necessary to act quickly. The daughter's mental health is a priority here. The husband not apologizing after the daughter said he hurt her feelings might indicate he wasn't considering her feelings, which adds to the tension.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often judge based on intent and context. The author's intent was to protect their daughter, which is a valid concern. The public criticism by the husband and mother could be seen as the real issue. The author's reaction, while strong, was a response to protect their child's mental health. So, the author isn't the asshole here; the husband and mother might be more at fault for their behavior towards the daughter.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
