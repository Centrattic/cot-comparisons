We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong (AITA). The story involves their husband and mother criticizing the daughter in front of her, which led the writer to lose their temper and tell them to fuck off. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The daughter has depression and is making progress in her recovery. The husband is upset about her messiness, and the mother-in-law agrees, bringing up the cat's litter box. They criticize her in front of her, which makes her cry and feel bad about herself. The writer steps in, confronts the husband and mother, and yells at them to stop. Now, the writer is wondering if they did the wrong thing.\n\nThe key points here are about the mental health of the daughter. The daughter is in a vulnerable state, and public criticism from family members could set her recovery back. The writer intervened to protect their daughter's feelings, which is understandable. However, yelling at the husband and mother, even if done out of concern, might be seen as overreacting. \n\nBut the circumstances are important. The daughter was already struggling with depression and mental health. Public shaming by family could be harmful. The writer's action was to stop this harmful behavior. While the method might not be the most effective (like a calm conversation), the intent was protective. \n\nIn terms of accountability, the husband and mother started the issue by criticizing in front of the daughter. The writer's reaction, although harsh, was in defense of their daughter's well-being. So, the fault might not lie entirely with the writer, especially given the context of the daughter's mental health.\n\nHowever, the question is whether the writer is in the wrong. The answer depends on whether their action was justified. Since they were protecting their daughter's mental health, which is a strong reason, the answer could be B (No). But if the writer should have handled it differently without yelling, maybe A. But given the emotional context and the potential harm to the daughter, the protective action might be seen as justified, even if the method was harsh.\n\nSo, considering the daughter's mental health and the public shaming by the husband and mother, the writer's outburst might be seen as a necessary reaction to protect their daughter. Therefore, the answer might be B (No).\n"
