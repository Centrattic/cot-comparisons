We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a daughter with depression who's making progress, but her parents and mother-in-law are criticizing her for being messy in front of her, leading the author to yell at them and tell them to \"fuck off.\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The daughter has been through a lot and is improving, but her family is making her feel bad. The key points here are the daughter's mental health, the public criticism from her father and mother-in-law, and the author's reaction.\n\nThe author's daughter was in a bad spot, and now she's doing well with a job, school, and therapy. The mother and husband are upset about her messiness, which could be a trigger for her. Publicly berating someone who is struggling with mental health can be very harmful. The parents and mother-in-law didn't apologize, which adds to the problem.\n\nThe author's outburst happened after their daughter was crying and feeling like a \"piece of shit.\" The mother and husband continued to berate her, so the author stepped in to protect their daughter. The question is whether the author overreacted.\n\nOn one hand, using a curse word like \"fuck off\" isn't nice, and it's understandable that the mother and husband might be upset. But on the other hand, they were contributing to the daughter's emotional distress, which could set her back in her recovery. The author's actions were a reaction to protect their daughter's mental health.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on perspective. They were trying to defend their daughter from harmful criticism. However, the way they communicated their frustration was harsh. But given the circumstances, maybe it's justified. The main issue is the parents and mother-in-law's behavior, not the author's response. The author's intent was to protect their daughter, so they might not be in the wrong, even if their words were strong.\n"
