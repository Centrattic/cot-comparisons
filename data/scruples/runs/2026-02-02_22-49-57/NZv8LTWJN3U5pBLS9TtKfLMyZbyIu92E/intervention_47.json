We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, their husband, and mother criticizing their daughter in front of her, leading the author to lose their temper and tell them to fuck off.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The daughter has clinical depression and has made significant progress: new job, back in school, therapy. The husband and mother are upset about her messiness, which the author attributes to her depression. The problem is that they discussed this in front of her, which was hurtful. The daughter's emotional response was crying and saying she's a piece of shit. The author intervened, told them to be respectful or leave, and took the daughter out to calm down.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to decide between A and B. Let's break it down. The husband and mother are being critical of the daughter in her presence, which is unkind, especially given her mental health struggles. The author's reaction was to protect their daughter from further emotional harm. The daughter's progress is important, and being berated by family could derail it. \n\nIs the author wrong for standing up for their child? They used harsh language, but the context is a vulnerable daughter. The husband didn't apologize when the daughter said he hurt her feelings, which shows he wasn't considerate. The mother joined in the criticism. The author's action, while strong, was in defense of their child. In many cases, parents might prioritize protecting their child's mental health over being polite. \n\nHowever, using profanity might be seen as inappropriate. But given the circumstances\u2014daughter's mental state, public criticism, and the family not apologizing\u2014it could be a justified response. The author hasn't reached out since, but the main question is whether they're in the wrong. Considering the daughter's well-being, the author's actions seem protective. The husband and mother were inconsiderate. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
