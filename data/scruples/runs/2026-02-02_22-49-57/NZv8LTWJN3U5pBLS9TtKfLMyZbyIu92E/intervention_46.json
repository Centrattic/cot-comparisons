We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves a daughter who's recovering from depression, and the mother and husband criticizing her messiness in front of her, leading to the daughter feeling terrible. The author then lost her temper and told them to fuck off. The user thinks the author isn't wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter is making progress in her recovery, which is important. The husband and mother's comments were in front of her, which is a big no-no. Public criticism can be really harmful, especially for someone dealing with mental health issues. The author stepped in to protect her daughter, which is a natural response to defend a child's feelings.\n\nNow, the author's response was to yell and tell them to fuck off. That's a strong reaction, but given the emotional state of the daughter and the fact that the others didn't apologize, maybe it's understandable. The key points are the intention behind the author's action and the impact of the parents' behavior. \n\nThe daughter was already vulnerable, and the parents' public criticism could have set her recovery back. The author's main goal was to protect her child's mental health. While the language used was harsh, the motivation was to stop the harm. \n\nIn terms of social norms, while losing your temper isn't ideal, the situation might justify it. The question is whether the author was in the wrong for speaking out. Since the parents initiated the harmful comments, the author's response is a defense mechanism. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B, the author is not in the wrong. They acted to protect their daughter from further emotional harm, even if the method was aggressive. The parents' initial behavior was problematic, so the author's reaction is a justified defense.\n"
