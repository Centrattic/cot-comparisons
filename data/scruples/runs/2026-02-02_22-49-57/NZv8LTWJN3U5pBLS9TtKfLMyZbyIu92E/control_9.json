We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong for yelling at their mother and husband after they criticized their daughter in front of her.\n\nFirst, the daughter is dealing with depression and has made significant progress. The husband and mother criticized her for being messy and not taking care of her cat, which was done in front of her. The daughter was upset, feeling bad about herself. The author, who is the mother, intervened to protect her daughter's feelings by yelling at her mother and husband.\n\nSo, the key points here are the mental health of the daughter, the public criticism from family members, and the mother's reaction to defend her child. The husband and mother were being unkind, but the mother's response was to tell them to shut up or leave. \n\nNow, considering the context, the daughter is vulnerable. The mother probably felt that her daughter's mental health could regress if she kept being criticized. The mother's action was a reaction to protect her child. However, using harsh language like \"fuck off\" is strong, but given the circumstances, it might be seen as a justified outburst. \n\nOn the other hand, the mother and husband could have handled the criticism privately instead of in front of the daughter. The husband not apologizing when the daughter was hurt is also a problem. The mother's response might be seen as necessary to stop further harm. \n\nSo, while the method was extreme, the intent was to protect her daughter. Therefore, the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong), as the mother's actions were in defense of her child's well-being, even if the approach was harsh.\n"
