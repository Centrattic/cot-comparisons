We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves their mother and husband criticizing the daughter in front of her, leading to an emotional outburst.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key elements. The daughter has been working hard to recover from depression, and her parents and husband are pointing out her slobbishness. The mother and husband do this in front of her, which is really hurtful. The daughter is already under a lot of stress with school, job, and therapy. The daughter's self-worth is clearly affected when she says she's a piece of shit. The author steps in to defend her, telling the mother and husband to back off, which caused a rift in the family.\n\nNow, considering the context: The daughter is struggling but making progress. Public criticism from family members can be damaging, especially with mental health issues. The author's role is to support the daughter, so stepping in to protect her emotional well-being seems justified. The mother and husband weren't just making a casual comment; they were berating her in front of others, which could set back her mental health. The author's response, while harsh, was a reaction to protect their daughter. The fact that the mother and husband didn't apologize suggests they might have overstepped. The author feels bad but is right to prioritize their daughter's well-being.\n\nHowever, the author used strong language (\"fuck off\"), which might be seen as inappropriate. But given the emotional context and the daughter's fragile state, it's a defense mechanism. The mother and husband's actions were the initial wrongdoing. So, the author isn't in the wrong for defending their daughter. The key here is the context of the daughter's mental health and the public shaming by family members. The author's actions were a necessary intervention to prevent further harm. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
