We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the scenario again carefully.\n\nThe author is a parent, married, with a daughter who's 26. The daughter moved in after a tough breakup and has been dealing with depression. She's improved a lot\u2014got a job, going to school, therapy. But she's a bit messy now, which the husband is upset about. The author gives her the benefit of the doubt because she's handling a lot. \n\nThen the mother visits, and the husband and mother start criticizing the daughter in front of her about the messiness and the cat's litter box. The daughter gets emotional, calls herself a piece of shit. The author takes her to get food and calm down, and tells the husband and mother to be respectful or to fuck off. Now they're not talking to each other, and the author is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here: the daughter is doing well after battling depression. Public criticism from family members could trigger a setback. The author felt the need to defend their daughter's mental health, leading to an outburst. \n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. On one hand, yelling and using strong language like \"fuck off\" is confrontational. But on the other hand, they were protecting their daughter from harmful criticism that might negatively impact her mental health. The husband and mother were being disrespectful in front of the daughter, which is a problem. The author's reaction was to set a boundary, which might be seen as justified given the circumstances. \n\nThe daughter's mental state is fragile, and the parents' actions could have been damaging. The author's outburst was a response to protect the daughter, so maybe it's understandable. However, the method of communication was harsh. But considering the context, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. The alternative is that the mother and husband were in the wrong for criticizing the daughter in front of her. The author took a stand, even if the manner was aggressive. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author was defending their daughter's well-being. It's a tough situation, but the motivation was to protect her mental health, which is crucial. The husband and mother's behavior was the initial problem.\n"
