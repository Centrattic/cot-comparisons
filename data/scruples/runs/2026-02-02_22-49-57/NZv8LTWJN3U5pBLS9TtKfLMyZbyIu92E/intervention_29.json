We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author yelling at their mother and husband after they criticized their daughter in front of her, which upset the daughter. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the daughter has a history of depression but is now doing better. The mom and husband publicly criticized her messiness and her cat, which caused her to cry and feel bad about herself. The author intervened, told them to stop or leave, and hasn't spoken to them since. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong.\n\nSo, is the author at fault? Well, the key points are the public shaming of the daughter, which could harm her mental health, and the author's reaction. The daughter was in a vulnerable spot, and the parents and husband didn't support her. The author's outburst was in defense of her daughter, which is understandable. But did she overreact?\n\nArguments for the author being wrong (A): Maybe the author shouldn't have yelled, even if the others were wrong. Perhaps she could have handled it more calmly to resolve the situation without cutting off communication.\n\nArguments for the author not being wrong (B): The daughter was being bullied in front of her, which is a serious issue. The author stepped in to protect her mental health, which is crucial. The husband and mother were in the wrong by not being supportive, so the author's reaction was justified.\n\nConsidering the daughter's mental health history, the public criticism was harmful. The author's action was a direct response to protect her child. The husband and mother's behavior was the root issue here. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
