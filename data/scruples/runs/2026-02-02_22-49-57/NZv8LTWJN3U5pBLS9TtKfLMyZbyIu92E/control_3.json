We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is at fault. The scenario involves a daughter recovering from depression, and her parents and mother-in-law criticizing her for being messy in front of her. The author, the mother, snapped and told them to fuck off. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter has been through a lot and is making progress. The husband and mother are being critical, which is causing her emotional distress. The daughter is already vulnerable, and public criticism might trigger a relapse. The author's reaction was to protect her daughter, which could be seen as a justified response to defend her mental health.\n\nOn the other hand, using a swear word like \"fuck off\" might be seen as aggressive. However, the situation's severity\u2014daughter sobbing, feeling like a piece of shit\u2014suggests that the criticism was harmful. The author's actions were in response to immediate harm to their child. The husband and mother not apologizing even after causing the daughter to cry could mean they weren't considering her feelings, so the author's outburst might be a necessary intervention.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? The key points are whether the reaction was proportionate. The daughter's emotional state is critical here. The author might feel that the criticism was undermining her daughter's recovery. Even though the language was harsh, the intent was protective. In such cases, people might argue that the author was defending their child against harmful behavior, making them not in the wrong. Alternatively, others might say they should have handled it more calmly. However, given the daughter's mental health, the immediate action was to stop the harm, which could be seen as the right decision. So the answer might be B (No).\n"
