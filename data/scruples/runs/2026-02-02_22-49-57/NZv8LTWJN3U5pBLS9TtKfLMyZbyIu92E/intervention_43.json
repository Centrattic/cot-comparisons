We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves their daughter who's been through a lot and is working on her recovery. The parents, the husband and mother, criticized the daughter in front of her, which led to her emotional breakdown. The author snapped and told them to \"fuck off\" or leave her alone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter has depression and was in a bad place before moving in. Now she's doing well, getting a job, going to school, and therapy. The husband and mother criticized her for being messy and not taking care of the cat, which the daughter is already struggling with. That's a lot to handle.\n\nThe key points here are the public criticism of someone who's vulnerable. Public shaming, especially from family, can be really damaging. The daughter was already crying and feeling like a \"piece of shit.\" The parents didn't apologize, so the author stepped in to defend her. The author's reaction, while strong, was in response to the parents' hurtful comments that could undermine the daughter's progress.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, using harsh language was definitely intense, but the situation might have escalated due to the parents' actions. The author's intent was protective. The parents might be seen as the ones who started the problem by criticizing the daughter in a harmful way. The author's outburst was a reaction to protect their daughter's mental health. So, considering the context, the author might not be at fault here. But maybe there's a middle ground. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. The answer could be B (No) because they were defending their daughter from harmful criticism.\n"
