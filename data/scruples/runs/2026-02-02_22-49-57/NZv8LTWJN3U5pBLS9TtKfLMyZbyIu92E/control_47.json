We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a daughter who's recovering from depression and moving back in with her parents. The mom and husband are both supportive, which is good. But the daughter has some slob habits now, which the husband is annoyed by. Then the mother-in-law visits and the husband and mother start criticizing the daughter in front of her, specifically about her cat's litter box. The daughter gets really upset, starts crying, and says everyone thinks she's a piece of shit. The author then yells at her mother and husband to stop, telling them to fuck off, and takes the daughter to get food and calm down. Now they're not speaking.\n\nSo the question is, is the author at fault? Let's break it down. The daughter is in a vulnerable state, recovering from depression. Public shaming and criticism could trigger a relapse. The mother and husband, even if they meant well, were venting about her messiness in front of her. The daughter's reaction is severe, indicating that the comments were harsh and hurtful. The author stepped in to protect her daughter, which is a natural response to prevent further harm.\n\nBut was yelling and using profanity the right approach? The author has never spoken to them like that before. They might feel justified because they saw the daughter's emotional state deteriorating. The key point is whether the criticism from the in-laws was constructive or just hurtful. Since the daughter is already struggling with a lot\u2014job, school, therapy\u2014their comments about the cat's litter box might be trivial and not the right time to focus on.\n\nFrom a psychological standpoint, when someone is in recovery, it's crucial to maintain a supportive environment. Public criticism can undermine progress. The author's intervention was to stop the immediate harm. While the method was harsh, the intent was protective. The mother and husband not apologizing after the daughter was clearly upset might indicate they didn't realize the severity of their actions. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could have handled it differently, like privately talking to them about the situation. But the immediate need was to comfort the daughter and stop the negative comments. The use of strong language was a reaction to the emotional distress caused. \n\nSo considering all that, the author's actions, while harsh, were in defense of their daughter's mental health. The in-laws' actions were the initial problem. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong here.\n"
