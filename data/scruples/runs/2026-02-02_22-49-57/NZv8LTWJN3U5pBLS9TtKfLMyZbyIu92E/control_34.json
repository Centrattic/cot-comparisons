We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author yelling at their mother and husband in front of their daughter after they criticized the daughter for being messy and not taking care of her cat. The daughter was already dealing with depression and had made progress, but the criticism from the parents made her feel awful.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The daughter has been struggling with depression but has improved. The husband and mother criticized her in public, which led to the daughter breaking down. The author intervened by yelling and telling them to be respectful or leave. The author hasn't spoken to them since and is feeling conflicted.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The author's main concern is protecting the daughter's mental health. Public criticism from parents, especially when the child is vulnerable, can be harmful. The author stepped in to defend their daughter, which is a protective action. However, the method used was yelling and using a strong phrase like \"fuck off.\" \n\nIs yelling justified? Well, in a situation where someone's mental health is at stake, a strong reaction might be seen as a necessary defense. The author's intention was to stop the criticism, not to be disrespectful. On the other hand, using such language might be seen as inappropriate, even if the intent was good. But the context here is that the daughter was already emotionally fragile and the criticism was happening in front of her. The author's reaction could be seen as a last resort to protect their child.\n\nThe husband and mother might feel that they were just pointing out the daughter's messiness, but doing so in front of her and without sensitivity could be unkind. The author's intervention was a response to protect their daughter's feelings. The fact that the husband didn't apologize after the daughter was upset suggests that the initial criticism was unhelpful. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions were driven by a desire to protect their child's well-being. While the language used was harsh, the situation's context justifies it as a protective measure. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
