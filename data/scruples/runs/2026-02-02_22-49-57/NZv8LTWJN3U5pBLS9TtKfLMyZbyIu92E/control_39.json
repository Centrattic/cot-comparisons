We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's daughter is going through a tough time, recovering from depression, and has a lot on her plate with school, a new job, and therapy. The daughter's messiness is a point of contention, especially with the husband and mother. The problem happened when the mother and husband criticized the daughter in front of her, which upset her and made her feel bad. The author then lost her temper and told them to \"fuck off\" in defense of her daughter.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The daughter is in a vulnerable state, trying to improve her mental health and life circumstances. Public criticism from family members could definitely set her back. The author intervened when they saw the daughter's emotional state, which seems like a protective response. However, the method of intervention was yelling and using strong language. \n\nThe key points here are the daughter's well-being versus the parents' behavior. The author's intention was likely to protect their daughter from further harm. But using such a strong reaction might come off as aggressive, even if it was justified. The question is whether the means of protecting the daughter were appropriate.\n\nOn one hand, the author's outburst was a reaction to what they perceived as a threat to their daughter's mental health. The husband and mother's comments were inconsiderate, especially given the daughter's situation. The author might feel that standing up for their daughter was necessary. \n\nOn the other hand, using harsh language can escalate tensions and might not be the best way to address the underlying issues. The author admits to feeling bad about losing their temper, which suggests they recognize the impropriety of the method, even if the intent was good. \n\nThe mother and husband's actions in berating the daughter in front of her and not apologizing are problematic. The author's response, while extreme, was a direct reaction to that. The question is whether the author's response was proportionate. Since the daughter was already in a fragile state, the immediate need was to comfort and protect her, and the author did that by removing her from the situation and confronting the others.\n\nBut the use of \"fuck off\" is a strong statement. In many social contexts, that's considered inappropriate, regardless of the reason. However, the context here is a family conflict where emotions are high. The author's primary goal was to protect their daughter, which is a valid concern. The other family members might not have realized the impact of their words, so the author's intervention, though harsh, was aimed at preventing further harm.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author's actions were driven by a desire to support their daughter, but the method used could be seen as aggressive. However, given the circumstances and the potential harm to the daughter's mental health, the author's response might be understandable. The key is whether the action was necessary to prevent greater harm. Since the daughter was already in a fragile state and the others were not backing down, the author's intervention could be seen as justified, even if the language was harsh.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's actions were a reaction to protect their daughter, which is a valid concern. The harsh language is a problem, but the underlying intent was protective. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong, as their primary responsibility was to their daughter's well-being. The other family members also have a part in the situation by their initial behavior. So the answer is B (No).\n"
