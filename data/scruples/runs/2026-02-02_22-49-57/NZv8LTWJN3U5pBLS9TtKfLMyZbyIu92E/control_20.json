We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the daughter has been through a tough time with depression and has made a lot of progress. The daughter is working and going to school, which is commendable. The husband and mother are criticizing her for being messy, especially about the cat's litter box. They do this in front of her, which is probably really hurtful. The daughter was already upset and started crying, feeling like everyone thinks she's a piece of shit. That's a serious emotional impact.\n\nThe author stepped in to console her daughter, which is understandable. Then when the mother and husband kept berating her, the author lost her temper and told them to fuck off. The key points here are the context and the intent. The author's motivation was to protect her daughter's mental health, which is a valid concern, especially given the daughter's history with depression. Public shaming in front of a vulnerable person can be damaging.\n\nBut was the author's reaction appropriate? Yelling and using strong language like \"fuck off\" might be seen as harsh, but considering the emotional state of the daughter and the fact that the criticism was happening in front of her, the author felt it was necessary to stop the negative behavior. The question is whether the means justified the ends. The author's primary goal was to defend her daughter, which is a protective instinct. The other two didn't apologize, so maybe they were being insensitive. The author hasn't reached out to reconcile yet, which might be part of the issue, but the initial reaction seems to be from a place of concern for her daughter's well-being.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the mother and husband's actions were definitely inconsiderate and potentially harmful. The author's response was a direct reaction to protect her daughter. While the language was strong, the intent was protective. So, the author isn't in the wrong for standing up for her daughter, even if the method was confrontational. The other parties have some responsibility here for their initial criticism. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
