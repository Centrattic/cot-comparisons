We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is wrong for telling her mother and husband to fuck off. The situation involves her daughter, who's recovering from depression, and her mother and husband criticizing her in front of her for being messy and not cleaning the cat's litter box.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter has been through a lot\u2014getting out of a bad relationship, dealing with depression, getting a job, going back to school, and seeing a therapist. She's making progress, which the mother-in-law and husband are aware of. However, they publicly criticize her messiness and the cat situation in front of her, which leads to her emotional breakdown. The author steps in, yells at them, and takes her daughter to comfort her. \n\nNow, the key points here are the intent and the impact. The author's main goal was to protect her daughter's mental health. Public criticism from family members, especially when someone is still recovering from depression, can be really harmful. The daughter's reaction (crying, feeling like a piece of shit) shows the negative impact of the criticism. The author's response was an emotional reaction to protect her daughter, which is understandable given the context.\n\nOn the other hand, using strong language like \"fuck off\" might be seen as harsh, but it's a direct consequence of the situation. The question is whether the author overstepped. Considering that the criticism was happening in front of the daughter and the daughter was already vulnerable, the author's intervention was to shield her from further harm. \n\nThe mother and husband's behavior also needs to be evaluated. They were discussing the daughter's shortcomings in a public setting, which isn't constructive. The husband didn't apologize when the daughter was upset, which doesn't help his cause. The mother continued the criticism even after the daughter was crying, which shows a lack of empathy. \n\nSo, the author's action was a reaction to protect her daughter's well-being. While the language used was strong, the underlying motivation was protective and justified. The other parties contributed to the problem by their public criticism. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B (No).\n"
