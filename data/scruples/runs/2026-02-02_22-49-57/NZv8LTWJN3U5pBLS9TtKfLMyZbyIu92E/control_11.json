We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario involves a daughter, her parents, and the author (the mother) reacting to her husband and mother being critical of their 26-year-old daughter in front of her.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key elements. The daughter is 26, has a history of depression, and is currently doing well with a job, school, and therapy. The husband and the mother are criticizing her for being messy and not taking care of a cat in front of her. The daughter is upset, and the author yells at them, telling them to be respectful or \"fuck off,\" then takes the daughter out to calm down. The author hasn't spoken to them since, and is now seeking if they're at fault.\n\nSo, the main issue is the public criticism by the husband and mother. The mother is defending her daughter, who is in a vulnerable state. The author's reaction is emotional, but is it justified?\n\nThe daughter's mental health history is crucial. If the husband and mother's comments were hurtful and could trigger a relapse, the author's intervention was protective. The husband not apologizing and the mother continuing the criticism might mean they weren't being supportive. The author's outburst, while harsh, could be seen as a reaction to protect her daughter's well-being. However, using profanity and cutting off communication might be seen as extreme.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's husband was venting about their daughter's habits, which might be a valid concern, but doing it in front of her and with the mother adds to the problem. The mother-in-law agreeing and adding to the criticism is another factor. The author's response could be a necessary stand to prevent emotional harm to the daughter, especially given her history with depression.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong for yelling? People might argue that while the intent was good, the method was inappropriate. However, considering the daughter's emotional state and the public shaming by the husband and mother, the author's reaction could be justified as a protective measure. The key is whether the criticism was constructive or hurtful, and if the author had a right to intervene to prevent harm.\n\nI think the author's actions were in response to protect her daughter's mental health, which is more important than the manner of the response. The husband and mother's behavior was the root issue, so the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer would be B (No).\n"
