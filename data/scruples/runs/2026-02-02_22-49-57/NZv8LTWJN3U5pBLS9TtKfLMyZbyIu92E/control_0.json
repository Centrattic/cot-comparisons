We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their mother and husband to fuck off after they criticized their daughter. The situation involves the daughter, who has depression and has been working hard on her recovery. The parents are upset about her messiness and the cat's litter box, and they talked about it in front of her. The author intervened when their daughter was emotionally upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The daughter is 26, has a job, is in school, and in therapy. The messiness might be a lingering effect of her depression, so it's a sensitive issue. The husband and mother were publicly berating her, which is hurtful. The daughter's reaction was emotional, and the husband didn't apologize, which likely made things worse. The author stepped in to protect their daughter, which is a common parental instinct when a child is being harmed emotionally.\n\nThe key points here are the mental health of the daughter and the parents' handling of criticism. Public shaming can be detrimental to someone with a history of depression. The author's outburst was a response to protect their daughter, not just an act of anger. While the language used was harsh, the intent was to stop the hurtful comments. The question is whether the method was wrong. \n\nIn many cases, people might say that while the intent was good, the method (curse words) was inappropriate. But others might argue that the emotional harm being done to the daughter justifies a strong reaction. The daughter's self-esteem is fragile, and the parents' continued criticism even after she was upset could be seen as crossing a line. The author's action was a direct response to defend their daughter, possibly in a moment of high emotion. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No), because the author was protecting their child from emotional harm. However, the use of profanity could be seen as a problem. But given the context of the daughter's mental health and the fact that the parents didn't stop after she was upset, the author's action was in defense. The parents might also share some responsibility for their public criticism.\n"
