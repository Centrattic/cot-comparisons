We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story did something wrong by yelling at her mother and husband in front of her daughter.\n\nFirst, the context: The daughter has been through a tough time with depression, has made significant progress, and is now balancing a job, school, and therapy. The husband is annoyed with her messiness, which is a change from before her depression. The mother-in-law agrees with him, and they confront the daughter in front of her, leading to her emotional breakdown. The author steps in, yells at them, and takes the daughter to calm down. Now the family is upset, and she's questioning if she was in the wrong.\n\nKey points to consider: The daughter's mental health is fragile. Publicly criticizing her when she's already struggling could trigger a relapse. The parents and husband didn't apologize, which added to the daughter's distress. The author's actions were a reaction to protect her daughter's well-being. While yelling might not be the ideal approach, the intent was to shield the daughter from further harm.\n\nPossible angles: Was the harsh language justified? Could there have been a better way to handle it? The daughter's emotional state is a major factor. The author's decision to prioritize her daughter's mental health might be seen as necessary, even if the method was abrupt.\n\nConsidering family dynamics, the mother and husband's behavior was hurtful. The author intervened when they refused to stop, which might be seen as necessary to prevent further damage. However, the use of strong language could be seen as crossing a line, but the intent was protective.\n\nIn conclusion, while the method could be debated, the motivation was to protect a vulnerable family member. The answer likely leans toward B (not in the wrong) because the action was driven by concern for the daughter's mental health, even if the approach was harsh.\n"
