We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong after yelling at her husband and mother for criticizing her daughter in front of her. \n\nFirst, the situation: The daughter has been through a lot, including depression and a recent breakup. She's making progress, which the author is proud of. The daughter moved in with her parents and is now handling school, a job, and therapy. But the husband is annoyed by her messiness, and the mother-in-law agrees. They confront her in front of the daughter, leading to emotional distress. The author steps in, tells them to stop or leave, and takes the daughter to calm down.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. The author is defending her daughter's mental health. The daughter was already vulnerable, and the parents' criticism could set her back. The husband didn't apologize even when the daughter was upset, which is concerning. The mother-in-law didn't support the daughter either. \n\nThe author's reaction was to protect her daughter. While yelling isn't ideal, it was a response to a harmful situation. The key points here are the daughter's well-being and the parents' lack of empathy. The author's actions were to shield her daughter from further harm, which seems justified given the context.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have handled it differently, like addressing the issue privately. But given the immediate emotional impact on the daughter, the author's priority was to stop the negativity. So, while the method might be harsh, the intent was protective. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
