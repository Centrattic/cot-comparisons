We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, their husband, mother, and daughter.\n\nFirst, the daughter has a history of depression and has made a lot of progress. The husband and mother criticized her in front of her, which upset her. The author then lost their temper and told them to fuck off. Now they're not speaking to the author, and the author is feeling conflicted.\n\nI need to consider the context. The daughter is in a vulnerable position, dealing with depression. Public criticism from family members could harm her mental health. The author intervened to protect her, which is understandable. But the method was aggressive\u2014using harsh language. However, given the emotional stakes and the daughter's well-being, maybe the author's reaction is justified.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband and mother might feel they had a right to express their concerns, but doing so in front of the daughter wasn't appropriate. The husband didn't apologize when the daughter was hurt, which is a problem. The mother continued the criticism after the daughter was upset. So the author stepped in when it was clear that the criticism was causing harm.\n\nIs the author wrong for getting angry? Maybe not, because they were defending their daughter. The key is whether the action was proportionate. The daughter was crying and feeling like a piece of shit. The author's outburst might have been a reaction to protect her dignity. In that case, the author isn't in the wrong. The other two might be at fault for their initial behavior.\n"
