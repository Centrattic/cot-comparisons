We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author yelling at their mother and husband after they criticized their daughter in front of her. The daughter has been dealing with depression and has made progress, but her messiness is a point of contention.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The daughter moved in after a tough breakup and has been working on her recovery. The husband and mother criticized her in front of her, which upset the daughter. The author intervened by telling them to stop or \"fuck off.\" The question is whether the author is at fault here.\n\nThe author's actions were a reaction to their daughter's emotional distress. They felt it was necessary to protect her from further harm, especially given her history with depression. The husband didn't apologize when the daughter expressed hurt feelings, and the mother continued the criticism. The author's outburst was in the moment, driven by concern for their daughter's well-being.\n\nNow, considering the options: A means the author is in the wrong, B means not. The key factors here are the daughter's mental health, the public shaming by the husband and mother, and the author's response. While yelling is not ideal, the intent was to protect their daughter. The husband and mother's actions might have been more problematic, as they were contributing to the daughter's distress. The author's reaction, though harsh, was in defense of their child. So the answer might lean towards B, but I need to check if there's a valid reason to say A. Maybe the author should have handled it differently, but the context of protecting a vulnerable daughter adds nuance. In AITA scenarios, intent and circumstances are important. The author's intent was protective, so B seems correct.\n"
