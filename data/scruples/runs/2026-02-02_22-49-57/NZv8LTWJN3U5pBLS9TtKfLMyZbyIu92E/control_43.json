We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a daughter recovering from depression, a husband and mother criticizing her in front of her, and the author (the mother) yelling at them.\n\nFirst, consider the context. The daughter is doing well after being in a bad situation, so any criticism now could be really damaging. The husband and mother are publicly berating her about her messiness and cat care, which is a sensitive topic. The daughter is emotional and feeling like a \"piece of shit,\" which shows the impact of their words.\n\nThe author's response was to lose their temper and tell them to fuck off or leave. They then took the daughter to calm down. The key points here are the intent and the proportionality. The author acted to protect their daughter's mental health, which is a valid concern. The husband not apologizing even after the daughter is upset suggests he wasn't considering her feelings.\n\nHowever, the method of response was harsh. Yelling and using profanity might be seen as excessive, but the motivation was to defend their daughter. The question is whether the means justified the ends. Since the daughter's mental health is at stake, the author's actions were a reaction to protect her. \n\nAlso, the husband and mother's behavior initiated the conflict by publicly criticizing the daughter. The author's outburst was a direct response to that. While the approach was extreme, the underlying reason is understandable and even commendable. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they were trying to support their daughter, even if the method was not the best. The answer is B, meaning the author is not in the wrong.\n"
