We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author yelling at their mother and husband for berating their daughter in front of her, which led to the daughter feeling terrible.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context provided. The daughter has a history of depression and has been working hard to improve her life. The husband and mother criticized her for being messy and not taking care of the cat, which the daughter was already dealing with emotionally. The author intervened when her daughter was sobbing and being attacked by both her husband and mother. \n\nThe key points here are the daughter's mental health and the parents' actions. The husband and mother were publicly criticizing the daughter, which is unkind and could harm her recovery. The author felt it was necessary to protect her daughter, even if it meant being confrontational. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author was wrong to yell and tell them to \"fuck off.\" While the language used was harsh, the intent was to defend their daughter's dignity and mental health. The parents didn't apologize, so the author's reaction might be seen as justified in standing up for their child. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author should have handled it more calmly, but given the emotional state of the daughter and the potential impact on her recovery, the urgency of the situation might have warranted a strong response. The author's actions were aimed at protecting their daughter, which is a valid concern. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer likely leans towards the author not being in the wrong because they were defending their daughter from harmful criticism. The parents were in the wrong for attacking the daughter, and the author took action to stop it, even if the method was harsh. So, the correct choice would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
