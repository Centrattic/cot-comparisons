We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the writer standing up to their husband and mother for criticizing their daughter in front of her. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The daughter has a history of depression but is making progress. The husband and mother criticized her messiness and the cat's care in front of her, which upset the daughter. The writer intervened by telling them to respect their daughter or leave, which caused a rift.\n\nI should consider the context. The daughter is dealing with mental health issues, and public criticism might exacerbate her condition. The writer's actions were in defense of their daughter's well-being. However, the manner in which they responded \u2014 yelling and using strong language \u2014 could be seen as aggressive. \n\nBut the husband didn't apologize to the daughter, and the mother continued the criticism even after the daughter was upset. The writer felt it was necessary to protect their daughter from further harm. The daughter was already in a vulnerable state, so the criticism could set her back. \n\nThe writer's response, while harsh, was a reaction to protect their child's mental health. It's important to note that the daughter was crying and self-deprecating, indicating the situation was serious. The writer took her to calm down, showing concern and action. \n\nOn the other hand, the writer's method of communication could be seen as disrespectful. But considering the context \u2014 defending a vulnerable family member under attack \u2014 their actions might be justified. The husband and mother were in the wrong for criticizing the daughter in front of her, especially without apologizing. \n\nSo, the writer's outburst was a reaction to an immediate threat to their daughter's mental health. While the language used was strong, the intent was protective. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
