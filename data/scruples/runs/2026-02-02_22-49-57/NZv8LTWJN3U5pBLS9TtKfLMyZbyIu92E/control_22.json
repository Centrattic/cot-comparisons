We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, their husband, mother, and daughter. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the daughter recently moved in after a tough breakup and has been dealing with depression. She's made a lot of progress: job, school, therapy. The author is proud. The issue is her messiness, which the husband is upset about. The author is more understanding because the daughter has a lot on her plate.\n\nThen, during their mother's visit, the husband and mother criticized the daughter's messiness in front of her. They even brought up the cat's litter box, which the author has been cleaning. The daughter was upset, cried, and the husband didn't apologize. The author tried to console her, but the parents kept berating her. At that point, the author lost it, told them to stop or \"fuck off,\" took the daughter out, and now there's a rift.\n\nSo, the question is: Is the author in the wrong for yelling at her husband and mother?\n\nLet me consider the dynamics here. The daughter's mental health is a big factor. Public criticism, especially when someone is vulnerable, can be really harmful. The husband and mother's actions might have been insensitive, especially in front of the daughter. The author's response was an outburst, but was it justified?\n\nOn one hand, yelling and using harsh language is not ideal. It's understandable to be upset, but the method might be considered over the top. On the other hand, they were contributing to the daughter's emotional distress, which could set back her recovery. The author's primary concern was protecting her daughter's mental health.\n\nThe husband didn't apologize even when the daughter was hurt, which is concerning. The mother continued the criticism despite the daughter's emotional state. The author intervened when the situation was clearly escalating and harmful. So maybe the author's actions, while harsh, were a reaction to protect her daughter.\n\nBut then again, the author could have handled it differently. Maybe a calmer approach, like confronting the husband and mother privately after the fact, would have been better. However, in the heat of the moment, the immediate reaction was to stop the harm.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at intent and proportionality. The author's intent was to protect her daughter, and the proportionality is debatable. The husband and mother were being unkind in a public way, which the author felt compelled to stop. The daughter's well-being is a significant factor here.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong. The answer would be B (Not in the wrong). The husband and mother's behavior was inappropriate, and the author's outburst was a reaction to protect her daughter's mental health, even if the method was harsh.\n"
