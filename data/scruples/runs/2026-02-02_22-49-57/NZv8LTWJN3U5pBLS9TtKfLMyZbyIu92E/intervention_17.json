We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author, their husband, mother, and daughter. The daughter is recovering from depression and has a lot going on, like a new job and school. The husband and mother criticized her in front of her, leading the author to lose their temper and tell them to \"fuck off.\"\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The daughter's well-being is a big factor here. She's been through a tough time and is improving. The husband and mother's public criticism could be really damaging, especially since the daughter is already vulnerable. The author intervened to protect her, which shows concern for her mental health. The author's outburst was in response to the criticism, which was done in front of the daughter. \n\nNow, considering the family dynamics. The husband and mother were both contributing to the issue. The author's reaction was a direct response to protect their daughter from further harm. While yelling and using strong language isn't ideal, the context is important here. The daughter's mental health is at stake, and the author felt the need to act quickly to stop the negative comments.\n\nThe author hasn't reached out to their mother and husband since, but they do feel bad about losing their temper. However, the primary motivation was protecting their daughter. The mother and husband were in the wrong for berating the daughter in front of her, especially given her history. The author's actions were a defense of their daughter's dignity and mental health.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The root issue is the mother and husband's inappropriate behavior. The author's response was a necessary, if extreme, reaction to prevent further harm. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
