We are compatible and rarely argue. My mother and I have a normal relationship, some minor issues, but nothing serious.\n\nMy daughter (26) got out of a terrible long-term relationship and moved back home with us about a year ago. She has been diagnosed with clinical depression. When she moved in, she struggled with even getting out of bed or showering. Since then, she has done a 180. She got a new full time job, she also is back in school full time because a degree will (hopefully) help her move up in her company, she has also been going to therapy once a week. In my opinion, she is doing fantastic and I am incredibly proud of her. My husband knows all of this.\n\nThe issue is that she can be a bit of a slob. She wasn\u2019t like this before, I think she got into the habit of it at some point when she became depressed. This really annoys my husband, but honestly she has so much on her plate that I, admittedly, cut her some slack. \n\nMy mother came to visit yesterday and somehow she and my husband got on the topic of my daughters messiness IN FRONT OF my daughter. My husband was venting about this and my mother was agreeing with him. He brought up her cat and how I am the one who has been cleaning the cats litter box. They both started berating my daughter, saying she was too old for that and asking her why she was keeping the cat if she can\u2019t take care of it. \n\nMy mother went outside to smoke a cigarette and my daughter (who was now crying) told her dad that he hurt her feelings. My husband did not apologize. I went over to my daughter to console her because at this point she was sobbing. She kept quietly repeating to me \u201cI\u2019m a piece of shit. Everyone thinks I\u2019m a piece of shit.\u201d I\u2019m telling her that is NOT true when my mother comes in.\n\nAnd the pair of them keep going on about it! This is when I lost my temper. I yelled at both of them. I told them to either be respectful toward my daughter or fuck off and that they could have dinner by themselves. \n\nI then took my daughter to get some food and calm down. \n\nI have never spoken to either of them like this. Neither of them have spoken to me since yesterday and I haven\u2019t put forth the effort to speak to them either. I do feel bad for losing my temper, but I am also scared for my daughters mental health and I do not want her to go backwards because dad and my mother make her feel bad about herself.\n\nAITA?\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author telling her mother and husband to \"fuck off\" after they criticized her daughter in front of her.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The daughter is 26, had a tough time recovering from a bad relationship and depression, and is now doing well with a job, school, and therapy. The husband and mother criticized her for being messy and not taking care of the cat, doing this in front of her. The daughter was upset and the husband didn't apologize. The author lost her temper, told them to be respectful or leave, and took her daughter away. Now the family is upset with her, and she feels bad but also concerned for her daughter's mental health.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong. I need to decide if the author was in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nThe main issue here is the public shaming and criticism from the husband and mother. Public criticism can be really harmful, especially for someone with a history of depression. The author acted to protect her daughter's feelings, which is a valid concern. The daughter was already feeling bad, and the parents' behavior could have set her back. The author's outburst was a reaction to defend her daughter. However, telling them to \"fuck off\" is a strong reaction. But considering the context\u2014trying to protect a vulnerable daughter\u2014it might be understandable. \n\nBut is she in the wrong? Well, using harsh language is never ideal, but the intent was to stop the bullying. The husband and mother were at fault for the initial behavior. The author's actions were a response to protect her daughter. So, maybe she's not in the wrong. The question is whether her reaction was justified given the circumstances. Since the daughter's mental health was a priority, her outburst was a way to stop the emotional harm. \n\nAlternatively, maybe she should have handled it differently, like talking to them privately later. But in the moment, she acted to protect her daughter. The fact that she hasn't spoken to them since might be part of the conflict, but she's prioritizing her daughter's well-being. The key here is that the initial criticism was inappropriate, and her reaction was a defense. So the answer is B.\n"
