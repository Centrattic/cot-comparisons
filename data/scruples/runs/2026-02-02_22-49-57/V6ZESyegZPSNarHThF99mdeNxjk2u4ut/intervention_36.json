I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple moved in together, and the girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a sign of trust. The author gave her the password but then found out she was looking through his old data and messages. He changed the passwords to maintain privacy, and she's upset about it.\n\nThe author argues that even though they have nothing to hide, personal privacy is important. The girlfriend feels that by changing the passwords, he's breaking trust. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong, but wants a second opinion.\n\nSo, what's the key here? Trust is a big part of relationships, but so is personal privacy. The author didn't hide anything malicious; he just wanted to keep past, irrelevant stuff private. The girlfriend's actions of going through his messages might be seen as overstepping, even if she had the password. \n\nIn relationships, boundaries are important. The author might be setting a boundary to protect his privacy, which is reasonable. However, the girlfriend might feel that the password sharing was a mutual agreement, so revoking access could be seen as breaking that trust. \n\nBut the author did give the password initially, maybe under the assumption that mutual trust would prevent prying. When she started going through his things, he felt the need to set limits. That's about protecting his personal space, which is a valid need. \n\nSo, the conflict is between trust and privacy. The author's action is about maintaining privacy, which is a right. The girlfriend's expectation is based on trust, which is also valid. But in this case, the author is taking a stand for his own boundaries, which is reasonable. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. He's setting personal boundaries to maintain privacy, which is important even in a trusting relationship. The girlfriend's actions might be overreaching, and the author's response is about self-respect and privacy.\n"
