I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about changing passwords to prevent a girlfriend from accessing personal devices. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend wants shared passwords to show trust. The author gave her the password but now wants to change it because the girlfriend has been going through his stuff. He found it embarrassing when she found old things like browser history, ex conversations, and messages. He changed the passwords to have privacy.\n\nSo, the main question is whether changing passwords is wrong. The girlfriend argues that trust is important, but the author feels the need for privacy. \n\nI think privacy is a reasonable expectation, even in a relationship. Everyone has personal stuff from the past that they might not want shared. The girlfriend's actions of going through his devices without permission are actually the problem here. The author isn't hiding something malicious; he's just protecting his past, which is normal. \n\nBut maybe some people would say that once you're in a relationship, you should have full transparency. However, that's not realistic for everyone. The key point is that the author isn't hiding current issues but past things that don't affect the current relationship. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's behavior of searching through his messages and devices without his presence is invasive. The author changing passwords to prevent that is a reasonable step. He's not being secretive; he's setting boundaries. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
