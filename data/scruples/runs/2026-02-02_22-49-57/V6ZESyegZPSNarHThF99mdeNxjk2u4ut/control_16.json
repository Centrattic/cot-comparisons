I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for changing their passwords after their girlfriend accessed personal information on their devices.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend wanted shared passwords to show trust. The author agreed to give her their password, which shows a willingness to be open. However, the girlfriend then went through his browser history, old messages, and even his phone conversations. The author feels that even though there's nothing to hide, the invasion of privacy is uncomfortable and they want their own space.\n\nThe key points here are consent and boundaries. The author gave the password intending for it to be used in good faith, but the girlfriend used it to access personal content without his explicit consent. The author's response was to change the passwords to regain privacy, which is a reasonable action. Trust doesn't mean allowing unilateral access to all personal data, especially when it's done without asking. The author has a right to privacy, even in a relationship. The girlfriend's reaction suggests she might not respect these boundaries, which is more her issue. So the author isn't in the wrong for setting those boundaries. Answer B.\n"
