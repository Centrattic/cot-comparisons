I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the given situation is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The author moved in with their girlfriend and had a discussion about sharing passwords. The author didn't want the girlfriend's passwords, but gave her their own. The girlfriend then went through the author's past data\u2014porn history, old Skype chats with an ex, old photos from a phone in a box, and even looked at their messages when they weren't around. The author changed the passwords to regain privacy, and the girlfriend is upset, saying they should trust each other.\n\nThe key points here are consent and mutual agreement on privacy boundaries. The author clearly stated their expectation of privacy, similar to their request for the girlfriend's passwords. The girlfriend didn't respect that boundary, invading the author's privacy. The author's response was to reestablish their own privacy by changing passwords, which is a reasonable action when someone's trust has been breached.\n\nTrust is a two-way street. The girlfriend's actions show a lack of respect for the author's privacy, even if she was given access initially. The author's decision to change passwords isn't about hiding things but about protecting their own personal space. The author isn't in the wrong because they have the right to privacy, and the girlfriend overstepped her bounds. \n\nI should also consider if there's any nuance I'm missing. The author gave the password but didn't expect the girlfriend to snoop beyond what was necessary. The fact that she found things from years ago that are irrelevant now suggests she's prying into areas that aren't her concern. The author's actions are a necessary step to protect their personal data after being violated. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
