I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. The situation involves the girlfriend wanting shared access as a trust-building measure, while the author feels entitled to privacy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend's perspective is about trust and transparency in the relationship. She's brought up sharing passwords as a way to show mutual trust. The author, on the other hand, feels that their privacy is being invaded when the girlfriend accesses old messages, photos, and browser history without their knowledge. The author isn't hiding anything but finds it uncomfortable that their past is being scrutinized.\n\nThe key points here are consent and boundaries. The author initially shared their password, which the girlfriend used to access information. But when the author felt that their privacy was being violated, they decided to change passwords. The question is whether this action breaches trust or is a necessary boundary.\n\nIn relationships, trust is important, but so is personal privacy. Everyone has the right to some level of privacy, especially in digital spaces. The fact that the author isn't hiding anything but still feels uncomfortable with their past being accessed suggests that the issue is about respect for personal space. The girlfriend might see password sharing as a sign of trust, but the author sees password sharing as a mutual agreement that doesn't necessarily extend to unlimited access.\n\nThe author's actions are about reclaiming their privacy. The girlfriend's behavior of going through messages without consent is invasive. Even if the author isn't hiding anything, the act of being snooped without permission is a boundary violation. Changing passwords is a way to set that boundary, which is reasonable.\n\nHowever, there's a counterargument: if both agreed to share passwords, the author might be seen as breaking trust by revoking access. But the initial agreement might not have included unrestricted access to all data, especially past content that's not relevant now. The author's discomfort with their old data being accessed shows that the original understanding might not have been fully mutual.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author expressed their discomfort, but the girlfriend didn't respect that. The author's decision to change passwords is a legitimate response to protect their privacy after feeling that their boundaries were not respected. So the author isn't in the wrong; they're asserting their right to privacy within a relationship where that boundary was previously not respected.\n"
