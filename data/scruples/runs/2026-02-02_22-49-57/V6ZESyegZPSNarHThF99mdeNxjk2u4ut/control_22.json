I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend moving in together and wanting to share passwords to show trust. The author gave her his password, but then she went through his stuff and found old things, which he found embarrassing. Now he wants to change passwords to maintain privacy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the girlfriend wanted to share passwords as a sign of trust. The author gave her the password initially, but maybe he realized that having his private data accessed wasn't comfortable for him. On the other hand, the girlfriend is upset because she feels the password change is a breach of trust.\n\nI should think about privacy rights. Even in a relationship, people often expect some level of personal privacy. The author isn't doing anything illegal or unethical by wanting to protect his own devices. The girlfriend's actions of going through his messages and browsing history without permission might be the real issue here. The author is trying to set boundaries after feeling his privacy was invaded.\n\nAlso, the fact that the author is changing passwords specifically so she can't access them when he's not around suggests he's trying to maintain a balance between trust and privacy. He's not hiding something new; he's just blocking access to old, irrelevant data. The girlfriend's reaction is about trust, but her actions of snooping might be the root problem.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, while sharing passwords can be a gesture of trust, it's also important that both partners respect each other's boundaries. The author has the right to change his passwords if he feels uncomfortable with his privacy being invaded. So, the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
