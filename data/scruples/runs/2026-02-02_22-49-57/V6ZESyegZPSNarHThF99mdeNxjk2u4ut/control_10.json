I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective.

I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for changing their passwords to keep their girlfriend from accessing their devices. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the person and their girlfriend moved in together. The girlfriend wanted to share passwords as a sign of trust. The author was okay with giving her the password but mentioned that they don't need the girlfriend's passwords because they don't see a reason to look through her stuff. But the author did give the password, saying there's nothing to hide.\n\nThen, the girlfriend started finding things like old porn in the browser history, old Skype messages with an ex from 2013, pictures on an old phone in a box, and she was going through the author's messages. The author is now changing the passwords to regain privacy. The girlfriend is upset, saying they should trust each other.\n\nSo, the main question is: is the author in the wrong for taking back their privacy by changing passwords? \n\nOn one hand, when they agreed to share the password, the girlfriend was using it to access things. The author might feel that their privacy is being invaded, especially with old, irrelevant stuff being found. The author's actions could be seen as reclaiming their right to privacy, even in a relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that by initially sharing the password, the author gave consent for her to have access. Changing the password could be seen as a lack of trust or breaking a previous agreement. But the author's reason is to protect past, irrelevant data, not to hide current or harmful things. \n\nI think the key here is mutual respect for privacy. The girlfriend was going through the author's personal communications, which is an invasion of privacy regardless of the content. The author has the right to set boundaries. Changing passwords is a reasonable step to protect their privacy. The girlfriend's trust issues might stem from her actions, not the author's. So the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
