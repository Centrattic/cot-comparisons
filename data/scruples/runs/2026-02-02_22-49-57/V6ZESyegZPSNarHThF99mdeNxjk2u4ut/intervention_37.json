I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for changing their passwords so their girlfriend can't access their devices. The situation is that they moved in together, and the girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a sign of trust. The author initially gave her the password, saying there's nothing to hide. But then the girlfriend found old stuff like browser history, old messages, and even went through the author's phone. The author is now changing the passwords to maintain privacy, but the girlfriend is upset, saying they should trust each other.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's actions: changing passwords to protect their privacy. The girlfriend's perspective: expecting trust and access. \n\nIn relationships, trust is a big part, but so is personal privacy. Just because someone shares passwords doesn't mean they're okay with their partner sifting through their old data. The author might feel that their privacy is being invaded when the girlfriend looks through their phone or computer, even if the content is harmless. The key here is consent. The author gave the password with the expectation that it's for accessing the device, not for prying into old messages or history.\n\nThe girlfriend might feel that sharing passwords is about trust, but maybe she misunderstood the boundaries. The author has a right to their own privacy, even in a relationship. Changing passwords isn't about hiding something new but about protecting past interactions that are now irrelevant. It's about setting boundaries to feel comfortable in the shared space.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel hurt or like the author isn't fully trusting her. But trust shouldn't require complete access to all personal data, especially if it's old and not relevant now. The author isn't hiding anything current; they're just asserting their right to keep certain things private.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for changing the passwords. They're setting healthy boundaries to maintain their privacy, which is necessary even in a trusting relationship. The girlfriend's actions of going through old messages without permission could be the issue here. The author is taking steps to prevent further invasions of privacy, which is reasonable.\n"
