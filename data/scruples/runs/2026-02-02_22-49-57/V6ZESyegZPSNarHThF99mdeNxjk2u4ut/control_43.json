I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person and their girlfriend moved in together. The girlfriend wanted to share passwords to show trust. The author gave her the password because they had nothing to hide. But then the girlfriend went through the author's stuff\u2014found old browser history, old conversations, pictures, and even checked messages when she walked in. The author is now changing the passwords to keep their privacy, and the girlfriend is upset, saying they should trust each other.\n\nHmm. The author's main point is about privacy. They mention that even though there's nothing to hide, the things found were from the past and maybe embarrassing. The girlfriend is using the lack of passwords as a way to access personal info, which the author might not be comfortable with.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault for changing passwords. On one hand, sharing passwords might be seen as a sign of trust, but on the other, everyone has a right to personal privacy. The author isn't hiding anything illegal or harmful; it's just old stuff. The girlfriend's actions might be invasive, even if the author initially agreed to share. Maybe the author realized that sharing passwords allows access to personal data they didn't want to be seen. \n\nThe key here is that privacy is a reasonable expectation. Even in a relationship, people might want some personal space. The author isn't hiding things, just setting boundaries. The girlfriend is upset, but the author's actions are about reclaiming privacy, not deception. \n\nSo, the answer would probably be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They have a right to their privacy, and changing passwords to prevent unauthorized access is reasonable. The girlfriend's expectations might be unrealistic if she's going through personal stuff without consent. The author isn't being dishonest; they're protecting their personal information, which is a valid action.\n"
