I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong.\n\nSo the situation is that the person and their girlfriend moved in together. The girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a sign of trust. The guy gave her his password but didn't like that she looked through his stuff, even though he said there's nothing to hide. Now he's changing his passwords again to keep her out, and she's upset about it. He's wondering if he's at fault for doing that.\n\nHmm. First, the girlfriend wanted access, but the guy didn't want to share everything. Sharing passwords is a personal choice. Even if you agree to share initially, it's okay to set boundaries later. The guy gave her access but then felt uncomfortable with her going through his private stuff. That's a privacy issue. When she found things in his history, it's understandable he's embarrassed, even if the things themselves are harmless.\n\nChanging passwords to maintain privacy isn't inherently wrong. Just because they're in a relationship doesn't mean they have to share everything. Everyone has a right to some privacy. The girlfriend might feel hurt, but the guy has a right to set boundaries. The key here is mutual respect. If the guy communicated his need for privacy and changed passwords to protect his personal space, that's not being in the wrong. The girlfriend might need to respect that, even if she's disappointed.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). He's taking steps to protect his privacy after feeling invaded. It's a balance between trust and personal space. The issue might be in the communication, but the action of changing passwords itself isn't wrong.\n"
