I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for changing their passwords after their girlfriend accessed their personal devices and found old, unrelated stuff. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a sign of trust. The author initially gave her the password, thinking there was nothing to hide. But then the girlfriend found and commented on old browser history, old messages, and even checked the author's phone. The author now feels their privacy is invaded, so they're changing passwords again.\n\nThe key points here are about trust and boundaries. The author isn't hiding anything new; the girlfriend is prying into past data that the author didn't intend to share. The author's action is about reclaiming privacy, which is a reasonable step. Trust is mutual, but it doesn't mean one should have unlimited access to the other's personal devices. The girlfriend's actions are overstepping by looking through old messages and such without permission. \n\nThe author's response is about setting boundaries. They're not hiding anything current, just protecting their past information. The girlfriend's argument that there's no reason for the passwords isn't valid because the author has a right to privacy. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
