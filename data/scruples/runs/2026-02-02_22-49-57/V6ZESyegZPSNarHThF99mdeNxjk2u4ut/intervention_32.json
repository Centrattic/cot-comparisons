I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the person is at fault for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend asked for shared passwords as a sign of trust. The author agreed to give her the password but set boundaries by not asking for hers. The girlfriend then went through his stuff, found personal things, and he feels his privacy is being invaded. He changes the passwords to regain some privacy.\n\nFrom a privacy standpoint, everyone has a right to their own personal space. Even in a relationship, it's common for people to keep certain things private. The girlfriend's actions of going through his messages and devices without explicit permission might be seen as overstepping. The author changing passwords is a way to set a boundary, which is a reasonable response. \n\nOn the other hand, trust is important in relationships. The girlfriend might feel that changing passwords is a breach of trust. But the author's actions are about protecting personal privacy, not hiding something. The key here is consent. If she's accessing his devices without his current consent, that's an issue. The author's response is about reclaiming control over his personal data. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. He's asserting his right to privacy after feeling invaded. The problem lies more with the girlfriend's behavior than the author's response. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
