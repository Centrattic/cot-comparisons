I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for changing their passwords so their girlfriend can't access their devices. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The writer gave their girlfriend access to their passwords initially because they felt there was nothing to hide. But then the girlfriend started going through their private information\u2014browser history, old messages, photos, and even checking their phone without permission. The writer is now changing the passwords to maintain privacy, and the girlfriend is upset, arguing that trust should be complete.\n\nSo, the key points are: the girlfriend accessed private information without permission, which the writer finds invasive and embarrassing. The writer wants privacy but the girlfriend feels it's a lack of trust. \n\nI think the writer isn't in the wrong here. Everyone has a right to privacy, even in a relationship. The girlfriend's actions cross boundaries by going through personal data without consent. The writer's decision to change passwords is a reasonable step to protect their privacy. The girlfriend might feel hurt, but it's not the writer's responsibility to accommodate her discomfort if it infringes on their personal space. Trust is mutual, but respecting each other's boundaries is essential. The writer isn't hiding anything malicious; they just want their privacy back. So the answer should be B.\n"
