I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple moved in together, and the girlfriend has been asking to share passwords. The author gave her their password because they felt there was nothing to hide. However, the girlfriend found various things like porn in the browser history, old conversations with an ex, and private messages. The author now wants to change their passwords to regain some privacy, but the girlfriend is upset, arguing that trust should mean no need for passwords.\n\nSo, the key points here are: mutual sharing of passwords as a trust gesture, the girlfriend's intrusion into the author's private data, and the author's response to set boundaries by changing passwords.\n\nI need to determine if the author is wrong for doing that. From what I know, privacy in relationships is a gray area. While sharing passwords can be seen as a sign of trust, it's also important for individuals to have personal privacy. The problem here is that the girlfriend is prying into things the author considers private, even if they have nothing to hide. The author's reaction is to set boundaries, which is a reasonable step. \n\nThe girlfriend's behavior might be overstepping, especially if she's using the shared passwords to access information without consent. The author isn't hiding anything malicious; they're just protecting their past communications and personal files. Changing passwords to prevent unauthorized access isn't about hiding secrets but about maintaining personal space. \n\nIn healthy relationships, both partners should respect each other's boundaries. The author isn't doing anything wrong by asserting their need for privacy. The real issue might be the girlfriend not respecting those boundaries once they were established. So, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
