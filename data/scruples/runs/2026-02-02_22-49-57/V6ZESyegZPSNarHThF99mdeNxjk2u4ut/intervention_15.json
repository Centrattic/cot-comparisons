I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. The situation is about privacy versus trust in a relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The girlfriend wants shared passwords as a sign of trust, but the author is uncomfortable. The author gave her the password but later found out that the girlfriend is going through his old stuff and messages, which he finds embarrassing. Now he's changing the passwords again to maintain privacy, but she's upset and thinks they should trust each other.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, the girlfriend might see shared passwords as a gesture of trust and openness. On the other hand, the author has a right to privacy. The fact that the girlfriend is going through his devices without his consent could justify the author's actions. \n\nIn relationships, boundaries are important. Even though couples might share certain things, personal privacy is also a valid boundary. The author isn't hiding anything malicious but wants to keep past conversations and data private. The girlfriend's actions of snooping without permission might be the real issue here. \n\nSo, the author changing passwords to protect his privacy isn't necessarily wrong. He's setting boundaries to protect his personal space. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from feeling insecure or not respected, but the author's actions are about maintaining his own comfort and privacy. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong. He's asserting his right to privacy in a relationship where boundaries are important.\n"
