I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend wanting shared access to each other's devices, but the author is now cutting that off after she found some personal stuff.\n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy in relationships. Even though they're in a relationship and moved in together, people still have a right to privacy. The author initially gave her the password because they felt there was nothing to hide. But after the girlfriend started going through his things, the author changed their mind. That makes sense because mutual respect for privacy is important. \n\nThe girlfriend's actions of checking his messages and apps without permission could be seen as a breach of trust. The author is now setting boundaries to protect their privacy, which is a reasonable step. The fact that the author is on the fence suggests they're trying to balance trust and personal space. \n\nSo, the question is whether changing passwords is a justified response. I think it is. The author isn't hiding anything malicious, just personal, past conversations. The girlfriend's reaction is about expecting transparency, but the author is reclaiming their privacy. Neither is entirely in the wrong, but the author's action is a valid boundary. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
