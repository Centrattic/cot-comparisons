I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for changing their passwords. The situation involves a girlfriend wanting access to their devices to show trust, but the person is now changing passwords to maintain privacy after their partner looked through personal stuff.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The girlfriend asked for passwords to show trust, and the author initially gave theirs. But the girlfriend then found old browser history, Skype conversations, pictures, and even went through phone messages. The author feels the need to change passwords to protect their privacy, leading to conflict.\n\nSo, the main issue is about privacy versus trust in a relationship. The author is concerned about past content that's now irrelevant but was found by the girlfriend. The girlfriend sees the password change as a breach of trust.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, trust is important. However, privacy is also a personal right. The author might feel that their boundaries were crossed when the girlfriend accessed their private data without permission, even if unintentionally. Changing passwords could be a way to set those boundaries back.\n\nI should check if there's any cultural or societal expectations here. In some contexts, sharing passwords is seen as a gesture of trust. But if one party is uncomfortable after their privacy is invaded, it's reasonable to reassess. The author isn't hiding anything new; they just want their past data to stay private.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is also a factor. If she's upset about the password change, maybe she didn't consider the author's need for privacy. However, the author should communicate their reasons clearly to avoid misunderstandings.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't doing anything illegal. They're protecting their digital privacy, which is a legitimate concern. The girlfriend's actions of going through the author's devices without consent might be the real issue here. The author's response is a way to reclaim that privacy.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're asserting their right to privacy after their boundaries were crossed.\n"
