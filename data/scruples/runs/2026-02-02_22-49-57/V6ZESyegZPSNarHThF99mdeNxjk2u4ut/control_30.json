I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So, the situation is that they moved in with their girlfriend and she wanted to share passwords to show trust. The author gave her their password, but then the girlfriend found some personal stuff from the past and started prying into their messages. The author feels uncomfortable and wants to change the passwords to maintain privacy. The question is whether changing the passwords makes the author at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy rights. Even in a relationship, people might expect some level of personal space. The girlfriend is going through old messages and files, which might be crossing a boundary. The author isn't hiding anything malicious; they're just concerned about old, irrelevant content being found. \n\nTrust is a big part of relationships, but trust shouldn't mean giving up all personal privacy. The girlfriend's actions\u2014like looking through messages when the author isn't around\u2014could be seen as invasive. The author is trying to set boundaries, which is reasonable. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that the author isn't being transparent. But if the author isn't doing anything wrong, why hide? The key here is that the author isn't hiding current issues but past things that don't affect the current relationship. \n\nThe author gave the password initially, but the girlfriend's behavior led them to reconsider. Changing passwords to prevent invasion of privacy isn't necessarily wrong. It's about mutual respect and boundaries. So, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong because they're protecting their privacy without deceit.\n"
