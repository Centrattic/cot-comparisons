I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person and their girlfriend moved in together. The girlfriend wanted to share passwords as a sign of trust. The author gave her the password but later found that the girlfriend was going through their private stuff\u2014browser history, old messages, etc. The author then changed the passwords to regain privacy, leading to conflict.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent and privacy boundaries. When the author gave the password, they probably expected that it would be a mutual agreement, but the girlfriend overstepped by invading the author's privacy. The author's action of changing the password is a response to feeling their privacy was violated. \n\nIn relationships, mutual respect for each other's privacy is important. Even though the girlfriend might have seen sharing passwords as trust, using that access to look through past conversations and data without consent isn't respectful. The author has the right to set boundaries, especially when they feel uncomfortable. \n\nThe girlfriend's argument about trust is valid in that sharing passwords can be a gesture, but it shouldn't come at the cost of someone's privacy. The author's decision to revoke access is about protecting their own personal space, which is reasonable. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to adjust their boundaries, especially after experiencing unwanted intrusion. The girlfriend needs to respect those boundaries moving forward.\n"
