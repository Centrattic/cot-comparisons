I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if changing passwords to maintain privacy is wrong. The situation involves moving in with a girlfriend who wanted shared access to devices. The author initially gave her the password, but after she found personal stuff and snooped, he's changing things back.\n\nFirst, the key points: Trust is important in relationships, but so is privacy. The author made it clear he didn't want her password, but he gave his for transparency. She then found things, which led to embarrassment. Now, he's setting boundaries by changing passwords to protect his privacy.\n\nThe girlfriend is upset because she feels trust is important. But the author argues that privacy is necessary. The question is whether setting those boundaries makes him wrong. \n\nIn relationships, mutual respect for each other's needs is crucial. The author isn't hiding anything; he's just reclaiming his personal space. The girlfriend's actions of snooping (checking messages without asking) might be the real issue here. \n\nSo, the author is trying to protect his privacy after setting boundaries that were ignored. That seems reasonable. The answer would be B, not in the wrong.\n"
