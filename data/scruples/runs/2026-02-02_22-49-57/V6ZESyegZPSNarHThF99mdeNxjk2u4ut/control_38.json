I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend and boyfriend moving in together and sharing passwords. The boyfriend initially gave her his password but now changed it after she went through his stuff, found some old things, and invaded his privacy by checking his phone. He feels the need to have his own privacy and changed the passwords, but she's upset, thinking they should trust each other.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The boyfriend has a right to privacy, especially in personal devices. Even if there's nothing to hide, the fact that she's going through his old messages and such without his consent is a problem. Trust is important in a relationship, but that doesn't mean one person should have unrestricted access to the other's private data. The girlfriend's actions might be seen as overstepping boundaries, even if she thinks it's about trust.\n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend did initially give her the password, which might have set an expectation of access. But he later changed it after feeling his privacy was violated. The key here is whether changing the passwords was a reasonable response to protect his privacy after she breached his trust by going through his stuff. \n\nIn relationships, boundaries are crucial. The boyfriend is asserting his right to keep certain things private. The girlfriend's expectation of access might not be realistic if it leads to prying into past conversations or files. So, the boyfriend changing the passwords to maintain his own privacy is understandable and reasonable. Therefore, he's not in the wrong.\n"
