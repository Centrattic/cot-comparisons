I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a girlfriend wanting shared passwords, and the author changed them after she looked through personal stuff.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The girlfriend brought up sharing passwords as a trust issue. The author agreed to give her the password but then changed it when he realized she was going through his private data. He's worried about privacy, and she's upset because she thinks they should trust each other.\n\nSo, the main question is about whether changing passwords is a justified act of protecting privacy or a breach of trust. The author isn't hiding anything now, but past conversations and data make him uncomfortable. His argument is about privacy, which is a valid concern even in relationships. People might have different boundaries regarding personal devices and data.\n\nThe girlfriend might feel that the author was deceptive because he initially gave her the password, implying trust, and then changed it later. That could look like a betrayal. But the author's change of heart comes from a place of wanting privacy after experiencing intrusion. \n\nI think it's a balance between trust and personal privacy. The author's actions were to reclaim his privacy, which is understandable. However, he might need to communicate better with his girlfriend to set boundaries without causing hurt. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's protecting his privacy, which is a personal right. But maybe I should check if there's a cultural or common expectation that sharing passwords is a norm. However, even in relationships, people can have different comfort levels. Since the author didn't have anything to hide and is just seeking privacy, it's reasonable.\n"
