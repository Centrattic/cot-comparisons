I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The situation involves a girlfriend who wanted shared access to each other's devices, but the author decided to set boundaries by changing passwords after the girlfriend accessed his personal data.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend initiated the idea of sharing passwords as a trust-building measure. The author agreed to give her his password, showing initial openness. However, the girlfriend then went through his private data, which made him uncomfortable. He changed the passwords to regain privacy, leading her to feel upset about the lack of trust.\n\nKey points to consider: Trust in relationships is mutual, but privacy is also a personal right. The author's actions were to protect his personal space after feeling invaded. The girlfriend's behavior of accessing his data without permission, even if well-intentioned, crossed a boundary. The author's response is about setting healthy boundaries, which is important for any relationship. While trust is essential, it doesn't mean giving up all privacy. So, the author isn't in the wrong for asserting his need for privacy after the misuse of his trust.\n"
