I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend wanting shared access to each other's devices as a trust thing. The guy gave her his password but then changed it later because she was going through his stuff and found old stuff that embarrassed him. Now he's being accused of not trusting her.\n\nHmm. First, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a sign of trust. He initially gave her access, but she started going through his private data. He felt his privacy was invaded, so he changed the passwords. Now he's being blamed for not trusting her.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nTrust is a big part of relationships, but so is personal privacy. The girlfriend might see shared passwords as mutual trust, but the guy might need personal boundaries. The problem is that she accessed his private data without consent, which is a breach of trust. By changing the passwords, he's trying to set boundaries to protect his privacy. \n\nBut from her perspective, she might feel that by changing the passwords, he's being secretive. However, the fact that she was going through his things without a valid reason is the initial issue. The guy isn't hiding anything; he's just reclaiming his privacy. \n\nIn healthy relationships, both partners should respect each other's boundaries. If she's okay with him not needing her passwords but expects him to trust her by not having access, that's a mismatch. But he's not the one violating trust here. She did when she went through his stuff. \n\nSo, changing passwords to protect privacy isn't wrong. It's about setting personal boundaries. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
