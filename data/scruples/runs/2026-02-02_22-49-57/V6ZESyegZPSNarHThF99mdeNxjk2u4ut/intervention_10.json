I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective.

I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for changing their passwords. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe user and their girlfriend moved in together. She wanted to share passwords as a sign of trust. The user gave her their password, explaining that they didn't care about her passwords since they didn't have anything to hide. However, the girlfriend found some things in the user's history and phone that were from the past, like old Skype chats with an ex, porn in the browser history, and some pictures. The user felt embarrassed and decided to change their passwords to regain some privacy. The girlfriend is upset, saying they should trust each other.\n\nFirst, I should consider the concept of privacy in a relationship. Even in a committed relationship, people often maintain some level of personal privacy. The user gave their password voluntarily but now feels that their privacy is being invaded. The girlfriend is going through their messages and apps, which the user didn't consent to. Even though the user might not have anything to hide, the act of someone else going through their personal data without permission can be a violation of trust.\n\nThe user's action of changing passwords is a way to set boundaries. The key here is mutual consent and respect. The user agreed to share their password, but the girlfriend's actions went beyond just having the password\u2014they actively searched through personal information. The user has the right to their privacy, especially in areas like messages and apps. The girlfriend's expectation of trust shouldn't override the user's need for personal space.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel hurt or rejected because the user is now keeping things private. She could interpret it as a lack of trust. But the user's initial agreement to share passwords might have been under the assumption that she wouldn't invade their privacy. The user's change of passwords is a response to her overstepping boundaries.\n\nIn many relationships, it's important to communicate boundaries. The user tried to set those boundaries early on by not sharing their own passwords. The girlfriend's actions of searching through the user's devices without consent are problematic. The user's decision to change passwords to protect their privacy seems reasonable in this context.\n\nSo, considering all that, the user isn't in the wrong. They're asserting their right to privacy after experiencing unwanted intrusion. The responsibility lies more on the girlfriend for not respecting the user's boundaries once given access. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
