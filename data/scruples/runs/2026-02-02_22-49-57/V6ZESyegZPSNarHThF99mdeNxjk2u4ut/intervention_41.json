I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The situation is that the author and their girlfriend moved in together. The girlfriend wanted to share passwords as a sign of trust. The author initially gave their password but later changed it because the girlfriend accessed personal and past content that embarrassed them.\n\nThe key points here are consent and privacy. The author made it clear they didn't want the girlfriend to have their passwords, but they gave it anyway. Then the girlfriend accessed private data without the author's permission. The author changed the passwords to regain privacy. \n\nIn relationships, mutual respect for each other's boundaries is important. The girlfriend went through the author's personal information without consent, which is a breach of trust. The author's decision to change passwords to protect their privacy is a reasonable response. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong for doing so. \n\nThe options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). The user thinks the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B. The main reasoning is that the author has a right to privacy and the girlfriend overstepped by accessing private information without permission. Changing passwords to maintain privacy is justified here.\n"
