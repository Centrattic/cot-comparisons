I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for changing their passwords. The situation is that the couple moved in together, the girlfriend wanted to share passwords as a sign of trust. The author gave her his password, but then she found old stuff and started going through his messages. He's now changing the passwords to regain privacy.\n\nHmm, the key points here. The girlfriend wanted shared access, but the author didn't want to access hers. But when she had access, she went through his private stuff. The author is now taking back control by changing passwords, which the girlfriend sees as a breach of trust. \n\nI need to decide if the author is wrong. Well, trust is a big part of relationships, but so is individual privacy. The girlfriend initiated the password sharing, and the author gave it out, assuming mutual access. But she then invaded his privacy by looking through his stuff. He's not hiding anything, but he's entitled to some privacy. \n\nChanging passwords isn't about hiding things, but about setting boundaries. The author is trying to protect his personal space. The girlfriend's actions\u2014going through his messages and finding old files\u2014might have made him feel uncomfortable. He's responding by securing his devices, which is a reasonable step to maintain his privacy without being secretive. \n\nThe girlfriend's expectation of access might be too high. If she's upset about losing access, maybe she needs to understand that privacy is important even in relationships. The author isn't doing anything wrong by setting these boundaries. He's just reclaiming his right to privacy after her actions made him uncomfortable. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He's taking steps to protect his privacy, which is valid after her actions. The girlfriend might need to work on respecting those boundaries instead of expecting unrestricted access.\n"
