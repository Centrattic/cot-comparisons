I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple moved in together. The girlfriend asked for shared passwords to show trust. The guy gave her his password because he felt there was nothing to hide. But then she found old stuff like browser history, Skype chats, and old phone pictures. He's now changing his passwords again because he feels his privacy is being invaded, even though he doesn't mind her finding those things, just the intrusion makes him uncomfortable. He's worried about being called out for not trusting her.\n\nSo, the main points here are about privacy vs. trust in a relationship. The guy gave his password initially, which allowed her access. She then went through his devices, which made him uncomfortable. He changed the passwords to reclaim his privacy. \n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. The key factors are: Did he have a right to privacy even after giving her the password? Did she overstep by going through his personal data? \n\nIn relationships, trust is important, but so is mutual respect for boundaries. When he gave her the password, he might have expected her not to look through his personal stuff. However, she might have felt that having access meant he should be okay with her checking. But if he didn't want her to look through his old messages, maybe he shouldn't have given her the password in the first place. However, after she did go through his data, he feels the need to set boundaries again. \n\nThe problem is that by giving the password, he allowed her access. If she used that access to invade his privacy, then maybe he's within his rights to change the passwords again. The fact that he's changing the passwords to maintain privacy suggests he's trying to set boundaries, which is reasonable. \n\nBut some might argue that once you share a password, you can't expect privacy. However, the girlfriend's actions might have crossed a line by going through his personal data without his consent, even if it was after he gave her the password. \n\nIn many relationships, privacy is a mutual expectation. Even if you share some information, there's an understanding that personal things won't be pried into. If she violated that unspoken boundary, then the guy is justified in protecting his privacy again. \n\nSo considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He's setting reasonable boundaries to protect his privacy after feeling it was invaded. The girlfriend's actions might be the real issue here.\n"
