I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The scenario is about a girlfriend and her partner moving in together. The girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a sign of trust, and the guy initially gave his password but later changed it after she went through his stuff. Now he's wondering if he's at fault for doing that.\n\nHmm, so first, the guy was okay with sharing the password initially, which shows he wasn't against it. But then he noticed she was prying into his past stuff, which made him uncomfortable. He changed the passwords to regain some privacy. The girlfriend is upset because she feels this is a breach of trust.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. On one hand, sharing passwords can be seen as a gesture of trust, especially in a committed relationship. But on the other hand, everyone has a right to some level of privacy. The girl going through his messages and past data without his consent might be the real issue here. If he felt that her actions were invasive, then changing passwords could be his way of setting boundaries.\n\nThe key points here are consent and mutual respect. The girlfriend's actions of checking his messages and old data without his okay might be the root problem. The guy's decision to change passwords is a boundary he's setting to protect his privacy. So, maybe he's not wrong for doing that. Relationships need trust, but they also need mutual respect for personal space. If the girlfriend expected access, perhaps she didn't consider his need for privacy. \n\nBut wait, when he gave her the password initially, he might have implied that she had access. So changing it later could be seen as a betrayal of that trust. However, if he felt uncomfortable after seeing how she used that access, then it's his right to adjust the agreement. \n\nIn many cases, both partners should have clear boundaries about privacy. The fact that she went through his stuff without his consent might mean she overstepped, giving him reason to take back control of his devices. So the answer might be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
