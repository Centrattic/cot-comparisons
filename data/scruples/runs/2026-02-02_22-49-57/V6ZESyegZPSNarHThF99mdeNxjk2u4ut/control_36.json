I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend wanting shared access to their devices to show trust. The author gave her the password once but later changed it when the girlfriend started looking through old stuff and made them uncomfortable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend's perspective is that sharing passwords is a sign of trust, and she felt hurt when the passwords were changed. She mentioned finding things like porn, old messages, and pictures. She might feel she's being kept at a distance, even if there's nothing to hide.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is setting boundaries for their own privacy. They might feel that even though there's nothing to hide, they deserve some personal space. The fact that the girlfriend was going through their messages without consent could be a privacy issue. The author's action of changing passwords is a way to protect their privacy and prevent further invasions.\n\nNow, thinking about societal norms and relationships. While trust is important in relationships, mutual respect for privacy is also crucial. The girlfriend's actions of going through private messages and searching for old files might be seen as overstepping boundaries. The author is trying to maintain their own privacy, which is a valid concern.\n\nThe key point here is consent and mutual agreement. The author did share the password initially, but the girlfriend's subsequent actions made the author uncomfortable. Changing the password is a reasonable response to protect their privacy. The author isn't hiding anything malicious; they just want to stop the uncomfortable intrusions.\n\nHowever, communication is a big part of relationships. The author might need to explain their reasons for changing the password and discuss boundaries. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the girlfriend was invading privacy, the author's action is more about self-protection rather than deceit. So, the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
