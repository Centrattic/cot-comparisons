I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The situation is about moving in with a girlfriend and sharing passwords. The author initially gave her the password but later changed it after she went through his things. The girlfriend is upset because she feels it's about trust.\n\nHmm. The key points here are privacy versus trust. The author didn't want to share initially but gave the password. Then, after the girlfriend accessed private stuff, he changed the passwords. The girlfriend argues they should trust each other, but the author wants privacy.\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong. Everyone deserves some personal space. Even if they're in a relationship, having boundaries is important. The girlfriend went through his messages and found old stuff, which he found embarrassing. Changing passwords to maintain privacy isn't about distrust but about personal boundaries. The girlfriend might be overstepping, so the author's action is reasonable. So answer B.\n"
