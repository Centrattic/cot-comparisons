I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about changing passwords to prevent the girlfriend from accessing their devices. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend suggested sharing passwords to show trust. The author gave her the password, even though he was hesitant. Then she started looking through his stuff, finding old stuff like browser history, messages with an ex, and pictures. He's embarrassed and wants privacy now, so he's changing passwords again. She's upset because she feels they should trust each other.\n\nSo, the key points here are privacy vs. trust. The author is trying to maintain some personal space, which is a common need. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might feel that sharing passwords is a way to show commitment. But the author is uncomfortable with her invading his privacy, even if there's nothing to hide. \n\nI need to consider if changing passwords is a reasonable action. In relationships, boundaries are important. Even in committed relationships, people often keep some personal devices private. The fact that she went through his messages and found things from the past might have crossed a line for him. He's not hiding anything malicious, just personal history. \n\nThe author isn't doing anything illegal or harmful by changing passwords. It's about setting boundaries. The girlfriend's reaction shows she might not respect those boundaries, but that doesn't make the author wrong for establishing them. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. He's asserting his right to privacy, which is valid. The issue here is more about the girlfriend not respecting those boundaries, not the author for trying to protect them.\n"
