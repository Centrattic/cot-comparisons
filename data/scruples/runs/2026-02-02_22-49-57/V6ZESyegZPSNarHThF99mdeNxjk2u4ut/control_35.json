I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the person in the AITA story is in the wrong for changing their passwords. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe user and their girlfriend moved in together. The girlfriend wanted shared passwords to show trust. The user agreed to give her the password but later changed it to regain privacy. The girlfriend found old, personal stuff and was invading the user's phone. The user now wants to set boundaries by changing passwords, but the girlfriend is upset, saying they should trust each other.\n\nFirst, trust and privacy in a relationship can be tricky. On one hand, sharing passwords might be a gesture of trust, but it also means giving someone access to all your personal data. The user mentioned that there's nothing to hide, but they found it embarrassing when their past was brought up. The girlfriend is reading old messages and looking through the user's phone without permission, which feels intrusive.\n\nI think the key here is consent and boundaries. The user gave the password initially, but the girlfriend is using that access to invade the user's privacy. The user has a right to their own privacy, even in a relationship. Changing the password to prevent unauthorized access isn't about hiding something but about setting a boundary. The girlfriend's actions\u2014reading messages and sifting through old stuff without asking\u2014are the problematic part. So the user is protecting their privacy, which is reasonable. Therefore, the user isn't in the wrong. Answer B."
