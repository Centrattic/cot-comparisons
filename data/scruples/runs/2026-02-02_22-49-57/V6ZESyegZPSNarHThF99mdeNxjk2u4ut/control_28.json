I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and girlfriend moved in together. She wanted to share passwords to show trust. The author gave her the password because he felt there was nothing to hide. Then she accessed his devices and found old stuff like browser history, Skype chats, old photos. He felt embarrassed and changed the passwords. Now she's upset, saying they should trust each other. The author is conflicted.\n\nSo, the key points here: privacy vs. trust. The author is asserting his privacy by changing passwords, while the girlfriend expects trust through shared access.\n\nIn relationships, privacy is important. Everyone has the right to personal space. The fact that the author gave the password initially because he felt there was nothing to hide shows he's willing to be open. However, the girlfriend is using that access to look into old, possibly irrelevant things. \n\nChanging passwords is a way to set boundaries. The author isn't hiding anything new; it's about past content that's not relevant anymore. It's reasonable to want privacy in old messages or photos. The girlfriend's reaction suggests she might be overstepping by going through his private data without permission, even if the password was shared.\n\nBut some might argue that if you give someone your password, you're allowing them access. However, the author might not have anticipated she would go through such old, irrelevant data that doesn't impact their current relationship. There's a difference between checking for security or something important and prying into past conversations that are no longer relevant.\n\nIn terms of being \"in the wrong,\" the author is trying to reclaim his privacy. The girlfriend might feel betrayed by the password change, but the author is justified in wanting to maintain personal boundaries. The issue here is more about mutual respect for privacy and understanding limits. The author isn't doing something inherently wrong by changing passwords to protect his privacy. He's setting a boundary that's necessary for his comfort.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He's asserting his right to privacy in a relationship where the other person is overstepping by looking into old, irrelevant information. The core issue is about respecting each other's boundaries and understanding that privacy doesn't equate to something to hide.\n"
