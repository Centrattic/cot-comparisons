I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. So, the situation is that the guy and his girlfriend moved in together. She wanted to share passwords to show trust, and he agreed to give her his. But then she started looking through his stuff, finding old stuff, and it's making him uncomfortable. Now he's changing his passwords to keep some privacy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend's perspective: she might feel that sharing passwords is a sign of trust, and when he takes them back, she might see it as a betrayal. She might think that once you share something, you don't get to take it back. Also, she's pointing out that trust is important in a relationship, and by removing access, he's creating boundaries that she might not like.\n\nOn the other hand, the guy's side: he's uncomfortable with her going through his personal stuff, even if it's old. He values his privacy and feels that having his own space is important. He might feel that sharing passwords was a mistake because it allowed her to access things he didn't want her to see. Changing the passwords is his way of reasserting his privacy and protecting his personal data.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. In relationships, privacy is a common topic. Some people feel that sharing passwords is okay if both parties agree, but others might see it as an invasion of privacy. The key here is mutual consent. Initially, he gave her the passwords, which she used to access his stuff. Now he's changing them because he's uncomfortable with her actions. \n\nBut the problem is that once you share something, taking it back can be seen as a breach of trust. However, the guy's actions are also about protecting his privacy after realizing that sharing access led to discomfort. The issue is whether maintaining privacy is more important than the trust she feels is necessary.\n\nAnother angle is that if they moved in together, there might be an expectation of shared access to certain things. But that's not a universal rule. People have different boundaries. The fact that she found old stuff and he's embarrassed might indicate that he didn't want those things to be accessible. So, changing passwords could be a reasonable step to protect his privacy.\n\nHowever, the girlfriend might argue that he should have kept those things private instead of sharing them in the first place. But the guy says there's nothing to hide, just things that are now irrelevant. The fact that he's embarrassed suggests that even if there's nothing malicious, he values his privacy here.\n\nIn terms of who's in the wrong: if the guy initially agreed to share passwords and then changed his mind, he might be seen as reneging on an agreement. But if the agreement was that he provided access with the understanding that she wouldn't go through his stuff, and she violated that, then he's justified in taking back control. \n\nBut the original agreement wasn't clear. He gave her the password, but didn't specify that she shouldn't look through certain things. So maybe he's partially at fault for not setting boundaries. However, the fact that she went through his messages and apps without his consent is a privacy violation, which is her fault. \n\nSo, the guy changing passwords is his way of protecting his privacy after her actions made him uncomfortable. Whether he's in the wrong depends on the balance between trust and privacy. If the relationship requires mutual trust, expecting privacy might conflict. But people can have different needs. The key is that both should respect each other's boundaries. \n\nIn conclusion, the guy isn't necessarily in the wrong because he's asserting his need for privacy after experiencing discomfort. The girlfriend's expectation of trust vs. his need for privacy is a common conflict. So, answer B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
