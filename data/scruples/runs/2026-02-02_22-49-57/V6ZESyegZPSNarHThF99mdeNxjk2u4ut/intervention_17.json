I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is about changing passwords to maintain privacy after their girlfriend accessed personal stuff on their devices.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author moved in with their girlfriend and initially shared their password. The girlfriend found some old stuff and started going through messages. The author changed passwords to keep some privacy. The girlfriend is upset, saying they should trust each other.\n\nThe key points here are privacy expectations in a relationship. Even in a committed relationship, people often expect some level of personal privacy. The author isn't hiding anything malicious; they're just uncomfortable with their past being poked into. The girlfriend, on the other hand, sees sharing passwords as trust, which is common in relationships, but maybe overstepped by prying into the past.\n\nThe author's actions are about setting boundaries. They shared the password initially but decided to change it because they felt their privacy was being invaded. The fact that the girlfriend was going through messages without permission might be a bigger issue here. The author isn't doing anything illegal or unethical; they're just reclaiming their personal space.\n\nIn relationships, trust and privacy can sometimes conflict. The author isn't doing anything wrong by protecting their privacy. They're not hiding current issues but old, irrelevant stuff. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from insecurity or misunderstanding. The author's choice to set boundaries is reasonable. So, the answer should be B\u2014author isn't in the wrong.\n"
