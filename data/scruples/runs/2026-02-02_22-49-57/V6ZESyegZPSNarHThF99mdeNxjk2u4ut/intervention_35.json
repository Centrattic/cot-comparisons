I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong after changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend and the author moved in together. She asked for shared passwords to show trust. He agreed, but only gave her his password because he didn't care about her passwords. The problem is that after she had access, she found old stuff like porn in the browser history, old Skype messages, pictures on an old phone, and even went through his messages. He found this invading and decided to change his passwords again for privacy, which upset her.\n\nSo the key points here are mutual trust and privacy. The author gave her access voluntarily, but then felt uncomfortable when she used that access to look through his personal data. His main concern is privacy, even if the content isn't harmful. The girlfriend is upset because she believes in sharing everything as trust.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, trust in a relationship often involves transparency. If you share passwords, you expect the other person to have access. But on the other hand, people have a right to privacy. The author might feel that by sharing passwords, he's allowing access to his devices, but he didn't expect her to actively search through his old data. The fact that she went through his messages without his knowledge is a breach of trust, even if he provided the passwords. \n\nThe author changing passwords to regain privacy makes sense. It's about setting boundaries. Even if he initially agreed to share, he can change his mind if the terms of that sharing are being misused. The issue is that the girlfriend might not see it the same way, thinking that once passwords are shared, she has the right to check what she wants. But the author's discomfort is valid because privacy is a personal matter. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily wrong for wanting to protect his privacy, especially after his partner overstepped. The problem might be more about how they communicated their expectations. If the author had set clear boundaries from the start about what's acceptable when sharing passwords, maybe this wouldn't have happened. But in this case, the author is trying to correct the situation by taking back control of his privacy. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), he's not in the wrong.\n"
