I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong.\n\nSo the situation is that the guy and his girlfriend moved in together. She wanted shared passwords as a trust thing. He gave her his password because he said there's nothing to hide. But then she started going through his stuff\u2014like old browser history, messages, photos, and even his phone when he wasn't looking. He changed the passwords to protect his privacy, and she's upset, saying it's about trust. Now he's wondering if he did the wrong thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend's perspective is that sharing passwords is part of trust in a relationship. She might feel that by changing passwords, he's being secretive or not fully trusting her. But on the other hand, the guy is asserting his right to privacy. Even if there's nothing to hide, personal conversations and old data from the past can be sensitive. The fact that she went through his phone without permission might be the bigger issue here. \n\nThe key points are consent and boundaries. He agreed to share the password initially, but she crossed a line by accessing his private information without his knowledge. Changing the password to prevent that isn't about hiding things but about protecting his own privacy. It's reasonable for him to set boundaries, especially if he feels his privacy is being invaded. The girlfriend needs to respect that, even if she feels it's a lack of trust. Trust doesn't mean giving up all privacy; it's about mutual respect. So the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to maintain his privacy after her actions. The real problem here might be her behavior, not his response to it. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
