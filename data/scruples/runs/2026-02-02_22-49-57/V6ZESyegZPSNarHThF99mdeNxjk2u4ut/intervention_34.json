I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author moved in with their girlfriend and initially gave her their passwords, saying there's nothing to hide. But after the girlfriend found some old stuff like browser history, ex messages, and photos, the author decided to change their passwords to regain privacy. The girlfriend is upset, arguing that they should trust each other.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author gave the password willingly at first, which shows a willingness to trust. However, the girlfriend's actions\u2014going through old messages, finding personal data\u2014might have made the author uncomfortable. The key here is the concept of boundaries and consent. Even in a relationship, individuals have a right to privacy. The girlfriend accessed personal information without the author's consent, which is a red flag. Trust is mutual, but trust shouldn't mean allowing someone to invade your privacy without boundaries.\n\nThe author's decision to change passwords isn't about hiding something new but about setting a boundary after their privacy was invaded. The fact that the author felt the need to change passwords after the girlfriend's actions suggests that the initial trust was breached. The girlfriend's expectation of continued access without consent isn't respectful of the author's need for privacy.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're asserting their right to privacy after their trust was violated. The real issue here is the girlfriend's behavior, not the author's response to it. Therefore, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
