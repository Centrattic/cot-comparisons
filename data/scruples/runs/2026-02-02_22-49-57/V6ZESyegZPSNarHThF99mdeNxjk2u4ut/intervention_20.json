I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices.\n\nFirst, the key points from the scenario: The couple moved in together, the girlfriend wanted shared passwords to show trust. The author initially gave her the password, explaining there's nothing to hide. However, the girlfriend found old, personal information in the browser history, old conversations, and went through his messages. The author then decides to change passwords to maintain privacy, which upsets the girlfriend.\n\nNow, considering privacy and trust in a relationship. The author's actions are about asserting personal boundaries. Even though the girlfriend wanted transparency, the author has a right to privacy. The fact that the girlfriend went through private data without consent is a breach of trust. The author isn't hiding anything but feels uncomfortable with their past being accessed. Changing passwords is a reasonable step to protect privacy, especially after the girlfriend's actions have made the author feel invaded.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's perspective is about trust and shared access. But trust shouldn't mean unlimited access to each other's personal data, especially if it causes discomfort. The author's right to set boundaries isn't wrong. It's about mutual respect and understanding. The girlfriend's actions of invading privacy, regardless of intent, are problematic. The author's response is about reclaiming control over their personal space, which is justified.\n\nSo, the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong. They have the right to privacy and to set boundaries in the relationship.\n"
