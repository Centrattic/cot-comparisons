I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. \n\nFirst, the situation: The couple moved in together. The girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a trust gesture. The author initially resisted, only giving up their password. Then the girl found old, personal stuff and went through his messages. The author feels embarrassed and changes the passwords again, leading the girl to be upset.\n\nSo, the key points here are privacy vs. trust. The author is setting boundaries to protect their privacy, which is a valid right. Even though they initially shared the password, the author's discomfort with the girl sifting through personal data is understandable. The girl's actions, like checking messages and old files, might be seen as invasive. The author changing passwords is a way to reestablish personal space, which isn't inherently wrong. \n\nBut the girl views it as a breach of trust. However, trust shouldn't require someone to have full access to all personal data without boundaries. Healthy relationships involve mutual respect for each other's privacy. The author isn't hiding anything malicious; they just want to avoid embarrassment and maintain some personal space. \n\nThe girlfriend's behavior seems to cross a line by actively searching through the author's private data, which could indicate insecurity or lack of respect for boundaries. The author's response is a reasonable attempt to reclaim privacy without lying or hiding something new. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong for wanting to protect their personal information, even if they shared it before. Changing passwords is a legitimate action to maintain privacy in a relationship where boundaries are being tested.\n"
