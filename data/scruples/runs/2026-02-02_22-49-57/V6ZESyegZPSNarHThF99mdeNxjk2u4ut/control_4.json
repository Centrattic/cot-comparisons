I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The couple moved in together, the girlfriend wanted shared passwords to show trust. The author agreed to give her their password, but now she's going through his history, messages, etc., which he finds embarrassing. He changed the passwords to regain privacy, and she's upset because she thinks they should trust each other.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent, privacy, and boundaries. The author initially gave her the password, which allowed her access. But when she started going through his personal data, he felt it was overstepping. He changed the passwords to set boundaries. \n\nFrom a privacy standpoint, even if you're in a relationship, people have a right to their own privacy. The girlfriend's actions of going through his messages and history without explicit permission might be considered invasive. The author is trying to protect their personal space, which is reasonable. \n\nThe girlfriend's expectation of access might stem from wanting transparency, but that doesn't mean the author is obligated to grant it. Trust is mutual, but it shouldn't require sacrificing one's privacy. The fact that the author is uncomfortable with her going through old messages and files shows that there's a boundary issue on her part. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could have communicated their discomfort earlier instead of waiting until after sharing the password. However, once the invasion of privacy occurred, changing the passwords is a reasonable response to prevent further breaches. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to protect their privacy. The girlfriend might be overstepping by accessing his personal data without consent, even if she had the password. Therefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
