I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for changing their passwords to keep their girlfriend from accessing their devices. \n\nFirst, the situation: The couple moved in together. The girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a sign of trust. The author gave her access initially but then changed passwords after she went through his stuff, found old stuff, and invaded his privacy. Now he's cutting off access to protect his privacy.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are trust and privacy. The girlfriend is pushing for transparency, which she sees as trust. The author is setting boundaries to maintain privacy. But is that wrong?\n\nOn one hand, sharing passwords can be a way to show trust. But that's usually mutual. The author gave her access but she didn't respect his privacy, looking through messages and old files. That's a privacy violation. The author is reacting by taking back control of his devices, which is about maintaining personal boundaries.\n\nBut relationships require trust. If he's hiding things now, does that show a lack of trust? But he's not hiding secrets; he's protecting his past, which he's already explained is irrelevant. The problem is her accessing without permission, not the content itself. \n\nThe author is justified in wanting privacy, especially if she's overstepping. Changing passwords is a reasonable response to prevent further invasions. It's about setting healthy boundaries. So, he's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
