I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the writer changing their passwords after their girlfriend accessed their devices and found old, personal stuff.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend wanted to share passwords as a sign of trust. The author agreed to give her the password initially because there's \"nothing to hide,\" but now he's changing it after she went through his stuff. He feels privacy is important, even in a relationship. She's upset because she believes trust means sharing access.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, setting boundaries is a valid right. Privacy is important for everyone, and even if there's nothing to hide, personal space matters. The fact that she went through his messages without his consent might be a key point. That action could be seen as a breach of trust, even if he gave her the password. He might feel that she overstepped by prying into personal conversations and data.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's actions might stem from wanting to be fully transparent and trusting. She might argue that if he's open about everything, there's no issue. However, her actions of searching through his messages without asking could be problematic. Trust shouldn't require someone to have unrestricted access to private areas.\n\nThe author changing the password is a way to reclaim his privacy. It's a reasonable response to protect his personal information, especially after feeling that his boundaries were crossed. He's not hiding anything malicious, just personal history that's irrelevant now. \n\nIn relationships, mutual respect for privacy and boundaries is crucial. The girlfriend might need to understand that even in a trusting relationship, individuals should have their own space. The author isn't being dishonest; he's just reasserting his right to privacy after feeling uncomfortable with the intrusions.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. He's taking a stand for his privacy after his boundaries were violated. The girlfriend's actions were the initial issue, so the author is justified in changing the passwords.\n"
