I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple moving in together and the girlfriend wanting to share passwords as a sign of trust. The author gave his password initially but then changed it after she found some past stuff and went through his messages.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The girlfriend's argument is about trust and transparency, which is a common expectation in relationships. She might feel that access to each other's devices shows commitment. On the other hand, the author is asserting his privacy, especially after feeling that his personal data is being snooped through without consent. \n\nThe key points here are consent and boundaries. The author initially agreed to share the password, but after instances where he felt his privacy was invaded (like her going through his messages), he decided to change it. This could be seen as a reasonable step to protect his personal space. However, the girlfriend might view this as a breach of trust. \n\nBut in relationships, it's important to have mutual respect for each other's boundaries. If the girlfriend felt the need to access his private data without his consent, that's a red flag. The author changing passwords could be a way to set a boundary, which is his right. \n\nSo, considering the situation, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's protecting his privacy after feeling that his trust was violated. The girlfriend's actions of snooping are problematic. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
