I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The scenario is about a girlfriend moving in together and wanting to share passwords as a trust thing. The author gave her the password at first but now changed it because the girlfriend was going through his stuff and found old, embarrassing content.\n\nSo, the first thing I need to consider is the concept of privacy in relationships. Even in a committed relationship, people often expect some personal space. The author is setting boundaries by changing passwords, which is a common way to maintain privacy. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might feel that sharing passwords is a sign of trust. But there's a balance here. Trust doesn't mean you have to give someone unrestricted access to your personal data, especially if it's causing discomfort.\n\nThe girlfriend's actions, like going through his messages and apps, seem invasive. The author is justified in feeling that his privacy is being invaded. The fact that she's using found content to question him about it shows she's not respecting his boundaries. The author's response is to set a clear boundary by changing the passwords. This is his way of protecting his personal information, even if there's nothing to hide. The embarrassment from old conversations and pictures is a valid reason to seek privacy.\n\nHowever, some might argue that in a trusting relationship, both partners should be open with each other. But trust doesn't mean complete transparency. People have the right to keep certain things private, especially if they're not relevant to the current relationship. The author isn't hiding anything new or harmful; it's just old data from the past. The girlfriend's reaction to the password change could indicate she doesn't understand or respect his need for privacy, which is a problem in the relationship dynamics.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The author did communicate his reasons for changing the passwords, explaining it's about privacy, not secrecy. If the girlfriend is upset, it might be more about her expectations not aligning with his. The key here is mutual respect. The author isn't doing anything unethical or wrong by maintaining his privacy. He's not hiding anything that affects the relationship. The issue is more about differing views on privacy and how to handle it in a relationship.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong. He's asserting his right to privacy, which is reasonable. The problem lies more with the girlfriend's actions and her expectations regarding trust and access. The correct answer should be B.\n"
