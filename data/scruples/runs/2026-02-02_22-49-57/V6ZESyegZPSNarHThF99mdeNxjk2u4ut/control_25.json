I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: The couple moved in together, and the girlfriend wanted to share passwords as a sign of trust. The author initially gave her the password but later changed it after she found some personal stuff, like old browser history, ex messages, and went through his messages. The author now wants privacy, so he's changing passwords again, and the girlfriend is upset, saying they should trust each other.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's think about privacy versus trust. The author gave the password initially but felt uncomfortable when the girlfriend accessed personal information. The key here is that the author felt his privacy was being invaded even though there's nothing harmful. \n\nIn relationships, mutual respect for privacy is important. Trust shouldn't mean one person has to give up all privacy. The girlfriend might see password sharing as a gesture of trust, but the author is asserting his right to personal space. The fact that he explained the situation and changed passwords for privacy, not to hide something, suggests it's more about boundaries than deceit.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel betrayed by changing passwords, interpreting it as a lack of trust. But the author's actions are about protecting personal history, which might be sensitive but not necessarily something to hide. The issue is about setting healthy boundaries.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author isn't in the wrong. He's managing his privacy while in a relationship, which is reasonable. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
