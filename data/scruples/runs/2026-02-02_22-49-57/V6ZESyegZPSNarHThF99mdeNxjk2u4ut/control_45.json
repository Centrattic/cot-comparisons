I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for changing their passwords so their girlfriend can't access their devices anymore. The situation is that they moved in together, and the girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a sign of trust. The author initially gave her the password but now changed it after she went through his stuff, found old stuff, and invaded his privacy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's main point is about maintaining privacy. They mention that they don't hide anything but feel their privacy is being invaded when the girlfriend looks through their old messages, history, etc. The girlfriend, on the other hand, sees sharing passwords as a sign of trust and is upset that he changed it back.\n\nIn relationships, boundaries are important. Trust is key, but so is respecting individual privacy. The author gave the password once but then felt uncomfortable with the access, so they changed it. The girlfriend is taking it as a breach of trust, which is a common issue in relationships. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they have a right to their privacy. The problem seems to stem from differing expectations about privacy versus trust. The girlfriend might not realize that even if there's nothing to hide, the act of sharing passwords can lead to discomfort if the other person looks through personal data. The author's actions are about setting a boundary after feeling that their privacy was overstepped. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's actions\u2014going through his messages and apps without permission\u2014seem to be the main issue here. The author changed the passwords to prevent further intrusion, which is a reasonable response to protect their privacy. So, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
