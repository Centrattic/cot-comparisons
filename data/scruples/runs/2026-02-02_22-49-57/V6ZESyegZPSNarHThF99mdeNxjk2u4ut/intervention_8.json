I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who changed their passwords after their girlfriend accessed his private data is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple moving in together, sharing passwords, and then the girlfriend looking through his phone and computer when he changed his passwords.\n\nFirst, the user provided the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post. The main points are that the girlfriend wanted shared passwords to show trust. The author initially gave her the password because he had nothing to hide. However, the girlfriend found old, embarrassing stuff from his past, like browser history, old messages, and photos. She also was found going through his messages. The author now wants to change passwords to maintain privacy, but the girlfriend is upset and says they should trust each other.\n\nThe user thinks the author is in the wrong but is curious for my opinion. They want the answer in A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nSo, I need to analyze whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The key issue is privacy versus trust in a relationship. The girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a gesture of trust, which is common in some relationships. However, the author felt the need to set boundaries when his privacy was invaded. \n\nThe girlfriend accessed his private data without permission, even after he had given her the password. The fact that she went through his messages and found stuff that was personal and from the past might be seen as overstepping. The author felt uncomfortable and decided to take back his privacy by changing passwords. \n\nFrom a relational perspective, trust is important, but so is mutual respect for each other's boundaries. If the author is uncomfortable with the level of access, changing the passwords is a way to set a boundary. The girlfriend's reaction suggests she feels betrayed, but the author's action is about reclaiming privacy. \n\nIn many relationships, it's a balance. Some people might argue that once you share a password, it's an agreement to have access. However, if that access is being used in a way that invades privacy without consent, then the person has the right to withdraw that access. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. He's setting a boundary to protect his privacy. The girlfriend might need to respect that. The real issue is the lack of communication and understanding between them. The author's action is a reasonable step to maintain his privacy after feeling that his trust was violated. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
