I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for changing their passwords to keep their girlfriend from accessing their devices. Let's see.\n\nFirst, the situation: They moved in together, the girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a sign of trust. The author agreed to give her their password but now feels that she's going through their personal stuff\u2014like old browser history, messages, and a packed-away phone. The author changed the passwords to regain privacy, and the girlfriend is upset, saying they should trust each other.\n\nSo, the main points here are about boundaries and privacy in a relationship. The author felt they had to set boundaries when they saw their privacy being invaded, even though they initially agreed to share passwords. The girlfriend's actions (looking through messages, finding old stuff) made the author uncomfortable, leading them to take action.\n\nIn relationships, trust is important, but so is mutual respect for each other's privacy. Just because someone shares passwords doesn't mean they're okay with someone rummaging through their personal data. The author's action was a way to protect their privacy after experiencing breaches. The girlfriend's expectation of full access might be unreasonable if it's causing discomfort. The key here is that the author is setting a boundary to maintain their personal space, which is a healthy thing in a relationship. The girlfriend might need to understand that privacy can coexist with trust. So, the author isn't in the wrong for doing this.\n"
