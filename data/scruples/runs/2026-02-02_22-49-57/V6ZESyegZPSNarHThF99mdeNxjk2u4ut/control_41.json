I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple moved in together. The girlfriend wanted to share passwords as a trust gesture. The author gave her the password but later changed it after she found some personal stuff like browser history, old messages, and images. The girlfriend is upset because the author is now limiting access, and she argues that trust is important. The author feels they need privacy.\n\nSo, the key points here are consent and boundaries. The author initially gave a password but then changed it after feeling their privacy was invaded. The girlfriend's actions of going through his devices could be seen as a breach of trust if he didn't explicitly consent to her accessing his devices. The author has the right to their privacy, even in a relationship. However, the girlfriend might feel that the initial agreement was mutual sharing, so the author changing passwords might seem like a betrayal.\n\nBut from the author's perspective, after experiencing the invasion of privacy, they felt the need to set boundaries. The fact that he gave the password initially doesn't obligate him to allow ongoing access if he's uncomfortable. Privacy is a personal right, and relationships should respect that unless both parties agree otherwise. The girlfriend's actions of going through his messages without his knowledge (assuming he didn't give ongoing consent) could be the issue here.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault. Since the author changed the passwords to protect their privacy after the girlfriend overstepped, the author might not be in the wrong. The problem might lie more with the girlfriend's actions rather than the author's decision to set boundaries. However, communication is a big part of relationships. If the author didn't discuss their discomfort earlier, that could be a point of contention. But given the scenario, the author is acting to reclaim their privacy, which is a reasonable action. Therefore, the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
