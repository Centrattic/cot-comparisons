I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for changing their passwords. The situation is that the girlfriend wanted shared access to their devices to show trust, but when she did look through his stuff, he found it embarrassing. Now he's changing the passwords again.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend initiated the idea of sharing passwords as a sign of trust. The author agreed to give her his password but then later changed his mind because she was going through his personal data. He explains that it's not about hiding things but wanting some privacy. The key points are mutual trust, privacy boundaries, and how each person interprets what's acceptable.\n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. The girlfriend might feel that not allowing her full access is a breach of trust. On the other hand, the author is asserting his right to personal privacy. The fact that he initially gave her the password shows a willingness to be open, but when it led to discomfort, he adjusted his approach. \n\nIt's important to note that the author isn't hiding anything malicious; it's past conversations and photos that are now irrelevant. The issue is about personal space. Many people might agree that even in a trusting relationship, some level of privacy is necessary. The girlfriend's actions of going through his messages without consent might be the bigger issue here.\n\nThe author's decision to set boundaries by changing passwords could be seen as reasonable. He's not in the wrong for wanting to protect his privacy, especially after she overstepped by invading it. The girlfriend needs to respect his boundaries. So, the answer is B.\n"
