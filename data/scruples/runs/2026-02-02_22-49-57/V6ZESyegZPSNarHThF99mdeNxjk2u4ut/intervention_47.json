I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for changing passwords to keep their girlfriend from accessing their devices. Let me start by understanding the scenario.\n\nThe author and their girlfriend moved in together. She wanted to share passwords to show trust. The author agreed to give her their password, but in return, the author expected the same privacy. However, the girlfriend went through his stuff, found old stuff like porn history, old conversations, and even looked at his phone when he wasn't around. The author now wants to change the passwords to regain some privacy, which made the girlfriend upset. The author is questioning if they're in the wrong for doing so.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are about boundaries, trust, and privacy. The girlfriend wanted shared passwords, maybe expecting full transparency. But the author feels that having their privacy invaded is why they're changing passwords. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the concept of privacy in relationships. Even in committed relationships, individuals often expect some level of personal privacy. Sharing passwords can be a big deal because it grants access to personal data. The girlfriend might see it as a breach of trust if the author changes the passwords, thinking that once trust is given, it's supposed to be mutual and ongoing. However, the author might feel that their privacy is being invaded, especially when the girlfriend is snooping through old messages and personal history without consent. \n\nThe girlfriend's actions\u2014going through his phone, reading messages, etc.\u2014could be seen as a violation of the trust the author had in allowing her access. If the author gave the password with the expectation that it would be respected, then the girlfriend overstepped by intruding into personal data. In that case, the author changing the passwords to prevent further intrusion is a reasonable response to protect their privacy and set boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, if the agreement was mutual and the author gave the password expecting reciprocal trust, then changing the passwords might seem like a withdrawal of trust. But the girlfriend's actions have already broken that trust, so the author is actually reestablishing their own boundaries. \n\nI think the main issue here is the balance between shared trust and individual privacy. The author isn't wrong for wanting to protect their personal space, especially after their privacy was invaded. The girlfriend's expectation of ongoing access without respecting the author's privacy might be the real problem here. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They are taking steps to maintain their privacy after the trust was breached.\n"
