I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend and girlfriend moved in together. The girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a sign of trust. The author agreed and gave her the passwords. However, the girlfriend started finding old, personal stuff like browser history, old conversations, and even went through his phone. The author is uncomfortable with this invasion of privacy and decided to change the passwords, leading to conflict.\n\nSo, the key points are: mutual agreement to share passwords initially, but then the girlfriend accessed personal information without consent. The author feels the need to protect their privacy, hence changing passwords. The girlfriend feels betrayed because they were supposed to trust each other.\n\nNow, considering privacy rights. Even in a relationship, people generally expect privacy regarding their personal devices unless there's a mutual agreement to share. The author might have given the passwords with the assumption that the girlfriend would respect their boundaries. However, the girlfriend is prying into past conversations and data that the author no longer finds relevant. \n\nThe author's actions in changing passwords could be seen as reclaiming personal privacy. The girlfriend's actions might be considered overstepping, as she's accessing information without current consent, even if it's old. The author isn't hiding anything malicious but wants to prevent embarrassment and maintain personal space.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that once passwords are shared, the device is open for access. But the author might have expected that shared access wouldn't involve going through private data without a reason. The context is important here: the author gave the password but didn't anticipate the level of intrusion. Changing the password to set boundaries isn't inherently wrong.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're asserting their right to privacy. The girlfriend might need to respect that. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
