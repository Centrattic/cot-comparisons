I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is at fault for changing their passwords to keep their girlfriend from accessing their devices. Let me break this down.\n\nThe situation is that the couple moved in together. The girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a trust gesture. The guy gave her his password, saying there's nothing to hide. But then she started looking through his stuff\u2014browser history, old messages, his phone. He found this intrusive and now wants to change his passwords to reclaim some privacy. She's upset because she thinks they should trust each other.\n\nSo, the main question is about whether he's in the wrong for changing passwords. The key points here are privacy vs. trust in a relationship. The guy isn't hiding anything malicious; it's more about personal boundaries. He's not doing anything illegal or unethical by securing his devices. The girlfriend's actions might be a breach of his privacy even though he initially gave her the password. But maybe he gave it with the expectation that she wouldn't snoop? Or maybe she thought shared passwords meant mutual access. \n\nIn relationships, trust is important, but so is respecting personal space. If he's uncomfortable with her going through his past data, even if it's harmless, he has the right to set boundaries. The fact that she's invading his privacy by checking his messages without a clear reason might justify him wanting to change passwords. However, the argument is that sharing passwords is a gesture of trust, so changing them could seem like breaking that trust. \n\nBut the guy isn't hiding anything new; he's just protecting old, irrelevant stuff. The girlfriend's actions might be controlling or a lack of trust in him. So, the answer depends on whether the act of changing passwords is seen as the guy being untrustworthy or him asserting his right to privacy. Given that he's not doing anything wrong and is reclaiming his privacy after her intrusion, the answer is probably B\u2014No, he's not in the wrong.\n"
