I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down the situation here. The user is asking if the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The main issue is about privacy versus trust in a relationship.\n\nFirst, the author moved in with their girlfriend and initially shared their password to show trust. The girlfriend then accessed personal information like browser history, old messages, and photos of exes. The author found this intrusive and decided to change passwords to regain privacy. The girlfriend is upset, arguing that trust means not having secrets.\n\nSo, the key points are: mutual sharing was expected, but the author felt their privacy was invaded. The question is whether setting boundaries by changing passwords is wrong. \n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial, but so is respecting individual privacy. The author isn't hiding anything malicious but wants personal space. The girlfriend's actions might be overstepping, as snooping without consent can be a red flag. The author's response is about protecting their own privacy, which is a reasonable boundary. \n\nSome might argue that if you share passwords, you're inviting access. However, the context shows the author shared despite reservations, and the girlfriend went beyond just using the password to check something\u2014she was actively going through private conversations. That's a breach of trust, so the author's action to secure their accounts is justified. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong for setting these boundaries. The answer should be B.\n"
