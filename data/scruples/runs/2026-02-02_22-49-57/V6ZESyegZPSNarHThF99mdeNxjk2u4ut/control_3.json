I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The situation is that the girlfriend wanted to share passwords to show trust, but the author changed them again after she went through his stuff. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend initiated the idea of sharing passwords. The author gave her the password initially but then changed it after she invaded his privacy by looking through his messages and old data. The key points here are consent, trust, and privacy. \n\nThe author felt the need to set boundaries when their privacy was breached. Even though he had given the password at first, the girlfriend's actions crossed into personal territory. The author's decision to change the passwords is about reclaiming their personal space. \n\nTrust is mutual, but the girlfriend didn't respect the author's privacy, which is a two-way street. The author isn't hiding anything; they just want some privacy. The girlfriend's argument about trust doesn't hold because trust doesn't require full access to someone's private digital life without boundaries.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're standing up for their privacy after being invaded. The answer should be B.\n"
