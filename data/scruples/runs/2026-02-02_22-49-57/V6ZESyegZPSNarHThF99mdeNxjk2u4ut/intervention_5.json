I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple moved in together, and the girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a sign of trust. The author gave her the password, but the girlfriend kept going through his old data, which made him uncomfortable. Now he's changing the passwords again for privacy.\n\nThe key points here are about trust and boundaries. The author initially shared the password, trusting that the girlfriend wouldn't invade his privacy. However, the girlfriend found old, irrelevant stuff and started looking through his messages. The author feels embarrassed and wants privacy, so he changes the passwords again. The girlfriend is upset because she sees this as a lack of trust.\n\nI think the main issue is mutual respect and setting boundaries. Sharing passwords can be a sign of trust, but if one party starts invading the other's privacy, that's a problem. The author has the right to his own privacy, even in a relationship. The girlfriend might be overstepping by going through his devices without permission, even if she thought she had access.\n\nOn the other hand, the author initially gave her the password, which might imply consent. But the girlfriend's actions went beyond just having the password; she actively searched through personal data. The author is reclaiming his privacy, which is reasonable.\n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. He's protecting his personal space, which is important in any relationship. The girlfriend needs to respect his boundaries. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
