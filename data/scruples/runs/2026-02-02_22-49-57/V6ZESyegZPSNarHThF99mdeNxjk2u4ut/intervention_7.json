I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They moved in together. The girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a sign of trust. The author initially resisted but gave her the password because there's nothing to hide. However, the girlfriend found old stuff like porn history, old messages, and photos. She also was snooping through his messages. Now, the author changed the passwords to regain privacy, and the girlfriend is upset, arguing that trust should mean sharing.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to decide if that's the case. So, what's the key here? Privacy vs. trust. The author gave the password once but now feels that their privacy is being invaded. The girlfriend is using the access to look through things that are in the past and irrelevant now. The author is trying to set boundaries, which is reasonable. People have a right to privacy even in relationships. The girlfriend's actions, like looking through messages and old data, could be seen as overstepping. The author changing passwords isn't about hiding something new but reclaiming personal space. Trust is important, but mutual respect for boundaries is also crucial. The girlfriend's reaction seems to be about control or lack of understanding about privacy. The author isn't being dishonest by changing passwords; they're protecting their personal information. So, the answer is likely B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
