I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for changing passwords to keep their girlfriend from accessing their devices. The situation is that they moved in together, and the girlfriend wanted shared passwords to show trust. The author gave her the password but then felt uncomfortable when she went through his old data and messages.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend's perspective is that sharing passwords is a sign of trust, and she felt that by having access, she's being included. But the author feels that even though there's nothing to hide, the privacy of past conversations and data is important. The key point here is mutual respect for boundaries. \n\nThe author initially gave the password but later changed it because they felt their privacy was being invaded. The girlfriend is upset because she thinks trust is about openness. However, trust in a relationship also involves respecting each other's personal space. The author isn't hiding anything malicious; they just want some privacy regarding old, irrelevant content. \n\nNow, the question is whether changing passwords is justified. In many relationships, people might share some passwords, but it's not a one-size-fits-all situation. The author isn't keeping secrets that affect the relationship now. The old messages and photos are from the past and don't harm the current relationship. Therefore, the author's action to set boundaries by changing passwords isn't necessarily wrong. It's about maintaining a balance between trust and privacy. \n\nThe girlfriend might need to understand that privacy doesn't always equate to distrust. The author's discomfort with being caught going through her stuff (like messages) shows they also value her privacy, even if they didn't ask for her passwords. So the author is not in the wrong for asserting their need for privacy after feeling their boundaries were crossed.\n"
