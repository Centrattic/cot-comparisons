I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is at fault for changing their passwords. They moved in together, the girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a trust thing. The author gave her the password, but then the girlfriend went through his stuff, found old stuff, which embarrassed him. So he changed the passwords.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are about privacy versus trust. The author allowed sharing initially but now wants privacy back. The girlfriend feels that since they're in a relationship, there should be no secrets. But the author is uncomfortable with her accessing personal data from the past, even if it's not relevant now.\n\nIn relationships, trust is important, but so is personal privacy. The author isn't hiding anything malicious, just old personal stuff. Changing passwords to prevent unauthorized access isn't about hiding something, but about setting boundaries. The girlfriend is upset because she feels the author is being secretive, but maybe she overstepped by going through his things without asking.\n\nI think the author is justified in wanting to maintain some privacy. People have a right to personal space, even in a relationship. The girlfriend's actions of snooping through messages and apps without permission might be the real issue here. The author changing passwords is a reasonable response to protect his privacy. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
