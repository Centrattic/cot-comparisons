I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author and their girlfriend moved in together. The girlfriend wanted to share passwords to show trust. The author gave her the password but later changed it when they noticed the girlfriend was going through their personal stuff, like old messages, browser history, and old phone data. The author now wants to set boundaries for privacy, but the girlfriend is upset, arguing it's about trust.\n\nSo the key points here are consent, privacy, and mutual respect. The author gave the password initially, but the girlfriend used it to access private information without permission. The author feels entitled to change the passwords to protect their privacy, even in a relationship. \n\nIn relationships, trust is important, but that doesn't mean one person has the right to invade the other's privacy. Everyone has the right to personal boundaries. The girlfriend's actions seem to cross that boundary by accessing the author's devices without asking each time. The author changing the passwords is a way to reclaim their privacy and set limits. \n\nI should consider if there's any cultural or ethical aspect where sharing passwords is expected in a relationship. But generally, unless there's a legal requirement or an agreement, individuals should have control over their own devices and data. The fact that the author felt the need to change passwords after the invasion of privacy suggests they were respecting the girlfriend's wishes initially but now need to protect their own space.\n\nThe girlfriend's argument about trust is valid, but trust should work both ways. Trust doesn't mean allowing someone to access your private information without consent. The author is asserting their right to privacy, which is reasonable. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for setting these boundaries. The answer should be B.\n"
