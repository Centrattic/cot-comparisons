I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author did something wrong by changing their passwords after their girlfriend had been going through their stuff. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend asked for shared passwords as a show of trust. The author agreed to share but then noticed that she was going through his private stuff. He found this intrusive and changed the passwords to regain some privacy. Now he's being called out for not trusting her.\n\nHmm. Trust is important in a relationship, but so is personal privacy. The author isn't hiding anything malicious; he's just uncomfortable with his past being pried into. The girlfriend seems to believe that trust means full access, but the author might have boundaries. \n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and boundaries. If both parties agreed to share passwords, but one side is overstepping by going through private data without consent, that's a problem. The author is trying to protect his privacy, which is a reasonable action. \n\nI think the author is justified in changing the passwords. Everyone has a right to some level of privacy, even in a committed relationship. The girlfriend's actions cross into invasion of privacy, so the author's response is a way to set those boundaries. So the answer should be B.\n"
