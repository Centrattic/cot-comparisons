I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about changing passwords to maintain privacy after the girlfriend started looking through his stuff even though she had the passwords. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend wanted to share passwords as a sign of trust. The author gave her the password but set boundaries by not asking for hers. Then, after she found some personal stuff from his past and snooped through his messages, he decided to change the passwords to regain his privacy.\n\nSo, the main issue here is about boundaries in a relationship. The author feels that his privacy is being invaded when she goes through his stuff. Even though he gave her the password, he's not comfortable with her accessing his personal information without his permission. Changing the passwords is his way of setting a boundary. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that since they shared passwords, it's a mutual agreement. But the author didn't ask for her password, so the dynamic might be one-sided. The key point is that the author is not hiding anything but still wants privacy. The fact that she's going through his personal data without asking could be seen as a breach of trust from his side.\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect for each other's privacy is important. The author is taking steps to protect his personal space, which is a reasonable action. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from feeling excluded, but the author has the right to his own privacy. \n\nSo, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong because he's asserting his need for privacy after experiencing intrusion.\n"
