I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend wanted to share passwords as a gesture of trust. The author agreed to give her their password but later changed it when he noticed she was looking through his stuff, like old messages and photos. The girlfriend is upset because she feels this is a breach of trust. The author feels he's entitled to some privacy.\n\nSo, the main issue here is about boundaries in a relationship. Trust is important, but so is personal privacy. The author might feel that even though he shared his password initially, he has the right to revoke access if he's uncomfortable. On the other hand, the girlfriend might see the password sharing as a mutual agreement, expecting ongoing access.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author probably didn't handle the password change smoothly. He should have discussed his concerns earlier instead of just changing the passwords. However, the act of changing passwords to maintain privacy isn't inherently wrong. People have different comfort levels with sharing personal information, and it's reasonable to adjust boundaries if those boundaries are being overstepped.\n\nThe girlfriend's actions of searching through his devices might be the real issue here. If she was invading his privacy, then the author is justified in protecting his own. But if the password sharing was mutual and she expected reciprocal access, he might be seen as breaking that trust. However, the fact that he found her going through his things suggests that his privacy was being violated, which gives him a valid reason to set boundaries.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to protect his privacy, especially after his boundaries were crossed. He should have communicated his reasons better, but the action itself is about setting a necessary boundary. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
