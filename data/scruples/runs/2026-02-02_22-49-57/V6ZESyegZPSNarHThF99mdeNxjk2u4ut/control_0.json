I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The situation involves a girlfriend wanting access to shared devices for trust, but the individual changed passwords after she went through his personal data.\n\nFirst, consider the initial agreement. The user gave her the password, which he felt was unnecessary since he had nothing to hide. But then she started going through his old stuff, which made him uncomfortable. He wants privacy and is changing the passwords now. \n\nThe key points here are trust and boundaries. In relationships, trust is important, but so is personal space. The user isn't hiding anything; he's just setting boundaries after feeling his privacy was invaded. The girlfriend expects trust, but the user's actions are about maintaining his own privacy. \n\nThe user's actions could be seen as reasonable because everyone has a right to privacy, even in a relationship. However, the girlfriend might feel betrayed by changing the passwords, thinking it breaks the trust she expected. \n\nBut the question is whether the user is in the wrong. Since he's responding to her actions (going through his messages) and wants to protect his personal data, it's about self-respect and boundaries. The fact that he's not hiding anything but still wants privacy is a valid reason. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that once you share passwords, you expect the other person to have access. But the user only shared one password and specified that he didn't want hers. The girlfriend's actions went beyond just accessing; she was prying into old messages and data, which the user found intrusive.\n\nSo, the user's decision to change passwords is a way to set boundaries after feeling invaded. His actions aren't malicious; they're about protecting his personal space. Therefore, he's not in the wrong here.\n"
