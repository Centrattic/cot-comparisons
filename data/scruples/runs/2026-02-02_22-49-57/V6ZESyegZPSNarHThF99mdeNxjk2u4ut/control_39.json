I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The couple moved in together, and the girlfriend wanted to share passwords as a sign of trust. The author agreed to give her the passwords but made it clear they didn't need hers. Then, the girlfriend found old stuff like porn in the browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex, pictures from an old phone, and she went through his messages. The author is now changing passwords again to maintain privacy, which upset the girlfriend.\n\nThe main question is about whether the author is wrong for changing the passwords. The key points here are privacy, trust, and mutual respect in the relationship. \n\nThe author initially gave the passwords, which the girlfriend used to access his devices. But he found it uncomfortable when she went through his old stuff, which he considered personal. Changing the passwords is his way of maintaining some privacy, even though he's in a relationship. \n\nOn one hand, the girlfriend feels that sharing passwords is about trust, so if you don't want her to have access, maybe that's a breach of trust. But on the other hand, everyone has a right to some level of privacy, even in a relationship. The author isn't hiding anything malicious; it's just old, irrelevant stuff that's causing embarrassment. \n\nThe girlfriend is overstepping by going through his messages and looking at his devices. The author is asserting his boundaries, which is important. If the girlfriend is upset because she feels trusted, but the author's privacy is being invaded, the balance here is tricky. \n\nIn relationships, mutual respect for each other's boundaries is crucial. The author isn't doing anything illegal or harmful; he's setting a boundary. The girlfriend might need to accept that some privacy is necessary, even between partners. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong. Changing passwords to protect one's privacy is a reasonable action when the other person is crossing boundaries.\n"
