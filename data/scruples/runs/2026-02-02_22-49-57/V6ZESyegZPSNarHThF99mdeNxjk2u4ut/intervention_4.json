I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. The situation is about privacy versus trust in a relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author moved in with their girlfriend and initially gave her their password, explaining they don't need hers since they don't want to go through her stuff. Then the girlfriend found some old stuff like browser history, old messages, and photos with exes. The author feels embarrassed and wants privacy, so they changed the passwords. The girlfriend is upset, thinking it's about trust.\n\nThe key points here are consent and privacy. The author gave the password once, but now they feel uncomfortable because their privacy is being invaded. The girlfriend is using the access to look through things that are personal and possibly irrelevant now. The author is trying to regain control over their personal space.\n\nIn relationships, trust is important, but so is mutual respect for each other's boundaries. If one partner is using access to the other's devices to pry into past matters that don't affect the current relationship, that might be overstepping. The author isn't hiding anything malicious; they're just protecting old data that's not relevant. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that sharing passwords is a sign of trust and transparency. However, trust isn't about having unrestricted access to someone's past. If the author wants to maintain some privacy without lying or hiding current issues, changing passwords makes sense. The fact that the author is upfront about it and not hiding anything suggests they're being honest about their privacy needs.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they're setting healthy boundaries. The problem here is the girlfriend's behavior of invading privacy under the guise of trust. The author's action is about self-respect and maintaining personal space, which is reasonable. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
