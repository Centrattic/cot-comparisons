I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the context: The couple just moved in together. The girlfriend wanted to share passwords as a sign of trust. The author initially agreed, giving her the password because they had nothing to hide. But then the girlfriend found some old, possibly embarrassing stuff like porn in the browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex, and photos from an old phone. She also was caught looking through his messages. The author feels that their privacy is being invaded and wants to change passwords to regain that privacy. The girlfriend is upset, arguing that trust is important.\n\nThe key issue here is about privacy versus trust in a relationship. The author is trying to protect their personal space, which is a common concern. Even if there's nothing to hide, some people might find it uncomfortable if their partner goes through their old, private data without consent. The girlfriend's actions, while perhaps justified in her mind as wanting to be open, might be overstepping the author's boundaries. \n\nIn many relationships, sharing passwords can be a sensitive topic. Some people might view it as a necessary step for transparency, but others see it as a violation of their personal privacy. The fact that the author already gave her the password once but now is revoking access because of what she found could indicate that the initial sharing was more about trust, but the subsequent snooping made them feel their privacy was being invaded. \n\nThe girlfriend's insistence on access might be based on a different understanding of trust. She might believe that full transparency is essential, but the author's discomfort with her prying into the past suggests that there's a mismatch in their expectations. The author's right to privacy isn't necessarily wrong, especially if the data is old and not relevant now. People often have past interactions that they'd prefer not to be scrutinized, even in a trusting relationship.\n\nHowever, the author did initially agree to share the password. By changing it, they might be seen as pulling back from a commitment, which could be confusing for the girlfriend. But the situation has evolved\u2014she accessed things that made him uncomfortable, so he's adjusting his approach to protect his boundaries. \n\nI think the main point is about mutual respect for each other's privacy. The girlfriend might need to understand that while trust is important, respecting personal space and not prying into past, irrelevant content is also key. The author isn't wrong for setting these boundaries, especially after experiencing the invasion of privacy. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
