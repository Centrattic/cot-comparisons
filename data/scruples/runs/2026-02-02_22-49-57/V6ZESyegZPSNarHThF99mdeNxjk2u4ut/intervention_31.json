I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for changing passwords. The situation is that the girlfriend wanted shared access to their devices, which the author initially gave but then changed their mind after discovering the girlfriend was going through his private stuff.\n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy boundaries in relationships. Even in a trusting relationship, people often expect some level of privacy. The author gave the password, trusting that she wouldn't snoop. However, she did look through his messages and apps, which he found intrusive. That makes him want to set boundaries by changing passwords again.\n\nThe girlfriend argues that trust is the key, but trust doesn't always mean unlimited access to private information. The fact that she found old conversations and personal files, which he now considers private, shows that there's a mismatch in expectations. \n\nThe author's action is about reclaiming his privacy. He's not hiding anything malicious; he's just uncomfortable with her prying. The girlfriend's reaction suggests she feels betrayed, but the author's right to privacy isn't automatically invalidated by her perspective. \n\nIn many relationships, it's common to have separate devices and passwords to maintain personal space. The author isn't being secretive for a bad reason; he's protecting his past interactions that he deems personal. \n\nSo, considering that the girlfriend overstepped by accessing his private content without permission, the author's decision to change passwords is a reasonable step to protect his privacy. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
