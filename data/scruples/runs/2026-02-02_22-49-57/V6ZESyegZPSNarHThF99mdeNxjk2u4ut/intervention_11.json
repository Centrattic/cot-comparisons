I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for changing their passwords after their girlfriend accessed their private stuff.\n\nFirst, the situation: The couple moved in together. The girlfriend asked to share passwords as a sign of trust. The author initially gave her the password but later changed it when the girlfriend went through his things. The author feels their privacy is being invaded, even though they don't have anything to hide. The girlfriend is upset because she believes they should trust each other.\n\nHmm. Trust is important in a relationship, but so is privacy. The author is setting boundaries, which is natural. The girlfriend, however, might see it as a breach of trust. But the key here is that the author is not hiding anything malicious; it's just personal history. The author is trying to protect their privacy after the girlfriend crossed boundaries by looking through messages and old data without consent. \n\nIn many cases, people have the right to their own privacy, even in a relationship. Changing passwords to prevent unwanted access isn't inherently wrong if it's about maintaining personal space. The girlfriend's actions of searching through the author's devices without clear consent might be the real issue here. The author isn't hiding something illegal or harmful; it's just past conversations and files. So the author is probably within their rights to protect their privacy. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
