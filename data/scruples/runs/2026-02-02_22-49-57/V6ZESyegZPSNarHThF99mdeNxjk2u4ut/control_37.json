I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for changing their passwords. So the situation is that the person gave their girlfriend their passwords to show trust, but then the girlfriend started going through their private stuff. Now the author is changing the passwords again to keep some privacy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of trust in a relationship. The girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a sign of trust. The author initially gave their password, but after the girlfriend invaded their privacy by looking through old messages and files, they decided to take back their privacy. The author's reasoning is that even though there's nothing to hide, they want privacy from past, irrelevant stuff.\n\nThe key points here are mutual trust and boundaries. The girlfriend might feel that changing passwords is a breach of trust because she was under the impression that sharing passwords was a mutual agreement. However, the author might feel that their privacy was invaded, so taking back control of their devices is necessary. \n\nIn healthy relationships, both partners should respect each other's boundaries. The girlfriend's actions of prying into the author's past without permission could be seen as overstepping. The author changing passwords could be a way to set a boundary to protect their privacy. \n\nBut then, if the initial agreement was to share passwords, the author changing them without discussing it first might come off as secretive. However, the context is that the girlfriend was already invading privacy, so the author's action is a response to that. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're asserting their right to privacy after their trust was violated. The girlfriend's actions were the problem. The author is trying to reestablish boundaries, which is reasonable. So the answer should be B.\n"
