I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for changing their passwords so their girlfriend can't access their devices anymore. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and his girlfriend moved in together, and she wanted to share passwords as a sign of trust. He agreed to give her his password but didn't get hers in return. Then she went through his stuff, found things like old browser history, Skype chats with an ex, some pictures on an old phone, and even looked through his messages when he wasn't around. He's uncomfortable with the privacy invasion and changed the passwords again. She's upset because she feels he's breaking trust.\n\nThe author's main points: He gave her his password but didn't get hers. He's not hiding anything, but he's uncomfortable with her prying into old, irrelevant stuff. He wants privacy and changed the passwords. She argues that trust means sharing everything.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, I think privacy is important in relationships, even in couples. Just because you're in a relationship doesn't mean you have to share every aspect of your life. It's reasonable to set boundaries. The girlfriend might feel hurt, but that doesn't mean the author is wrong for wanting privacy. On the flip side, mutual trust is also important. The author didn't hide anything from her when she had access, so changing passwords now seems like a way to protect his privacy. \n\nBut some might argue that if you agreed to share passwords, you can't just take it back later. However, the author didn't get hers in return, which is a bit of an imbalance. Also, she went through his stuff without permission, which is a breach of trust. So he's responding to her actions by setting boundaries. \n\nI think the key here is that the girlfriend didn't respect his privacy when she had access, so he's adjusting the situation to protect himself. The fact that he didn't hide anything and was open when she had the password before supports his position. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
