I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The person is asking if changing their passwords to keep their girlfriend from accessing their devices is a mistake. \n\nFirst, the situation: They moved in together, the girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a trust thing. The author gave her the password but now realizes she's been going through his stuff\u2014looking at old messages, browsing history, etc. He feels his privacy is invaded, even though he doesn't mind the content she found, it's embarrassing. So he decides to change passwords to regain privacy. The girlfriend is upset, thinking they should trust each other.\n\nSo, the key points here are about boundaries and mutual respect. Sharing passwords can be a big deal. Even if the author didn't have anything to hide, allowing someone full access to all their devices might not be necessary. The girlfriend is invading his privacy by going through his messages and old data, which is a red flag. The author is trying to set a boundary by changing passwords, which is a reasonable response. \n\nIn relationships, privacy is important. Just because two people are in a relationship doesn't mean they have to share all their personal information. The author isn't doing anything illegal or unethical by securing his devices. The girlfriend's actions of prying into his past might be the issue here. The author is trying to protect his personal space, which is understandable.\n\nBut some might argue that if he initially gave her the password, he's implicitly allowed her access. However, people can change their minds about sharing information, especially when they feel uncomfortable. The author's main concern is privacy and embarrassment, not secrecy. So, changing passwords is a way to maintain personal boundaries. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction suggests she values transparency, but the author's actions are about protecting his personal data. Both have valid points, but the act of changing passwords to prevent invasion of privacy isn't inherently wrong. The real issue might be the girlfriend's behavior in the first place. So, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
