I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The scenario is about a girlfriend and boyfriend who moved in together. The girlfriend wanted shared access to each other's devices, showing trust. The guy initially gave her his password because he thought there was nothing to hide, but then she started going through his stuff, looking at old messages, photos, etc., which he found embarrassing. Now he's changing his passwords to regain privacy, and she's upset because she feels it's about trust.\n\nSo the question is whether he's at fault. According to AITA (Am I the Asshole) standards, the community often looks at whether the actions are reasonable and if there's a balance in the relationship. The guy's argument is about privacy, which is a valid concern. He's moved in together, but personal devices can still have personal data. The girlfriend's expectation of shared passwords might not be entirely reasonable because people have a right to privacy even in relationships. However, she might feel that since she shared her own passwords, he should do the same. \n\nThe key points are: the guy didn't want her to have access to his personal data, even if there's nothing harmful, because it's private. Changing passwords to prevent her from accessing without his presence is a way to protect his privacy. The girlfriend is upset because she sees it as a breach of trust. But the guy is setting boundaries, which is healthy. \n\nIn AITA contexts, the community often sides with the person setting boundaries for privacy, especially if the other party is overstepping. The girlfriend's actions of going through his messages and finding old stuff might be seen as invasive, even if she has the password. The guy changing passwords isn't hiding something, just protecting his privacy. So he's probably not in the wrong. The answer would be B (No).\n"
