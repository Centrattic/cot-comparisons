I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author did the wrong thing by changing their passwords so their girlfriend can't access their devices. The situation involves the girlfriend wanting shared passwords as a gesture of trust, but then looking into personal stuff from the past.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author gave the girlfriend their password, but then the girlfriend went through old messages, browser history, and other personal data, which embarrassed the author. The author is now changing passwords to regain privacy, which the girlfriend is upset about because she feels it's a breach of trust.\n\nThe key points here are about privacy versus trust. The author might feel that their privacy is being invaded even though they initially agreed to share passwords. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might see this as a lack of trust. \n\nIn relationships, privacy is a personal boundary. Even if one person is open to sharing passwords, it doesn't mean they have to allow invasive access to personal history. The author's actions could be seen as setting a boundary to protect their privacy, which is reasonable. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from feeling that the author is hiding something, but the author's discomfort arises from the invasion of past, irrelevant data. \n\nI need to check if changing passwords is a justified response. If the author is uncomfortable with their past being poked into, even if there's nothing to hide, they have the right to set limits. Trust doesn't necessarily mean complete access to all personal data, especially if it's making one party uncomfortable. \n\nThe girlfriend might argue that trust means transparency, but the author has the right to privacy. It's a balance both need to negotiate. The author isn't in the wrong for protecting their personal space, especially when the access led to embarrassment. \n\nSo, based on this, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
