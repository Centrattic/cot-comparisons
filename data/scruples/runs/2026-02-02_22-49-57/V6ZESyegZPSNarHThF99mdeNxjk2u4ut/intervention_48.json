I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices.\n\nFirst, the situation: The couple moved in together. The girlfriend wanted shared passwords to show trust. The author initially gave her the password but later changed it after she went through his personal stuff. The author is upset about her invading his privacy, finding old stuff, and feeling like she's prying. Now he's changing passwords again to have privacy. She's upset, saying they should trust each other.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about boundaries and privacy. Even in a relationship, people might need some privacy. The girlfriend wanted shared access, but the author feels that's a two-way street. He gave her access but didn't get the same. Then she went through his stuff, which he found intrusive. Changing passwords seems like a way to set a boundary. \n\nBut then there's the aspect of trust. The girlfriend feels the password change is a breach of trust. However, the author is asserting his right to privacy. The question is whether changing passwords is in the wrong. \n\nI think the author isn't wrong. Privacy is important. Even in relationships, people have the right to personal space. The girlfriend's actions of searching through his devices without permission are the issue here. The author is just trying to protect his privacy after her invasion. So, answer B.\n"
