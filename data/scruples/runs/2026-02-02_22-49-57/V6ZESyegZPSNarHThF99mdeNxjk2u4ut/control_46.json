I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The situation involves a girlfriend wanting access to their devices, which led to privacy issues.\n\nFirst, the author initially gave their password out of trust. The girlfriend then went through his past data, which he found embarrassing. He changed the passwords to regain privacy. Now she's upset, arguing about trust.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, sharing passwords can be seen as a trust issue. But on the other hand, privacy is important. The girlfriend's actions\u2014looking through messages and old data\u2014might make the author feel his boundaries are crossed. \n\nThe key points are consent and mutual respect. The author gave the password once but didn't have to continue allowing access. Changing passwords to protect personal information is a reasonable action. The girlfriend's invasion of privacy might have justified the author's decision. \n\nTrust in a relationship is mutual, but privacy is also a right. The author isn't doing anything wrong by setting boundaries. The girlfriend might need to respect those boundaries. So the answer is probably B (not in the wrong).\n"
