I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. \n\nFirst, the situation: The couple moved in together. The girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a sign of trust. The author gave her the password but later changed it after she went through his stuff, finding old stuff that's embarrassing. Now he's changing passwords again to keep his privacy.\n\nSo, the main question is about boundaries and trust. The author gave the password initially but changed it after feeling his privacy was invaded. The girlfriend is upset because she thinks they should trust each other. \n\nI think the key points are about mutual respect for privacy. Even in a relationship, people have a right to personal space. The girlfriend went through his messages and apps without consent, which is a privacy violation. The author's response to change passwords is a way to set boundaries. \n\nThe author isn't doing anything illegal or unethical. He's protecting his personal information. The girlfriend's actions are the issue here. So, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
