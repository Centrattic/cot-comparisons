I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The situation is that the girlfriend wanted shared access to their devices as a trust thing. The author gave her the password but later changed it because the girlfriend was going through his stuff and finding old, irrelevant stuff. Now, he's considering changing passwords again to keep some privacy.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate who's at fault here. The key points are privacy versus trust. The girlfriend expected shared passwords as a sign of trust, but the author was uncomfortable with her accessing private data. The girlfriend went through his messages and found old stuff, which embarrassed him. He changed the passwords to maintain privacy, which she took as a breach of trust.\n\nIn relationships, trust is important, but so is respecting individual privacy. The author didn't do anything harmful by changing the passwords. He was trying to set boundaries to protect his personal information. The girlfriend's actions of going through his stuff without permission might be the real issue here. The author isn't hiding anything; he's just setting limits on how much access he's willing to give. \n\nHowever, communication is key. If the author didn't discuss his reasons clearly, it might have caused misunderstanding. But the question is whether he's in the wrong for changing passwords. Since he's asserting his right to privacy and the girlfriend was already intruding, the author isn't in the wrong. The responsibility here might lie more with the girlfriend for not respecting his boundaries.\n"
