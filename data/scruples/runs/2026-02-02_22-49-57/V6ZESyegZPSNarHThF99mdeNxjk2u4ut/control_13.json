I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the couple moved in together. The girlfriend wanted to share passwords as a show of trust. The author agreed to give her his password because he felt there's nothing to hide. But then she found various things in his browser history, old messages, old photos, and even went through his phone when he wasn't looking. He's now changing his passwords again to have privacy, which upsets her because she thinks they should trust each other.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author initially gave her the password, which she used to access his devices. She found personal stuff and even snooped when he wasn't around. He's now taking back control by changing passwords to maintain privacy. The question is whether he's in the wrong for doing that.\n\nFrom a trust and privacy perspective, people have different boundaries. The author isn't hiding anything malicious; he's just uncomfortable with her accessing his past. Even though he shared the password initially, that doesn't mean he has to keep it that way. He's setting a boundary to protect his privacy, which is a reasonable action. The girlfriend, on the other hand, might feel betrayed if she sees password changes as a lack of trust. However, the fact that she was going through his phone without his knowledge is a bigger issue. Trust shouldn't mean allowing someone to invade your privacy without consent. So the author is just reclaiming his right to privacy, which he's entitled to. Therefore, he's not in the wrong.\n"
