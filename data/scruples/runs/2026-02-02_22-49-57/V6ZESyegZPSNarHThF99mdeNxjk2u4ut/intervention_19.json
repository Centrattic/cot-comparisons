I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong after changing their passwords. The situation is that the girlfriend and the author moved in together, and she wanted to share passwords as a sign of trust. He gave her his password, but then she started going through his stuff, finding old stuff, and invading his privacy. Now he wants to change his passwords to regain some privacy, and she's upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author gave his password out of trust, but the girlfriend used it to access his private information. The author feels that his privacy is being invaded, especially with things from the past. He's changing the passwords to set boundaries, which seems reasonable. The question is whether he's in the wrong for doing so.\n\nOn one hand, the girlfriend might feel that not sharing passwords is a breach of trust since they agreed to share them. But on the other hand, everyone has the right to some level of privacy in a relationship. Trust is important, but mutual respect for personal boundaries is also crucial. The author didn't do anything wrong by initially sharing the password, but he has every right to change it if he feels uncomfortable. The girlfriend's actions of going through his messages without consent are actually the issue here. \n\nThe core issue is about balancing trust and privacy. The author is reclaiming his privacy after his boundaries were crossed. In a healthy relationship, both partners should respect each other's privacy. The fact that the girlfriend didn't respect his privacy when he gave her access doesn't make him wrong for taking it back. He's not hiding anything but is asserting that his past communications and history are personal matters. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. He's adjusting his actions based on the girlfriend's behavior, which shows he's setting appropriate boundaries.\n"
