I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for changing their passwords so their girlfriend can't access their devices anymore. The writer moved in together and initially gave her the passwords because they didn't care to have hers and there's nothing to hide. However, the girlfriend found some old, possibly embarrassing stuff like porn in browser history, old Skype chats with an ex, pictures on an old phone, and even looked through the writer's messages. Now the writer wants to change passwords to maintain privacy, but the girlfriend is upset because she believes trust should mean sharing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and relational aspects. In a relationship, trust is crucial, but so is personal privacy. The writer isn't hiding anything new or harmful; they're dealing with past content that's no longer relevant. The girlfriend, on the other hand, is prying into these matters, which the writer finds intrusive. \n\nChanging passwords can be seen as an attempt to set boundaries. The writer might feel that sharing passwords leads to being exposed in ways that feel uncomfortable, even if there's nothing to hide. The girlfriend's reaction suggests she might not respect these boundaries, which could be a problem. \n\nBut then, the writer did give the passwords initially, so there's a point where they agreed to share. However, they now want to revoke that access. Is that fair? Maybe the writer didn't anticipate the extent of her curiosity or the sensitivity of old data. \n\nThe key factors here are mutual consent and respect for boundaries. The writer isn't being secretive out of deceit but wants to protect their past, which isn't affecting the current relationship. The girlfriend's actions, like searching messages without asking, might be the real issue. The writer's right to privacy shouldn't be compromised just because they shared passwords once. \n\nSo, the answer leans towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They have the right to adjust their privacy settings as needed, especially if they feel their personal space is being invaded. The girlfriend should respect that, even if she finds it hard to accept.\n"
