I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend wanting access to the person's devices and messages, and after finding some personal stuff, the person decides to change passwords to maintain privacy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a sign of trust. The author gave her the password initially, but then changed it when the girlfriend started snooping through personal items, like old messages, porn history, and private photos. The author feels that even though there's nothing to hide, the privacy of old, irrelevant personal data is being invaded. The girlfriend is upset because she feels this is a breach of trust.\n\nSo, legally, the person isn't doing anything wrong. They have the right to privacy, even in a relationship. But socially or emotionally, it's more complex. The girlfriend might feel hurt or betrayed by the password change, interpreting it as a lack of trust. However, the author has a right to set boundaries. The key here is whether the girlfriend's actions were respectful. If she's going through the author's private messages without consent, even if she has the password, that's an invasion of privacy. The author is reclaiming their privacy by changing passwords, which is a reasonable response.\n\nIn relationships, trust is important, but mutual respect for privacy is also crucial. The author isn't hiding anything new or harmful; they're protecting past personal data that doesn't affect their current relationship. The girlfriend's actions of snooping through messages, even if she has access, aren't respectful. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for taking steps to protect their privacy. The answer should be B.\n"
