I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for changing their passwords. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe author moved in with their girlfriend, and she wanted to share passwords to show trust. The author agreed to give her the password but didn't like that she went through his stuff. He found things like old browser history, Skype conversations, and photos. Even though he says there's nothing to hide, he's embarrassed about his past stuff being found. Now he wants to change his passwords to keep some privacy, but she's upset and says they should trust each other.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are trust, privacy, and boundaries. The author is conflicted because he gave her the password but now feels his privacy is invaded. She's using the trust argument to justify looking through his devices, which makes him uncomfortable.\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong here. Everyone has a right to their privacy, even in a relationship. Just because you share a password doesn't mean the other person should go through your personal stuff. The girlfriend's actions of prying into past conversations and photos, even if they're not secret anymore, can be seen as intrusive. The author is trying to set boundaries to protect his personal space, which is reasonable. Trust is important, but it shouldn't come at the cost of someone feeling they have free access to another's personal life. So the answer should be B.\n"
