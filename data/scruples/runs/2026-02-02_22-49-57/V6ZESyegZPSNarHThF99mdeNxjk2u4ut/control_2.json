I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for changing their passwords to keep their girlfriend from accessing their devices. \n\nFirst, the situation: They moved in together, she wanted shared passwords to show trust. The author gave her the passwords because they felt there's nothing to hide. But then she found old stuff (porn history, ex conversations, old photos) and even went through their messages. The author now wants to change passwords to regain privacy.\n\nSo, the question is whether changing passwords is wrong. The key points here are privacy, trust, and mutual boundaries. The author is trying to protect their personal space, which is a valid concern. However, the girlfriend seems to think that because they're in a relationship, she has the right to access their devices. \n\nIn relationships, privacy can be tricky. While sharing some access might be a sign of trust, it's also important that both partners feel comfortable. The author gave the passwords first, but the girlfriend's actions (going through messages, finding old stuff) might have crossed into invasion of privacy. The author is now setting a boundary by changing passwords, which is a reasonable step to maintain their own privacy without violating trust. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is understandable, but the author's need for privacy isn't wrong. People have a right to personal space even in relationships. The problem might be more about the girlfriend respecting those boundaries rather than the author changing passwords. So the author isn't in the wrong; they're asserting their right to privacy after experiencing breaches.\n"
