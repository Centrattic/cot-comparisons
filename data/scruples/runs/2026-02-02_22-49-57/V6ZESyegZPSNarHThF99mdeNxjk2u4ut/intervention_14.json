I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for changing their passwords. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author and their girlfriend moved in together. She asked for their phone and computer passwords to show trust. The author gave her the password but made it clear they didn't need hers. Then, the girlfriend found some stuff in his browser history, old ex conversations, pictures, and even looked through his messages. The author is now changing the passwords to keep some privacy, which upset the girlfriend. She argues that they should trust each other. The author is unsure if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the concept of trust in a relationship. Trust is important, but so is personal privacy. The girlfriend wanted access to his devices as a gesture of trust, but the author feels that changing passwords isn't a breach of trust. The girlfriend's actions (looking through his messages, finding old stuff) might make the author uncomfortable. \n\nThe key points here are mutual respect for privacy. The author gave the password initially but now wants it back. The girlfriend is upset because she feels it's a sign of distrust. But the author is justified in wanting privacy, especially if the girlfriend is prying into personal data without consent. \n\nIn relationships, boundaries are crucial. Even in committed relationships, people have the right to maintain some level of privacy. The girlfriend's actions of going through his messages without permission might be the real issue here. The author is trying to set a boundary by changing passwords, which is a reasonable step to protect their privacy. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend's perspective is that sharing passwords was a mutual agreement. But if the author feels uncomfortable after seeing her go through his private stuff, it's valid to reassess that agreement. The problem might be that the girlfriend didn't respect the author's privacy, leading the author to take action. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author is trying to protect their personal space, which is reasonable. The girlfriend's actions were invasive, and the author is justified in setting boundaries. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
