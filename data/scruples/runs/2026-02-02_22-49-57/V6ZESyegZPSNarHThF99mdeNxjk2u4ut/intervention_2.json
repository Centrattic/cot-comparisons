I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend wanting access to their devices, and the author changed passwords to maintain privacy. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants to confirm.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend wanted shared passwords to show trust, but the author didn't reciprocate. The author gave their password but the girlfriend then went through his stuff, leading to privacy issues. The author changed passwords to protect their privacy, which the girlfriend saw as a breach of trust.\n\nIn relationships, boundaries are important. Trust is mutual, but that doesn't mean giving up all privacy. The author might feel their privacy is invaded when the other person goes through their old messages and files. Changing passwords could be seen as setting a boundary to protect personal space.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that transparency is essential in a trusting relationship. But the author has the right to personal privacy. The fact that the author was upfront about not wanting her password shows they were clear about their boundaries. The girlfriend's actions of going through his stuff without his consent might be the real issue here.\n\nSo, the author changing passwords is a reasonable response to protect their privacy after the other person overstepped. They're not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
