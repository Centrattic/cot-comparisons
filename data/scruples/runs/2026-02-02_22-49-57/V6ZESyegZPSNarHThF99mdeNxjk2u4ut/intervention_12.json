I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for changing their passwords so their girlfriend can't access their devices anymore. They moved in together, and she wanted shared passwords as a trust thing. The author initially gave her their password but now changed it after she went through their stuff.\n\nFirst, the key points: The girlfriend accessed personal information like browser history, old messages, and photos without the author's consent. The author feels their privacy is being invaded and is setting boundaries by changing passwords. The girlfriend is upset, arguing that trust should mean no privacy barriers.\n\nNow, considering privacy in relationships. Even in committed relationships, individuals have a right to privacy. Trust doesn't mean you have to give someone access to your personal devices. The girlfriend's actions of searching through private data without asking cross into invasion of privacy. The author is reclaiming their privacy, which is a reasonable response. \n\nAlso, the author made it clear that they don't want to access her passwords, maintaining mutual respect. The fact that the girlfriend is upset might indicate she expects more transparency than the author is comfortable with. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're protecting their personal space, which is healthy. The real issue is the girlfriend's behavior, not the author's decision to set boundaries.\n"
