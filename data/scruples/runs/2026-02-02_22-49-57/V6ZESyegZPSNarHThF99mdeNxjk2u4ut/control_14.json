I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices.\n\nFirst, the situation: The couple moved in together. The girlfriend asked for shared passwords to show trust. The author gave her their password, expecting the same in return. However, the girlfriend found old, embarrassing stuff and started going through his messages. The author then changed their passwords to maintain privacy, which upset the girlfriend. He's questioning if he's wrong for doing so.\n\nKey points here: The author gave his password initially, but after experiencing privacy invasions, he changed it. The central issue is privacy vs. trust. The girlfriend might feel hurt because she believes in open, trusting relationships, but the author has a right to privacy. The fact that she went through his messages without his knowledge is a red flag. \n\nThe author isn't hiding anything malicious; the content found was old and not relevant anymore. His actions are about setting boundaries, which is reasonable. The girlfriend's behavior of searching through his phone and finding old messages is invasive. \n\nIn relationships, mutual trust is important, but so is respecting each other's privacy. The author's decision to change passwords isn't about distrust but about reclaiming personal space. The girlfriend's expectation that they should have full access to each other's devices isn't healthy, as it can lead to privacy issues and potential conflicts. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. He's setting healthy boundaries after experiencing a breach of privacy. The answer should be B.\n"
