I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend wants to share passwords as a sign of trust. The author initially gave her the password because they feel there's nothing to hide. But then the girlfriend starts going through his stuff\u2014browser history, old conversations, messages. The author is uncomfortable with this invasion of privacy, even if the content isn't sensitive anymore. So they decide to change the passwords to regain privacy, and the girlfriend is upset about it, arguing that trust should mean no need for passwords.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. The key points here are about privacy in a relationship and mutual trust. The author is setting boundaries to protect their personal space, which is a common need even in committed relationships. The girlfriend, on the other hand, sees this as a lack of trust. But the author explains that they aren't hiding anything; they just want their past conversations to remain private. \n\nI think the author is justified. Everyone has a right to privacy, even in relationships. The problem here is that the girlfriend is overstepping by accessing personal information without consent, even if it's old. The author's response is a reasonable way to protect their privacy. The girlfriend's expectation of shared access might stem from a lack of understanding of personal boundaries. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong) because they are protecting their privacy, which is a valid concern. The girlfriend's actions are the issue here, not the author's decision to set boundaries.\n"
