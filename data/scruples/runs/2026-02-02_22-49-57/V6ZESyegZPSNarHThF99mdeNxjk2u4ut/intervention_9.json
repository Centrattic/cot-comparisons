I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The couple recently moved in together, and the girlfriend wanted to share passwords as a sign of trust. The author initially gave her the password, explaining that they didn't need hers because they trust each other. However, the girlfriend started going through his stuff\u2014finding old porn, old messages, etc. The author found this embarrassing and decided to change the passwords to regain some privacy.\n\nNow, the key points here are about boundaries and mutual respect. The author was okay with sharing the password at first, but when the girlfriend started invading his privacy by looking through his personal data, he felt the need to set a boundary. The girlfriend's actions might be seen as crossing a line, especially since the author didn't explicitly consent to her searching through his devices. \n\nIn relationships, trust and privacy can sometimes clash. While sharing passwords can be a gesture of trust, it shouldn't come at the expense of one person's privacy. The author's decision to change the passwords is a way to protect their personal space, which is reasonable. The girlfriend's expectation that they should trust her by not having passwords might not account for the fact that privacy is still important, even in a trusting relationship.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. They have the right to their privacy, and changing the passwords is a legitimate way to enforce that. The girlfriend's reaction suggests she might not respect those boundaries, which is her issue. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
