I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The situation is that the girlfriend and boyfriend moved in together. The girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a show of trust. The boyfriend gave her his password, but she started looking through his old browser history, messages, etc. He finds it embarrassing and wants to set boundaries by changing passwords again. She's upset and says they should trust each other.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The boyfriend's perspective is about privacy. Even though he gave the password initially, he changed his mind because he felt his privacy was invaded. The girlfriend might see this as a betrayal of trust. But is privacy a valid reason here?\n\nIn relationships, trust is important, but so is mutual respect for boundaries. The boyfriend might not have done anything wrong by setting limits. If he felt uncomfortable with her accessing his old data, it's reasonable to want to protect his privacy. The key here is that he's not hiding anything malicious; it's just personal history he's not interested in sharing now.\n\nOn the other hand, if he agreed to share passwords as a gesture of trust, then changing them later could seem like a breach of that trust. But maybe the initial sharing wasn't a mutual agreement. The girlfriend might have expected ongoing access, but he might have given the password reluctantly. The fact that she went through his messages even after he gave the password might be a bigger issue. He has the right to his privacy, especially if the sharing made him feel forced or if he didn't want to share anymore.\n\nSo, considering that, the boyfriend isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to protect his privacy. The problem might be more about communication. He should have discussed his boundaries before sharing the password. But given the situation now, changing passwords to maintain privacy isn't inherently wrong. The answer might be B (No).\n"
