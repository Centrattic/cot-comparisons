I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. The author gave her their password but then she started looking through his stuff, which made him uncomfortable. Now he wants to change the passwords to have some privacy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider privacy in relationships. Even in a committed relationship, people often expect some level of personal privacy. Sharing passwords can feel like a breach of that privacy, especially if one partner is uncomfortable with the other going through their personal data. The girlfriend's actions\u2014looking through messages, browser history, etc.\u2014could be seen as invasive. The author is trying to set boundaries, which is a reasonable thing to do.\n\nBut the girlfriend argues that trust should mean no secrets. However, trust doesn't necessarily mean complete transparency in every aspect. People have pasts and personal stuff that might not be relevant or appropriate for others to access. The author isn't hiding something malicious; they just want privacy. Changing passwords is a way to protect that privacy, which is a valid action.\n\nI should also think about mutual respect. If the author agreed to share their password, maybe they expected the same level of respect from their partner. The fact that the girlfriend went through his things without clear permission could be the real issue here. The author's response is about reclaiming their privacy, which is a reasonable reaction to feeling invaded.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. They're asserting their right to privacy, which is important for healthy relationships. The girlfriend might need to respect that boundary instead of expecting full access. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
