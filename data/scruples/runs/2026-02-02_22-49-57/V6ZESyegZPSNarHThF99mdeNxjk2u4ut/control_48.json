I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who changed their passwords is in the wrong. The scenario is that the boyfriend and girlfriend moved in together. The girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a sign of trust. The guy gave her his passwords, but then she started going through his stuff, finding old messages, pictures, etc. He's now changing his passwords again to have some privacy, and she's upset because she feels that's breaking trust.\n\nSo, the main question is about boundaries and trust in a relationship. On one hand, sharing passwords can be a way to show trust. But on the other hand, privacy is also important. The guy didn't have access to her stuff, which he was okay with. The problem here is that the girlfriend used the shared access to invade his privacy. He felt it was necessary to reclaim his privacy by changing passwords.\n\nI think the key points are mutual respect and communication. The guy made it clear he didn't care about her passwords, but she still went through his stuff. Changing passwords to maintain privacy isn't inherently wrong. People have the right to their privacy even in relationships. So, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong. The issue is more about how they communicate and set boundaries moving forward. The answer is B.\n"
