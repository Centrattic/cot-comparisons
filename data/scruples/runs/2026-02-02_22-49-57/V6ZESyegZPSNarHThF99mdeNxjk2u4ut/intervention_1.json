I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. The situation is that the girlfriend wanted shared passwords to show trust, but the author gave hers but didn't like that she was going through his stuff. He changed his passwords to keep some privacy.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The girlfriend's perspective is that trust in a relationship means sharing access. She might feel that not sharing passwords is a breach of trust. On the other hand, the author wants privacy, especially from old, irrelevant stuff that's now embarrassing when discovered.\n\nPrivacy is a valid concern. Even if there's nothing to hide, past data can be sensitive. The author might not feel comfortable having his past scrutinized, even if it's not related to current issues. The girlfriend, however, might see this as a red flag, thinking he's hiding something. But the key here is that the author isn't hiding anything new; he's just protecting old data that's not relevant now.\n\nThe fact that the author gave her his password initially shows a willingness to share some access. But when he found out she was going through his messages and apps, that's a boundary being crossed. So changing passwords to prevent her from accessing his devices without permission seems like a reasonable step to protect his privacy. \n\nIn relationships, trust is important, but so is mutual respect for personal space. The girlfriend might not understand that privacy doesn't equate to distrust. The author is asserting his right to keep certain things private, which is normal. However, communication is key here. If he could explain why he's doing it without making her feel excluded, it might help. But the act itself\u2014changing passwords\u2014is a way to maintain boundaries.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. He's protecting his privacy after his boundaries were crossed. The answer should be B.\n"
