I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. I need to analyze the scenario carefully.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend asked for shared passwords to show trust. The author gave his password but set clear boundaries about not wanting hers. However, the girlfriend has been going through his old devices and private messages, which makes him uncomfortable. He changed the passwords to regain privacy, and she's upset, arguing that trust is important.\n\nThe key points here are about mutual respect and boundaries in a relationship. Trust is important, but so is personal privacy. The girlfriend's actions\u2014looking through old conversations, finding personal files\u2014suggest she's overstepped, even if she did it with the intention of transparency. The author's response to change passwords is a way to protect his privacy, which is a reasonable action if he feels his boundaries are being violated.\n\nI should consider if changing passwords is a valid way to enforce personal space. In relationships, while sharing can be a gesture of trust, it shouldn't come at the expense of one person's comfort. The author isn't hiding anything malicious; he's just protecting past, irrelevant information. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from feeling excluded, but the author's right to privacy isn't wrong here. So, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
