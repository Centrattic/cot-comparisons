I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for changing their passwords to prevent their girlfriend from accessing their devices. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They moved in together, and the girlfriend wanted shared passwords as a trust thing. The author initially gave her the password but later changed it after she found some old, personal stuff. Now the girlfriend is upset, and the author is wondering if they did the right thing.\n\nHmm. The key points here are privacy and trust. The author is setting boundaries to maintain their privacy, which is a reasonable thing. Everyone has a right to some level of privacy, even in a relationship. The girlfriend, on the other hand, expected shared access because they're in a trusting relationship. \n\nBut wait, the author mentioned that the girlfriend was going through their messages and apps, which is a bit of a red flag. If the girlfriend was invading their privacy without permission, then changing passwords is a way to protect that privacy. The author isn't hiding anything malicious; they just want to keep old, irrelevant stuff private. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is also important. She's upset because she feels the author isn't trusting her. But trust doesn't mean giving access to every part of your digital life. Healthy relationships have boundaries. The author isn't being secretive for no reason; they're protecting their own personal space. \n\nOn the flip side, maybe the author should have discussed this earlier instead of just changing passwords. But the situation shows that the girlfriend was already intrusive, so taking action makes sense. The author isn't doing something wrong by setting these boundaries. The real issue might be the girlfriend's behavior in the first place, like going through messages without consent. \n\nSo overall, the author isn't in the wrong. They have a right to privacy, and changing passwords is a reasonable step to maintain it. The answer should be B.\n"
