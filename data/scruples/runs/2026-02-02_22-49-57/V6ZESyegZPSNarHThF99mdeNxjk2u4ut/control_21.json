I\u2019ve made it pretty clear that I don\u2019t care to have her passwords as there\u2019s never really any reason for me to go through her stuff, and that I\u2019d expect it to be similar from her perspective. But I gave her the password anyways since I know there\u2019s really nothing to hide. \n\nWell since that\u2019s happened she has questioned me about porn she found in my browser history, old Skype conversations with an ex she found somewhere on my old computer from 2013, pictures of girls on an old old phone I still had that was packed away somewhere in a box, and have walked in to our bedroom to hearing my phone close and when I look through the open apps see she was going through conversations in my messages and apps. \n\nI don\u2019t really care that she\u2019s found these things, but it\u2019s a bit embarrassing to have someone read through these personal conversations from the past that mean nothing anymore. I told her tonight that I\u2019m changing my passwords so that I still feel like I have some privacy. She was obviously super upset about it and says there\u2019s no reason for me to do that since we should trust each other.\n\nAITA for changing my passwords so she doesn\u2019t have access when I\u2019m not around? I\u2019m really on the fence about this, trying to figure out what to do about next. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who is changing their passwords is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend and boyfriend moving in together. The girlfriend wanted shared passwords to show trust, but the guy gave her his password. Then she went through his stuff, found old stuff, and he's now changing his passwords to maintain privacy. He's feeling conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of trust and privacy in relationships. The girlfriend is pushing for transparency, which can be a sign of wanting closeness, but the guy has boundaries he wants to maintain. The key here is whether changing passwords is a reasonable action to protect privacy.\n\nThe guy had given her the password expecting mutual trust, but she used it to invade his privacy by looking through past conversations and other personal stuff. Even if there's nothing to hide, the invasion of privacy can be a problem. The guy's response is to set boundaries by changing passwords. This seems like a reasonable step to protect his personal space. \n\nTrust is important, but mutual respect for privacy is also crucial. The girlfriend might feel hurt because she wanted access, but the guy's actions are about his right to privacy. The fact that he's embarrassed about past things doesn't mean he did something wrong; it's about respecting his boundaries now.\n\nIn relationships, both partners should have some level of privacy. The girlfriend's actions might be overstepping, and the guy is just trying to set limits. So, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong. He's asserting his right to privacy, which is a healthy part of any relationship.\n"
