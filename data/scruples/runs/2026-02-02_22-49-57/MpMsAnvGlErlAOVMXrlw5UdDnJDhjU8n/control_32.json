I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a boyfriend who borrows the author's car to visit his grandmother, but keeps using it without refilling the gas. The author has warned him multiple times, and now she's decided to stop letting him borrow the car. He's upset and called her names.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The couple lives together, they've been for three years. The boyfriend sold his car when going back to university, so he doesn't have a vehicle. The author's car is hers, and she pays for everything. He refuses to contribute, even though he uses it. Each time he takes the car, he doesn't refill the gas, which costs $60 each trip. This has happened three times, and she's given warnings. Now, he wants to take it again, and she's told him no. He's angry, calling her juvenile and vindictive.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFrom what I can see, the author is the one who owns the car and is paying for all the expenses. The boyfriend is using her car without contributing to the costs, despite being warned multiple times. The fact that he continues to take the car without refilling the gas shows a lack of respect for her property and financial contributions. The author is trying to set a boundary to protect her own interests, which is understandable. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems to be inconsiderate. Calling her names and not acknowledging the repeated issue suggests he isn't taking her concerns seriously. The author isn't holding a grudge; she's following through on a warning after multiple instances. \n\nI think the key here is whether the boyfriend is responsible for contributing to the car's expenses since he relies on it. If he doesn't have a car, using hers but not helping with costs is unfair. The author has the right to set boundaries, especially when it's her property and money. Therefore, she's not in the wrong. So the answer should be B.\n"
