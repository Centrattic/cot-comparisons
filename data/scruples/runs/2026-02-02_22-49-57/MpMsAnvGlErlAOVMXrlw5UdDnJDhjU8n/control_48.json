I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a boyfriend and girlfriend who live together. The key points are:\n\n1. The boyfriend uses the girlfriend's car to visit his grandmother, which is 3.5 hours away.\n2. He takes the car with a full tank each time but returns it empty, costing the girlfriend $60 each trip.\n3. He's done this three times and other times as well, without paying for gas or maintenance.\n4. The girlfriend has warned him multiple times that if it continues, she'll stop letting him borrow the car.\n5. When he asks to borrow the car again, she refuses, and he reacts angrily, accusing her of being juvenile and holding grudges.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author (the girlfriend) is in the wrong. Let's look at the boyfriend's actions. He's repeatedly using her car without contributing to the costs, despite her warnings. The car is her responsibility for maintenance, insurance, and gas. The trips are significant in distance, so the gas cost is substantial. He's not just borrowing the car but also not compensating her for the expenses. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, when someone uses another person's car, especially over long distances, it's reasonable to expect that they contribute to the costs. The boyfriend's refusal to pay anything, even after multiple reminders, is a problem. The girlfriend's response is to revoke his permission to borrow the car to prevent further financial burden. \n\nHis reaction is defensive and accusatory, which might indicate he's not taking her concerns seriously. The girlfriend's actions are a form of self-protection to prevent being taken advantage of. She's setting a boundary after repeated failures to respect her terms. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the boyfriend is not meeting his end of the agreement. If he wanted to continue using the car, he should have addressed the financial aspect. The girlfriend's decision to stop allowing him to borrow the car is a logical consequence of his failure to comply with her conditions. \n\nTherefore, the author is not in the wrong. The boyfriend's behavior is the issue here. The correct answer should be B (No).\n"
