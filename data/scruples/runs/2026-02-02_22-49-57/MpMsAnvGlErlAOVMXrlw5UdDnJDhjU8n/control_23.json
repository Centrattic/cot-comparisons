I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting her boyfriend visit his grandma because he keeps draining her car's gas without refilling or contributing. \n\nFirst, financial responsibility. The boyfriend is using the car, which he's paying nothing for. The car is the author's, with her paying for insurance, maintenance, and now gas. Each trip he takes uses up her gas without reimbursement. He's been told multiple times, but hasn't changed his behavior. That seems unfair from the author's perspective.\n\nThen there's the communication aspect. The author warned him multiple times. If someone repeatedly ignores boundaries and then gets upset when the boundaries are enforced, that's an issue. The boyfriend is now upset because he can't take the car, but his actions led to losing the privilege. \n\nRespect and fairness. The boyfriend uses the car but doesn't contribute financially. That could be seen as taking advantage. The author is trying to set a boundary to protect her property and finances. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is also telling. He calls her names and accuses her of holding grudges when she's actually enforcing a rule she'd previously given him a chance to follow. This suggests he's not taking responsibility for his part in the situation. \n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and consideration for each other's resources are important. The author isn't being unreasonable by asking for a full tank or compensation for the gas used. Since he hasn't complied, her decision to revoke the car privilege is a reasonable step to address the ongoing issue. So, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
