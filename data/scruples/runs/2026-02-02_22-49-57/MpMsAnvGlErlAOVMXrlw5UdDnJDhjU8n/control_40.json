I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the user is asking if the person who wrote this scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend who's borrowing the author's car without contributing to the costs. Let me break it down.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend and his girlfriend live together, and he sold his car when he went back to university two years ago. She has her own car, which she's paying for maintenance and insurance. He refuses to pay anything because it's not his car. Now, the issue is that he borrows her car to visit his grandma, who's 3.5 hours away. Each time, he takes it with a full tank and returns it empty, costing her $60 each time. This has happened three times, and she's upset because she's paying for the gas. He apologizes but doesn't change his behavior. She told him she won't let him borrow the car anymore, and he got angry, accusing her of being vindictive.\n\nSo, the main points are: ownership of the car, contribution to costs, repeated borrowing without reimbursement, and the resulting conflict.\n\nThe author's stance is that since it's her car and he's using it without contributing to the expenses, she's justified in stopping the borrowing. The boyfriend's side is that it's not his car, so he doesn't need to pay, and he's upset when she revokes the privilege. \n\nFrom a responsibility standpoint, if someone is using a car they don't own, isn't it reasonable to expect them to cover the costs they incur? Especially since they live together and share expenses otherwise. The boyfriend isn't contributing to the car's maintenance, insurance, or gas, which are ongoing costs. Each time he uses the car, he's essentially using her resources without compensation. \n\nHe's been warned multiple times, and despite apologies, the behavior continues. The author is within her rights to stop lending the car if the terms aren't met. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be an emotional response rather than addressing the issue. He's not taking responsibility for the costs, which is the core of the problem. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. She's standing up for her own property and the costs associated with it. The boyfriend's actions are inconsiderate and disrespectful, given that he's not contributing. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
