I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a boyfriend who uses his partner's car to visit his grandmother, but doesn't refill the gas, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ownership and responsibilities. The car is the partner's, and she's paying for maintenance and insurance. The boyfriend isn't contributing, which might be a point of contention. He's borrowing the car multiple times, and each time leaves it with an empty tank. The cost adds up, especially with each trip being 3.5 hours away. He's been warned before but continues the behavior, which the partner says is unfair. \n\nThe key points here are: ownership of the car, financial responsibility, and the repeated failure to refill gas despite prior warnings. The partner's decision to stop allowing the car's use could be seen as a reasonable response to protect her own financial interests, especially since the boyfriend isn't contributing to the costs. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction, calling her juvenile and vindictive, seems dismissive of her valid concerns. If someone isn't respecting the terms of borrowing an asset (like a car) and is causing ongoing financial strain without addressing it, the person who owns the asset is justified in setting boundaries.\n\nBut maybe there's a nuance. Did the partner set clear expectations from the start? If she didn't, the boyfriend might not have known he was supposed to refill the gas. However, in this case, she mentions multiple warnings, so the boyfriend should be aware. His continued behavior suggests he's not taking her concerns seriously, which supports her decision to revoke the car use. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the boyfriend is in a tough spot, needing to visit family, but he could find alternative solutions, like contributing to gas costs or using public transport. However, the problem is the repeated neglect of the agreed-upon terms. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the partner isn't in the wrong for enforcing her boundaries after multiple infractions. She's not the one incurring unnecessary costs; the boyfriend is using her resources without contributing, which is a classic setup for conflict. The boyfriend's anger and accusations might be a defense mechanism because he's aware of the unfairness. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She's protecting her property and financial interests, and the boyfriend isn't respecting her boundaries despite being warned multiple times.\n"
