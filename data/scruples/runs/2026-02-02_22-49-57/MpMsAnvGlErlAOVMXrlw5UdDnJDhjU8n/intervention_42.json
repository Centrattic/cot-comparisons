I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple living together. The boyfriend uses the girlfriend's car to visit his grandmother, which is a 3.5-hour drive. Each time, he takes it with a full tank and returns it empty, costing about $60 each time. The girlfriend is upset because he doesn't pay for maintenance, insurance, or gas, and after multiple warnings, she decided to stop letting him use the car. He got angry, called her names, and accused her of holding grudges.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the financial aspect. The car is hers, and he's using it without contributing. Even if he's borrowing it, it's reasonable for him to cover the gas costs, especially for long trips. The fact that he took it multiple times and forgot to refill the tank each time shows a pattern of neglecting his responsibility. She warned him, which is fair, and when he didn't change his behavior, she took action by revoking his access to the car. That seems like a reasonable response to protect her own resources.\n\nThen there's the emotional aspect. He reacted negatively, calling her names and accusing her of being vindictive. That's disrespectful and suggests he's not taking her concerns seriously. The girlfriend's stance is about fairness and accountability. She's not being petty if he's consistently not meeting his responsibilities. She's also protecting her own interests, which is valid in a relationship where there's an imbalance in financial contributions.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of shared responsibility in a relationship. Even though the car is hers, since they live together and are in a committed relationship, there might be an expectation of shared expenses. However, since he's not contributing financially to the car in any way, his use of it without covering costs could be seen as unfair. The girlfriend's decision to stop allowing him to use the car is a direct response to his lack of responsibility.\n\nPossible counterarguments might suggest that he's using the car for family visits, which could be considered important. But that doesn't negate the financial responsibilities. If he values seeing his grandmother, he should cover the associated costs. The girlfriend isn't preventing him from seeing his family; she's stopping him from using her car without contributing.\n\nIn terms of fairness, she's given multiple warnings, which is reasonable. He didn't follow through, so revoking access is a logical step. His reaction is the issue here\u2014lashing out instead of addressing the problem constructively. The girlfriend's actions are about setting boundaries, which is healthy in a relationship. The boyfriend's behavior is inconsiderate and dismissive.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions are the problem, and the girlfriend is justified in her response. The answer should be B.\n"
