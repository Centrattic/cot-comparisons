I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about a couple where the boyfriend keeps borrowing the girl's car to visit his grandmother and other trips, but he never fills up the gas after using it, costing the girl money each time. The girl has warned him multiple times that if he continues, she'll stop letting him borrow the car. When he asks again, she revokes the permission, and he reacts angrily, accusing her of being juvenile and holding grudges.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author (the girl) is in the wrong. The key points are: the boyfriend uses the car without contributing to costs, despite repeated warnings. The car is hers, and he's not willing to pay for maintenance or insurance. The gas cost is significant each time, and he's not compensating her. \n\nThe boyfriend's behavior seems inconsiderate. He's using a shared resource (the car) without contributing financially, which is unfair. The girl is setting boundaries after multiple instances of being asked to cover the costs. She's given him chances to correct his behavior but he hasn't. Her reaction is to stop allowing him to borrow the car, which is a logical consequence. His anger towards her for enforcing the boundary suggests he's upset about losing the privilege he took for granted.\n\nThe question is whether she's in the wrong for revoking his access to the car. Since she owns the car, she has the right to set terms for its use. If those terms are not met, she's justified in taking away that privilege. The boyfriend's refusal to contribute and the repeated instances of not refilling gas show a pattern of disrespect towards her and her property. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
