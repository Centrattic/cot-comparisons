I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting her boyfriend visit his grandma because he keeps draining her gas without paying.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend and the author live together. He sold his car and now uses hers, but he refuses to contribute to the costs. Each time he takes the car, he uses all the gas and doesn't refill it. The author has warned him multiple times, and now he wants to take the car again for a weekend trip, so she said no. He reacted badly, calling her names.\n\nThe user's opinion is that the author isn't wrong. Let me break it down. The main issue is fairness in sharing costs. If he's using the car, especially for long trips, but isn't contributing to gas and maintenance, that's a problem. The author has a right to expect some responsibility, especially since she's covering all the expenses. The boyfriend's refusal to pay and his forgetfulness about refilling the tank show a lack of consideration.\n\nHe's had three instances already where he took the gas and didn't replace it. The author gave warnings, and he didn't change his behavior. Now she's revoking the privilege, which is a reasonable response after repeated issues. His reaction is defensive and blaming her, which doesn't sound fair. She's standing up for her own financial interests and boundaries.\n\nI think the author is justified in her actions. The boyfriend isn't respecting her property or her rules, so she's within her rights to stop him from using the car. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
