I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend borrowing the author's car repeatedly without contributing to gas or maintenance, even after warnings. The author finally refuses to let him borrow the car anymore, and he reacts angrily, accusing her of being vindictive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The car is the author's, fully paid for, and they live together. The boyfriend has borrowed the car three times for his grandma's visits, each time leaving it empty, costing the author $60 each time. He hasn't paid for maintenance, insurance, or gas. The author warned him multiple times, and when he didn't change his behavior, she took away the privilege. He got upset and blamed her.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, she owns the car and is paying all the expenses. It's reasonable for her to expect that if someone uses her car, they should contribute, especially since they live together. The boyfriend isn't contributing, despite being asked. The author is setting a boundary to protect her own resources. His reaction seems to be about not respecting her ownership and the costs involved. \n\nThe boyfriend's argument that it's not his car might be true, but he's using it and benefiting from it without contributing. The author's response is about enforcing the boundaries she set. So, I think the author is justified in her actions. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
