I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The main issue is about the boyfriend borrowing the car to visit his grandma and not refilling the gas each time, which costs the author money. The author has tried to warn him multiple times, but he keeps forgetting or not offering to pay. Now, after the latest incident, the author refuses to let him borrow the car anymore, leading to an argument where the boyfriend accuses her of being juvenile.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ownership of the car. The car is the author's, and she's paying for maintenance and insurance. The boyfriend isn't contributing, which is a point in her favor. Borrowing a car without contributing to its costs can be seen as taking something without responsibility. \n\nThen there's the gas issue. He uses the car and doesn't refill it, costing her $60 each time. He's had multiple chances to fix this but hasn't. The author's response is to stop him from borrowing the car, which is a reasonable action given his repeated failures to meet her expectations. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is also important. He accuses her of holding grudges and being vindictive, which might be a way to deflect responsibility. If he's not taking accountability for his actions, that's a red flag. The author isn't the one refusing to move on; she's trying to protect her property and finances.\n\nLooking at the relationship dynamics, the boyfriend sold his own car when he went back to university. That's his decision, but using someone else's car without contributing to costs seems unfair. The author has the right to set boundaries, especially when her property is involved. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the boyfriend isn't helping with the car expenses and isn't respecting her requests. The author is trying to communicate her needs, and when he doesn't comply, she adjusts her behavior. Her actions are a response to his lack of responsibility, which is justified. \n\nSo, putting this all together, the author's actions are reasonable. The boyfriend is not taking responsibility, and the author is protecting her own resources. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
