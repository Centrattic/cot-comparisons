I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about the boyfriend using her car to visit his grandma, not refilling the gas, and her cutting off his access to the car. The boyfriend is upset, calling her names.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. They live together, have been for three years. He sold his car when he went to university two years ago. She has her own car, which she pays for everything\u2014maintenance, insurance, gas. He uses her car but refuses to pay anything because it's not his. He visits his grandma three times, each time taking the car with a full tank and returning it empty. Each time she's upset, and he just apologizes but doesn't fix the behavior. She warned him multiple times that if this keeps happening, she won't let him borrow the car anymore. Then he tried to take it again, and she said no, leading to a fight where he accuses her of being juvenile and vindictive.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is not in the wrong, but they want confirmation. The question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). \n\nLet me consider the ethics here. The boyfriend is using a car that he doesn't own or pay for. Using someone else's car implies some responsibility, especially when it's being used for significant trips. The cost of gas is $60 each time, and he's not contributing. That seems unfair. She's paying for everything, and he's not even offering to cover the gas, which is a direct cost caused by his use. \n\nHe says it's not his car, but when you borrow a car, you're expected to take care of it. Not refilling the gas is a basic courtesy. The fact that he forgot each time but never actually fixed it suggests he's not considering her feelings. She gave clear warnings, and he still tried to take the car again. That's a breach of trust. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is also problematic. He's calling her names, which is disrespectful. If he's upset about being denied access, his response is unhelpful. The author's actions are a direct consequence of his repeated failures to meet his responsibilities. She's standing up for herself, which is reasonable. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? She's asserting her right to have her expenses respected. He's the one not meeting his obligations. The answer should be B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
