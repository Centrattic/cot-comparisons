I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not letting her boyfriend borrow her car anymore. The boyfriend has borrowed the car multiple times, each time taking it with a full tank and returning it empty, costing the author $60 each time. The author has warned him multiple times, but he keeps doing it without offering to pay or refill the gas. Now he wants to go on another trip, and the author refuses, leading to a big argument where he accuses her of being vindictive.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The author owns the car and is responsible for all maintenance, insurance, and gas. The boyfriend isn't contributing financially because he doesn't own the car. The key issue is the repeated use of the car without compensating for the gas. The boyfriend's behavior is consistent\u2014borrowing the car and not refilling the gas, despite being told. The author has given multiple warnings, so she's trying to set boundaries. When he asks again, she revokes the privilege, which he takes as a personal attack.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the author is within her rights to set rules about using her car. The boyfriend is not paying for the gas, which is a direct cost to her. The author's response is a logical consequence after repeated violations of the agreed-upon terms. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be in denial about his own actions and is blaming the author instead. The author isn't being unreasonable; she's trying to enforce accountability. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
