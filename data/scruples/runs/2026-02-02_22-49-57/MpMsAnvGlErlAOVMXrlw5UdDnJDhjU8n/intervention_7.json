I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the boyfriend keeps borrowing the car without refilling the gas or contributing to costs, and the author stops letting him borrow it. The boyfriend reacts angrily.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts. The couple lives together, they've been together three years. The boyfriend sold his car when he went back to university, so he relies on the author's car. The author is paying for maintenance, insurance, and gas. Each time he borrows the car, he takes it with a full tank and returns it empty, costing $60 each time. This has happened three times. The author has warned him multiple times, but he keeps forgetting to refill it. Now, the boyfriend wants to take it again for a day trip, and the author refuses, leading to an argument where the boyfriend accuses her of being juvenile and holding grudges.\n\nThe key points here are responsibility and fairness. The author is covering all the car expenses, and the boyfriend isn't contributing despite being asked. The boyfriend's actions are causing financial burden on the author. The author is trying to enforce a boundary, which seems reasonable given the repeated incidents. The boyfriend's reaction is defensive and dismissive, which might indicate he's not taking her concerns seriously.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, she's setting a boundary due to repeated irresponsibility. She's given warnings, and after the third time, she stops allowing him to borrow the car. That's a logical consequence. The boyfriend's behavior is inconsiderate, and his response is invalidating. So the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
