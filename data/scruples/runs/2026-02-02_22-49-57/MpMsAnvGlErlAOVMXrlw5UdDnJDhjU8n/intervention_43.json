I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the boyfriend is borrowing the car to visit his grandma, but he never fills the tank back up, and he refuses to contribute to the costs. The author has warned him multiple times, and now when he asks to borrow the car again, she says no, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The car is the author's, she's paying for maintenance and insurance. The boyfriend is borrowing it, using up gas, and not replenishing it. Each time it's a 3.5-hour trip, so maybe he's using a full tank each way? The cost is $60 per tank, and this has happened three times. The boyfriend keeps forgetting or ignoring to refill the gas. The author has given warnings, and now she's decided to stop letting him borrow the car. He reacts angrily, calling her names like juvenile and vindictive.\n\nThe author's main issue is fairness\u2014she's covering all the costs, and he's not contributing. The boyfriend's stance is that since the car isn't his, he doesn't have to pay. But logically, if you borrow something and use it, especially for a long trip, it's reasonable to expect you to return it in the same condition. Not refilling the gas when you know it's important to the owner is inconsiderate. The boyfriend's repeated neglect despite warnings shows a lack of respect for her property and her feelings.\n\nThe author's response was to stop allowing him to use the car, which seems like a reasonable consequence. He's not respecting her boundaries, and she's setting a boundary to protect her own interests. The boyfriend's reaction is out of proportion; he's blaming her for holding grudges when the issue is his consistent disregard for her rules. \n\nSo, in terms of right and wrong, the boyfriend is clearly at fault here. The author isn't in the wrong for standing up for herself and enforcing the rules she's set. The boyfriend's behavior is the problem, not her response to it.\n"
