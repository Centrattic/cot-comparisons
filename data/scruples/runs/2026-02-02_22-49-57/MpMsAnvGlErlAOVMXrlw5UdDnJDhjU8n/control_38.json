I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a boyfriend who uses the author's car to visit his grandma, but always returns it with an empty tank. The author is upset because they have to pay for gas and maintenance, and the boyfriend isn't contributing. The author finally refuses to let him borrow the car again, leading to an argument where the boyfriend accuses her of being unfair.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the main points. The boyfriend uses the car multiple times, each time leaving it with less gas, costing the author $60 each time. He's been warned multiple times but doesn't change his behavior. The author is justified in feeling that it's unfair to cover all costs when the car isn't even his. The boyfriend's response is to call her names and dismiss her concerns. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, if someone is using another's property and incurring costs, it's reasonable for the owner to expect some form of contribution or responsibility. The boyfriend is not paying for gas he uses, which is a direct expense. Even though the car isn't his, using it without considering the cost is inconsiderate. The author's response to stop allowing car use after repeated issues is a logical step to protect her own interests. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction, calling her juvenile and vindictive, suggests he's not acknowledging her valid concerns. This could indicate a pattern of disrespect towards her feelings. The author isn't being unreasonable; she's setting a boundary after multiple warnings. The boyfriend's behavior is the main issue here. He's not taking responsibility for the costs he's causing. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. She's standing up for herself when her partner isn't respecting her property and the financial agreement. The boyfriend's actions and reaction are the problems. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
