I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend borrowing her car to visit his grandma, but not refilling the gas each time, which the author is upset about. The boyfriend keeps borrowing it despite promises to do better, and the author finally takes away the car. The boyfriend gets angry, calling her names like juvenile and vindictive.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author owns the car, maintains it, and pays for insurance and maintenance. The boyfriend doesn't contribute to these costs. He borrows the car multiple times, each time taking it with a full tank and returning it empty. The cost is $60 each time for gas, which he doesn't pay. The author has warned him multiple times that if this continues, she won't let him borrow the car anymore. When he asks again, she refuses, leading to his outburst.\n\nSo, the main issue is financial responsibility and respect for the author's property. The boyfriend is using her car but not bearing any of the associated costs, which seems unfair. The author has given clear warnings, and after repeated offenses, she's taken action to stop the misuse. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be defensive, not recognizing that the problem is his repeated failure to follow through on his promises to refill the gas and pay for it. \n\nThe boyfriend might think that since he's not the owner, he's not responsible for those costs. However, when someone borrows something, it's customary to cover any direct costs incurred from their usage, like gas. The author is within her rights to set boundaries, especially since she's the one bearing all the expenses. His anger at her enforcing those boundaries suggests he's in the wrong for not respecting her property and the agreed terms.\n\nThe author's actions seem reasonable. She's given multiple chances, and after repeated issues, she's had to revoke the privilege. There's no indication that she's being unreasonable in her expectations. The boyfriend's outburst and the labels he uses (juvenile, vindictive) are more about deflecting responsibility than addressing the actual issue. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's behavior is the issue here. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
