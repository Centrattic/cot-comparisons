I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting her boyfriend visit his grandma because of his repeated behavior of using her car without refilling the gas or contributing to costs.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend uses her car multiple times, each time taking it with a full tank and returning it empty. Each trip costs $60 for gas, and he's done this three times. The author has warned him multiple times, but he keeps forgetting and doesn't offer to pay. She's now withholding the car, leading to an argument where he accuses her of being vindictive.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, she's covering all costs for a car she owns, including maintenance, insurance, and gas. The boyfriend isn't contributing financially, which seems unfair. She's given warnings and followed through with consequences when he didn't change his behavior. Her actions are in response to his repeated negligence, not an arbitrary decision.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is defensive and dismissive, calling her accusations childish. He doesn't take responsibility for his actions, which might indicate he's not aware of the financial impact or doesn't prioritize her concerns. However, his intent to visit his grandma is a personal need, and the author's refusal is affecting that.\n\nBut the key points are ownership and responsibility. The car is hers, so she has the right to set the terms for its use. His repeated failure to meet her conditions (returning with a full tank, no financial contribution) justifies her decision. While it's unfortunate that he can't visit his grandma, she's within her rights to enforce her boundaries. There's no indication she's being overly strict without cause. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
