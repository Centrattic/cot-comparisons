I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's boyfriend is borrowing her car to visit his grandma, but he's not refilling the gas each time. The car is the author's, who pays for maintenance, insurance, and gas. The boyfriend refuses to contribute because it's not his car. He's taken it three times for the 3.5-hour trip, each time using a full tank and returning it empty. Each time, the author is upset, but he just apologizes and forgets next time. The boyfriend also took it for other things without refilling. The author warned him that if this continues, he can't borrow the car anymore. Now he wants to take it again on a weekend when she's at work, and she says no. He gets mad, calling her juvenile and vindictive.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the responsibilities here. The car is the author's, and she's the one covering all expenses. The boyfriend is using her car without contributing financially, which seems unfair. He's supposed to be responsible for returning it with a full tank, but he doesn't. Each time, he uses a full tank and leaves it empty, costing $60 each time. Over three times, that's $180 out of her pocket. Plus, other times for other trips. The author has set boundaries, but he's not respecting them. She's taken the step to stop allowing him to borrow the car, which he's reacting negatively to.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, she's protecting her own property and expenses. She's given multiple warnings, so it's not like she's being unreasonable without prior communication. The boyfriend's response is to blame her for being vindictive, which is a deflection. The fact that he's using her car for personal visits without contributing seems to be the core issue. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries, especially since he's not respecting her terms. The boyfriend is in the wrong for not following through and for his negative reaction. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
