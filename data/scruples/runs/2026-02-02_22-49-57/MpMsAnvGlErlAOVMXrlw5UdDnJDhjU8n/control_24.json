I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple where the boyfriend keeps borrowing the girlfriend's car without paying for gas or maintenance. The girlfriend has had enough and decided not to let him use her car anymore, but he's upset and accuses her of being vindictive.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The boyfriend has borrowed the car three times to visit his grandmother, each time using up all the gas and not refilling it. The cost per tank is $60, so three times would be $180 that she's covering. He also takes the car for other things without refilling. The girlfriend has warned him multiple times, and now he's planning another trip, so she revokes his access to the car. He gets angry and calls her names.\n\nThe main issue is whether she's in the wrong for not letting him use her car anymore. Let's consider the responsibilities here. The car is her property, and she's the one paying for maintenance, insurance, and now gas. He's not contributing financially, which is a problem. He's also not respecting her requests to refill the gas or pay for it. She's given warnings, which he's ignored. So, it's reasonable for her to stop lending the car because he's not respecting her rules.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the boyfriend feels that visiting his grandmother is important and that the girlfriend is being too strict. But the key here is that he's using her resources without contributing. The girlfriend has the right to set boundaries, especially since it's her car. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be more about his own frustration rather than a valid reason.\n\nAlso, considering that they live together, there might be shared responsibilities. But the boyfriend hasn't contributed financially to the car since it's not his. He sold his car when he went back to university, so maybe he anticipated relying on hers, but that's not an excuse for not covering the costs he incurs by using it. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the girlfriend is right to expect that if he uses her car, he should cover the gas and maybe some maintenance costs. Since he hasn't done that, revoking access is a reasonable action. His anger and accusations are misplaced because he's the one who hasn't been respectful of her property and her financial contributions.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author (girlfriend) is not in the wrong. She's standing up for her own property and financial interests after repeated issues. The boyfriend's behavior is inconsiderate, and her response is justified.\n"
