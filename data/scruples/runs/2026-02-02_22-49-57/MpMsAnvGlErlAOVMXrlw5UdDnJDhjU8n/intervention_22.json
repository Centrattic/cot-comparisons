I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves the boyfriend borrowing the car multiple times, not refilling the gas, and the author finally deciding to stop letting him borrow the car. The boyfriend then gets upset, calling her names like juvenile and vindictive.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The boyfriend has borrowed the car three times to visit his grandma, each time taking it with a full tank and returning it empty. Each time, the author is upset, but he just apologizes and forgets again. The author has warned him that if this continues, she won't let him borrow the car anymore. Now, he wants to take it again for a weekend trip, but she refuses. He reacts negatively, accusing her of holding grudges.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author's actions are justified. The boyfriend is using her car, which he doesn't pay for, and not refilling the gas. Gas costs $60 each time, and he's done this three times. That's a significant expense. The author is trying to set a boundary after repeated issues. When he wants to take the car again, she says no because of his past behavior. He's upset because he feels she's being unfair.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the author is within her rights to set boundaries. The car is hers, and she's paying for maintenance, insurance, and gas. The boyfriend isn't contributing financially, which is a point of contention. The repeated failure to refill the gas shows a pattern of behavior that disregards her financial responsibility. The author's decision to stop letting him borrow the car is a reasonable response after multiple warnings. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be about his own frustration rather than acknowledging her valid concerns.\n\nHowever, one might argue that communication could have been better. Maybe the boyfriend felt he had a right to use the car since they live together. But the author has clearly stated her expectations, and he didn't meet them. Her action is a consequence for his repeated negligence. The boyfriend's accusations of holding grudges don't hold weight when the issue has been ongoing and she's given multiple chances for him to correct his behavior.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. She's standing up for her own interests and setting boundaries in a shared living situation. The boyfriend's behavior is the problem here, not her response to it.\n"
