I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation (AITA) is in the wrong. The scenario involves a boyfriend who uses the author's car to visit his grandmother, but each time he returns it with an empty tank. The author is upset because she has to pay for gas and maintenance, and the boyfriend isn't contributing financially. After multiple warnings, the author decides to stop letting him use the car, leading to an argument where the boyfriend accuses her of being juvenile.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The boyfriend is using the car without contributing to the costs. The author has a valid complaint about fairness since she's the one paying for everything. The boyfriend's repeated failures to refill the tank despite warnings are problematic. When the author finally refuses, he reacts negatively, which might indicate he's not taking her concerns seriously.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is wrong for stopping him from using the car. From a fairness standpoint, if someone uses another person's property and doesn't cover the associated costs, it's reasonable to expect them to contribute. The boyfriend's refusal to pay for gas and the author's maintenance and insurance costs isn't fair. The boyfriend's dismissive attitude and lack of follow-through on promises to refill the tank further justify the author's actions.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction\u2014calling her juvenile and using old grudges\u2014might be a deflection. The author's response is a boundary set after repeated issues, which is a reasonable action to protect her own resources. There's no indication that the author is being unreasonable beyond the point of the repeated violations of agreed-upon terms.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. She's asserting her right to have her property respected and her costs covered. The boyfriend's behavior is the issue here, not hers.\n"
