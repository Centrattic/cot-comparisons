I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the boyfriend is borrowing the car to visit his grandma, but each time he takes it with a full tank and returns it empty. The author is upset because they have to pay for gas and maintenance, and the boyfriend refuses to contribute. The author finally said no to borrowing the car again, and the boyfriend got angry, calling her names like juvenile and vindictive.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The boyfriend is using the car without contributing to costs. The author is covering all expenses, including gas, maintenance, and insurance. The boyfriend has been warned multiple times but keeps not refilling the tank. Now, when he wants to take the car again, the author refuses, and he's upset. \n\nThe main issue here is financial responsibility and communication. The author is within her rights to set boundaries, especially since the car isn't his and he's not contributing. The boyfriend's behavior seems inconsiderate. He uses the car without covering the costs, even after being told. The author's response is a reasonable way to enforce the boundary she's set. The boyfriend's reaction of anger and name-calling points to his defensiveness and possible lack of accountability. \n\nIn relationships, especially when sharing resources, it's important to have mutual respect and responsibility. The boyfriend isn't respecting her financial contributions by not paying for the gas he uses. The author's decision to stop lending the car is a valid choice to protect her own interests. The boyfriend's outburst suggests he's not taking her concerns seriously, which might indicate a deeper issue in their communication. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong here. She's standing up for herself and her financial well-being. The boyfriend's actions and reaction are what's problematic. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
