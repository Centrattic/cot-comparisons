I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. Let me read through the details carefully.\n\nThe author's boyfriend has borrowed her car multiple times to visit his grandmother, which is 3.5 hours away. Each time, he takes it with a full tank and returns it empty, costing her $60 each time. He's done this three times and other trips too, never refilling the tank or contributing to the cost. The author has warned him multiple times that if this continues, she'll stop letting him borrow the car. When he tried to take it again, she refused, and he got angry, calling her names like juvenile and vindictive. The question is whether she's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the financial aspect. The car is hers, and she's responsible for maintenance, insurance, and gas. The boyfriend isn't contributing to any of these costs, which seems unfair. It's her car, so she should have the right to set the terms for its use. If he borrows it, it's reasonable to expect him to cover the additional expenses incurred, like gas for the trip. Not paying for the gas he uses is a valid point against him.\n\nThen there's the communication issue. She's given multiple warnings, but he hasn't changed his behavior. That suggests he's not taking her concerns seriously. When he tried to take the car again, she rightfully enforced her rule by not allowing it. His reaction of anger and calling her names is inappropriate. She's standing up for her own property and financial boundaries, which is her right.\n\nThe boyfriend's argument that it's not his car is weak because he's using it and should share the costs. The fact that he can't even remember to refill the gas despite multiple reminders shows a lack of consideration. The author is protecting her own interests, which is reasonable. There's no indication that she's being unreasonable beyond setting clear boundaries.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. She's justified in not letting him borrow the car anymore, given his repeated failure to meet her conditions. Her boyfriend's behavior is the issue here.\n"
