I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple where the boyfriend is borrowing the girlfriend's car to visit his grandmother, but not refilling the gas each time, costing the girlfriend $60 each trip. The boyfriend refuses to pay for the car's maintenance and insurance since it's not his car. The girlfriend has warned him multiple times, but he keeps forgetting or not offering to refill the gas. Now, when he wants to use the car again, she's refusing because he's not respecting her boundaries.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The car is hers, so she's responsible for all expenses. He's using it without contributing, which is a problem. The boyfriend isn't taking her warnings seriously, even after multiple instances. He's also dismissing her concerns as being juvenile, which is a poor reaction. The girlfriend is trying to set boundaries to protect her own resources, which is reasonable. \n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's property and shared responsibilities is important. Since he's using her car, it's fair to expect him to cover associated costs, especially if it's for his personal trips. His refusal to pay and not refilling the gas is a breach of that understanding. The girlfriend's response of revoking the privilege after repeated warnings is a logical step to enforce her boundaries. The boyfriend's anger and accusations of holding grudges seem unfounded because she's standing up for her own financial interests. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions and reactions are the main issues here. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
