I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post (AITA) is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend who repeatedly borrows the author's car, uses all the gas without refilling, and the author decides to stop letting him borrow the car. The boyfriend gets upset and accuses her of being vindictive.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend isn't contributing to the car's maintenance or insurance. He's only borrowing it without covering the costs. Each time he uses it, he drains the gas tank, which costs $60 each way. That's a total of $180 over three trips. The author has warned him multiple times, but he keeps doing it. \n\nThe author's decision to stop allowing him to borrow the car seems reasonable because he's not respecting her rules. The boyfriend's reaction is also problematic\u2014he's calling her names like juvenile and vindictive, which is a common deflection tactic. He's not taking responsibility for his actions, which is a red flag. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author has a right to set boundaries regarding her car. The boyfriend's repeated negligence and refusal to compensate for the gas he uses is a breach of trust. The fact that he's using the car for long trips (3.5 hours) and not refilling the tank suggests he's not considering her financial burden. The author's actions are a direct response to his lack of responsibility. \n\nSo, the boyfriend isn't in the right here. The author isn't wrong for enforcing her boundaries. The answer should be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
