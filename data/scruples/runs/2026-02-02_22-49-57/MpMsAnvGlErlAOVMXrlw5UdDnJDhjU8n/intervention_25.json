I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend who borrows his partner's car to visit his grandmother, but each time he returns it with an empty tank. The partner is upset because she's paying for gas and maintenance, and he's not contributing. She's told him multiple times that if he keeps doing this, she'll stop letting him borrow the car. When he asks again, she says no, and he gets angry, accusing her of being vindictive.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate both sides. The woman's car is her responsibility, and she's clearly stated her boundaries. The boyfriend isn't contributing to the costs of the car or gas, which is a valid concern. He's supposed to return the car full but doesn't, leading to recurring issues. The woman had warned him, and he kept doing it. Her decision to stop letting him borrow the car is a logical consequence of him not respecting her boundaries. \n\nOn the other hand, the boyfriend might feel that visiting his grandmother is important and that he's only using the car when needed. However, he still has a responsibility to maintain the car's fuel level and respect her rules. His reaction of calling her names and being disrespectful is problematic. \n\nThe key points here are about respecting boundaries and responsibility. The woman is within her rights to set these boundaries, especially since she's the one covering all expenses. The boyfriend's actions are inconsiderate, and her response is a reasonable consequence. There's no indication she's being unreasonable beyond the agreed-upon terms. Therefore, the woman is not in the wrong here.\n"
