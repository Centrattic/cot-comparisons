I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the person who wrote this (the author) is in the wrong for not letting her boyfriend visit his grandma because he keeps draining her gas and not paying for it. \n\nFirst, let me recap the situation. The boyfriend and author have been together three years and live together. He sold his car when he went back to university two years ago. The author has her own small car, which she just paid off but still maintains and insures. The boyfriend refuses to pay for maintenance or insurance because \"it's not his car.\" \n\nHis grandma lives 3.5 hours away. He's borrowed the car a few times to visit her, each time taking it with a full tank and returning it empty. Each trip uses a full tank, which costs $60. He's done this three times, and each time she gets upset, but he just says sorry and forgets next time. The author has warned him that if he keeps doing this, she won't let him borrow the car anymore. Now, he wants to take it again for a weekend trip, but she says no. He got angry, calling her juvenile and vindictive, bringing up old stuff.\n\nSo the main issue is whether the author is justified in her actions. Let me think about the key points here. \n\nFirst, the boyfriend is using her car, which he doesn't own. He's not contributing to the costs of the car (maintenance, insurance) and isn't paying for gas. Even though he's borrowing it, he's using it for his own purposes, which is a long trip. The cost of gas each time is significant, $60 per tank, and he does this three times. That's $180 total, which adds up. If he's not paying for that, especially since he's not contributing to the car's maintenance and insurance, it's unfair.\n\nThe boyfriend's behavior is a pattern. He's not taking responsibility for the costs associated with using the car. The author has warned him multiple times, but he ignores her. Then, when she finally enforces her boundary, he gets upset and accuses her of being vindictive. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, if someone borrows something, especially something as expensive and essential as a car, they should be responsible for the costs incurred. Even if it's a borrowed item, using it for your own benefit (like visiting family) without contributing to the expenses is not fair. The boyfriend's refusal to pay for gas, despite the author's repeated requests, shows a lack of respect for her financial contributions.\n\nMoreover, the author's response is to stop allowing him to use the car. This is a logical consequence for his repeated failure to comply with her conditions. The boyfriend's anger and accusations suggest that he doesn't see his actions as problematic, which is part of the issue. He's not taking responsibility and is instead blaming her for holding a grudge, which isn't the case here\u2014she's enforcing a boundary she's set.\n\nAnother angle is that the boyfriend sold his own car, so he's reliant on her car. If he needs to travel frequently, perhaps he should consider purchasing a car himself or finding alternative transportation. But since he's using her car, he should cover the associated costs. The fact that he doesn't pay for gas is a major point against his argument. \n\nThe author's maintenance of her car is her responsibility, and she's not being cruel; she's setting a boundary. The boyfriend's response\u2014calling her names and bringing up old issues\u2014suggests he's deflecting the real problem here. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. She's standing up for her boundaries and the financial responsibilities. The boyfriend's behavior is inconsiderate and disrespectful. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
