I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend and girlfriend living together. The main issue is that the boyfriend borrows the girl's car to visit his grandma, comes back with an empty tank, and the girl feels it's unfair because she has to pay for gas and maintenance. She's told him multiple times and eventually stops letting him borrow the car. He gets angry and accuses her of being vindictive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The car is hers, and he's using it without contributing. Each time he takes it, he uses up gas which costs $60 per tank. She's paid for the car, maintenance, insurance, etc., and he's not helping. He says it's not his car, so he won't contribute. The girl is trying to set boundaries, which is her right as the car owner. He's not respecting her rules, leading her to revoke his permission. He reacts poorly, calling her names. \n\nSo, from a fairness standpoint, the boyfriend isn't contributing to the costs he's incurring by using the car. The girl has every right to set conditions for borrowing her car. If he's not following the rules (returning it with a full tank, contributing to costs), then it's reasonable for her to stop allowing him to use it. His reaction suggests he doesn't acknowledge her ownership and financial responsibility, which is problematic.\n\nThe boyfriend's refusal to pay for gas is an issue. Even if it's not his car, using someone else's property and incurring costs without contributing is unfair. The girl is being responsible by setting limits. She's given multiple warnings, and when he doesn't comply, she takes action. The boyfriend's anger and accusations seem unjustified here. He's the one violating agreed-upon terms, and he's blaming her for being vindictive, which is a classic example of gaslighting or deflecting blame.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author (girl) is protecting her own financial interests and setting boundaries, which is her right. The boyfriend is not respecting those boundaries and is acting out. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
