I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a boyfriend who's been borrowing the author's car without contributing to gas or maintenance costs. The boyfriend takes the car to visit his grandma, using up gas each time and not refilling it. The author has given warnings but the boyfriend isn't changing his behavior. Then, when the author finally revokes the car access, the boyfriend gets angry and calls her names. The user wants to know if the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. The boyfriend has borrowed the car multiple times, each time leaving it empty. The author pays for gas and maintenance. The boyfriend refuses to contribute because it's not his car. The author has warned him multiple times, but he ignores it. Then, when she stops allowing him to borrow the car, he becomes upset. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the author is covering all the costs of the car, including gas, which is a significant expense each time he uses it. The boyfriend isn't contributing, even though he benefits from using the car. This seems like an imbalance. The author's actions in revoking the privilege after repeated warnings might be justified as self-preservation. The boyfriend's reaction of anger and calling her names seems to be blaming her for his own irresponsibility. \n\nThe boyfriend's refusal to pay for gas despite being asked is problematic. The author is within her rights to set boundaries. By not respecting those boundaries, the boyfriend is in the wrong. The author's response is a reasonable consequence after repeated infractions. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
