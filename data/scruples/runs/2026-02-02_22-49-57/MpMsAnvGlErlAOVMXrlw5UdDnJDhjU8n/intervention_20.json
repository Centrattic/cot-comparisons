I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's boyfriend repeatedly borrows her car to visit his grandma, uses all the gas, and never pays for it. The author has given multiple warnings and finally decided to stop letting him borrow the car. The boyfriend got upset, calling her names like juvenile and vindictive.\n\nFirst, the key points here are about fairness and responsibility. The boyfriend is using the author's car and resources (gas) without contributing financially. Even though the car isn't his, he's benefiting from it, which the author is covering all costs for. The author has tried to communicate her boundaries multiple times, which is reasonable. When those boundaries aren't respected, she takes action by revoking the privilege. The boyfriend's reaction seems to be dismissive and accusatory, which doesn't help resolve the issue.\n\nThe boyfriend's argument that he \"forgot\" and will remember next time doesn't address the recurring problem. If he truly wanted to respect her boundaries, he would either pay for the gas or not borrow the car. His repeated neglect to do so shows a lack of consideration for the author's financial responsibility.\n\nThe author's decision to stop allowing car use is a logical consequence after multiple warnings. She's not being vindictive; she's protecting her own resources. The boyfriend's reaction, labeling her as such, is an attempt to shift blame rather than take responsibility for his actions. \n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's property and financial boundaries is crucial. The author is standing up for her rights here, and the boyfriend isn't meeting her halfway. There's no indication that the author is being unreasonable beyond her established limits. So, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
