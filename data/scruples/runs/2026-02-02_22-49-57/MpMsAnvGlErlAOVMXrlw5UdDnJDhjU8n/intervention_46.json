I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting her boyfriend visit his grandma because he keeps using her car without refueling or contributing to expenses.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend is in a three-year relationship, living together. He sold his car when he went back to university two years ago, so he relies on her car. But he refuses to pay for maintenance or insurance since it's not his car. That's already a point of contention.\n\nHe visits his grandma three times, each time taking the car full and returning it empty, costing $60 each time. She's upset about the gas costs. He keeps saying sorry but doesn't follow through. She's given warnings, and now he wants to use the car again, so she revokes the privilege. He reacts badly, calling her names like juvenile and vindictive.\n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong. So, is she right? Let's see. The boyfriend is using the car but not contributing to the costs. Common sense says if you borrow something, you should cover the expenses. But he's not doing that. The author is setting boundaries after multiple warnings. He's not respecting her feelings, which is a problem. His reaction is out of proportion and dismissive of her valid concerns. So the author is standing up for herself, which is reasonable. The boyfriend's behavior is inconsiderate and disrespectful. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
