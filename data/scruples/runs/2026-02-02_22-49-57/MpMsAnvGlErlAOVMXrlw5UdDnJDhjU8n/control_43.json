I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting her boyfriend visit his grandma because he keeps draining her car's gas without refilling it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been together for three years and live together. The boyfriend sold his car when he went back to university. The author owns a small car, pays for maintenance, insurance, and gas. The boyfriend refuses to contribute to the car's costs because it's not his. He visits his grandma, who's 3.5 hours away, and each time he borrows the car, uses a full tank, and returns it empty. The cost per tank is $60, and this has happened three times. The author is upset because she feels it's unfair. She warned him multiple times that if this continues, she won't let him borrow the car. He then tried to take it again for a weekend visit, leading to an argument where he accused her of being vindictive.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. \n\nThe key points are:\n1. Shared living situation: They live together, which might imply some shared responsibilities, but the car is her personal property.\n2. Financial contribution: The boyfriend isn't paying for the car's maintenance, insurance, or gas. He refuses to contribute because it's not his car.\n3. Repeated incidents: He's borrowed the car three times, each time using up gas without refilling. Despite warnings, he hasn't changed his behavior.\n4. The author's response: She decided to stop letting him borrow the car, leading to his anger and accusations against her.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if the boyfriend is using the car for his personal visits (to his grandma) and not contributing financially, the author has a right to set boundaries. She's made clear that his actions are causing her financial burden, and she's enforced a rule after multiple warnings. His reaction\u2014calling her names and dismissing her concerns\u2014suggests he's not taking her feelings seriously.\n\nLegally and ethically, the car is the author's, so she has the right to decide who can use it and under what conditions. The boyfriend's refusal to contribute to the costs when he uses the car is a problem. Even though they live together, unless there's a shared agreement to cover each other's expenses, she isn't obligated to cover his travel costs.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the boyfriend believes that in a relationship, partners should support each other's families, so visiting grandma is a valid reason. However, the author is not stopping him from visiting; she's stopping him from using her car without contributing. If he can't afford to refill the tank or pay for the gas, that's his responsibility. The author isn't at fault for enforcing her boundaries after repeated issues.\n\nAnother angle: The boyfriend's behavior might be neglectful or disrespectful. He's been warned and still didn't change, leading to the author taking action. Her response seems reasonable as she's protecting her property and financial interests.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is justified in her actions. The boyfriend is at fault for not respecting her property and financial boundaries. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
