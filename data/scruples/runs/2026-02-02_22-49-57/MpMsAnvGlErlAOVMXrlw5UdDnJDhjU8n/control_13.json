I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The main issue is about the boyfriend not paying for gas when he borrows the car. The boyfriend lives with her, they've been together three years, and he sold his car to go back to university. She has her own car, pays for everything. He refuses to contribute because it's not his car. He borrows it to visit his grandma 3.5 hours away, takes it with a full tank and returns it empty, costing her $60 each time. She's been upset each time, he apologizes but doesn't change. She warned him multiple times that if he keeps doing this, she'll stop letting him borrow the car. Now he wants to take it again, and she said no. He's angry, calling her names.\n\nSo the question is, is she in the wrong? Let's break it down. The boyfriend is using her car but not contributing to the costs. In a relationship, shared responsibilities and fairness matter. If he's using the car for his purposes, it's reasonable to expect him to cover the gas. She's made her stance clear and followed through when he didn't comply. He's not taking responsibility, even after warnings. Her actions were a result of him not respecting her boundaries. He's the one not contributing, so she's within her rights to stop lending the car. The boyfriend's reaction is over the top and he's not owning up to his part. So the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
