I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not letting her boyfriend visit his grandma by using her car. The boyfriend has borrowed the car multiple times, each time taking it with a full tank and returning it empty, costing the author $60 each time. He's been told multiple times that this isn't acceptable and not to do it again, but he keeps forgetting to refill it. Now he wants to take the car again, and the author refuses, leading to an argument where he accuses her of being juvenile, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the fairness of the situation. The car is the author's, and she's paying for maintenance and insurance. The boyfriend isn't contributing to these costs, which already seems like an issue. When he borrows it, he's using her resources, so it's reasonable for her to expect that he covers the gas used for his trips. If he consistently takes the gas without reimbursement, that's a financial burden on her. The fact that he \"forgets\" to refill it after each trip, despite warnings, suggests a pattern of irresponsibility or disrespect towards her property and her money.\n\nThe author's response is to revoke the car borrowing privilege. Is that justified? If he keeps using the car without taking responsibility for the gas, she has a right to protect her own interests. The boyfriend's reaction, calling her juvenile and vindictive, might be his way of deflecting. It's important to note that the author gave multiple warnings first, which is a reasonable step before cutting off access. His repeated failure to comply without valid reason could be seen as his fault, not hers.\n\nAlso, the fact that the car can make the trip on a single tank and he uses it both ways might mean he's using more gas than necessary. Even if he's careful, the cost is still on her. In a shared living situation, splitting costs for shared resources is typical. Since he's borrowing the car for his own needs, expecting him to cover the associated expenses is fair.\n\nThe boyfriend's argument that he's sorry but doesn't follow through shows a lack of accountability. The author is within her rights to set boundaries, especially when her partner isn't respecting them. The accusations she's facing from him are likely attempts to make her feel guilty, which is a common tactic in such disagreements.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. She's trying to maintain fairness and has communicated her expectations clearly. The boyfriend's behavior is the issue here, not her response. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
