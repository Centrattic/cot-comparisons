I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the boyfriend not paying for gas when borrowing the car, leading to the author restricting his access.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend uses the car three times for his grandma's visits, each time taking it with a full tank and returning empty. Each trip costs $60 for gas. The author is upset because she's paying all for the car's maintenance, insurance, and now the gas. The boyfriend refuses to pay anything, saying it's not his car. He forgets to refill the gas each time and doesn't offer to pay. The author warns him multiple times, but he doesn't change his behavior. Then she decides to stop letting him borrow the car, which makes him angry, calling her names like juvenile and vindictive.\n\nSo, who's in the wrong? The key points here are responsibility and mutual respect. The author is covering all car costs, including the gas he uses. The boyfriend isn't contributing, even after being asked. He's not taking the warnings seriously. The author's right to set boundaries because it's her car. The boyfriend's reaction is also problematic\u2014he's dismissive and not taking responsibility. \n\nThe author is within her rights to set rules for her own property. She's tried to reason logically and gave multiple chances. The boyfriend's behavior is inconsiderate and disrespectful. So the answer here should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
