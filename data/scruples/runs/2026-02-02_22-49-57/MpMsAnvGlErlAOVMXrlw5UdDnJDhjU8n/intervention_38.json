I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. Let's look at the details.\n\nThe boyfriend and the author live together. The boyfriend sold his car when he went back to university two years ago. Now, the author has a small car that she's paying for\u2014maintenance, insurance, and gas. The boyfriend borrows the car to visit his grandma, who's 3.5 hours away. He takes it with a full tank but returns it empty. Each trip costs $60 in gas, and this has happened three times. The author is upset because she's paying for all this, and he doesn't contribute. He apologizes each time but doesn't fix the problem. The author has warned him multiple times that if he keeps doing this, she won't let him borrow the car anymore. Then, when he asks to go for a day trip, she denies him, and he gets angry, calling her names and accusing her of holding grudges.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend is using the author's car without contributing to the costs. Even though it's not his car, he's benefiting from using it. The cost of gas for each trip is $60, which adds up. The author is clearly frustrated because she's not getting any help with expenses. The boyfriend's response\u2014apologizing but not changing his behavior\u2014suggests he's not taking her concerns seriously. The author's decision to stop letting him borrow the car seems like a reasonable boundary after repeated requests and warnings. The boyfriend's reaction is over the top; he's angry at her for enforcing a rule he agreed to. \n\nIs the author being unfair by not letting him borrow the car? She's the owner, so she has the right to set terms. He's not willing to pay for the gas, which is a valid point. She's trying to maintain fairness and is being consistent with her warnings. His disrespect and not following through on apologies show a lack of consideration. The author's actions seem justified. So, the answer should be B\u2014she's not in the wrong.\n"
