I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about a boyfriend who's been borrowing his partner's car to visit his grandma and other things, but never refills the gas or contributes to the costs. The partner has a small car, just paid it off, and is responsible for maintenance and insurance. The boyfriend refuses to pay anything because \"it's not his car.\" The partner warned him multiple times about the gas, but he kept doing it. Now, when the boyfriend wants to take the car again, the partner says no, leading to an argument where the boyfriend accuses her of being vindictive.\n\nFirst, considering fairness: the boyfriend is using a car that's not his, which the partner is paying for. Each time he takes it, he uses up all the gas, costing $60 each trip. Three times already. The partner isn't asking for money, just that he refills the tank. But he doesn't. The partner gives warnings, but he ignores them. Then when she takes away the car, he gets angry and calls her names. \n\nLegally, maybe the boyfriend's not at fault if it's her car. But morally, he's using a resource he's not contributing to. The partner is within her rights to set boundaries. She's been patient, given multiple chances, but he didn't respect her wishes. Her decision to stop letting him use the car is a reasonable response to his repeated disregard for her rules. His reaction seems immature and dismissive. \n\nSo the question is whether the author is wrong. The boyfriend's behavior is the problem here. He's using her car without contributing, ignoring her requests. The author's response is about protecting her own property and costs. She's not in the wrong for standing up for her boundaries after multiple violations. The answer should be B (No).\n"
