I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. So the author is a girlfriend who's upset because her boyfriend keeps borrowing her car to visit his grandma and not refilling the gas. The boyfriend doesn't contribute to the car's costs, which she's paying for. She's told him multiple times that if he keeps doing this, she'll stop letting him borrow the car. He then wanted to take it again, and she said no, which made him angry, calling her names like juvenile and vindictive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The boyfriend is using her car for his own purposes (visiting grandma) and not contributing to the expenses. Even though she's given him warnings and he's not changed his behavior, she's taking away the car privilege. The boyfriend is upset and thinks she's wrong for doing that.\n\nThe main issue here is about consent and shared responsibility. Since they live together, you might expect some shared responsibilities. However, the car is hers, and she's the one paying for all the costs. The boyfriend isn't contributing to the car's maintenance, insurance, or gas. So when he borrows the car, using gas which he doesn't replenish, that's adding to her expenses without her consent. \n\nShe's given him multiple chances and clear warnings. He's not complying. Then when she takes away the car access, he's upset. From a fairness perspective, it's reasonable for her to set boundaries. If someone uses your property repeatedly without covering the costs and then gets angry when you enforce rules, that's a problem. The boyfriend isn't respecting her property or her financial contributions. So her response seems justified. \n\nAnother angle could be whether the boyfriend's use of the car is legitimate. Visiting family might be seen as a valid reason, but that doesn't mean the person has to cover all the costs. Since the car isn't his, he can't assume responsibility for the gas. The fact that he's using it for personal trips without contributing to the expenses is where the issue lies. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction of calling her names suggests he's not taking responsibility for his actions. Instead of acknowledging the problem, he's blaming her. That's a red flag. The author is standing up for her own interests, which is reasonable. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. She's protecting her property and financial well-being by setting clear boundaries after repeated violations. The boyfriend's behavior is inconsiderate and disrespectful, so the blame isn't on her. Answer B.\n"
