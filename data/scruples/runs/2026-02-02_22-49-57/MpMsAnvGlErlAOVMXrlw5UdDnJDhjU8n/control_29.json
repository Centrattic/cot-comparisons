I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a boyfriend using the author's car to visit his grandmother and not refilling the gas each time, costing the author money. The boyfriend refuses to pay for maintenance or insurance and only apologizes without fixing the issue. The author eventually stops letting him use the car, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The boyfriend is using the car, which isn't his, and not replenishing the gas. Each time, he takes a full tank and returns it empty. The cost adds up, and the author feels it's unfair. The boyfriend's response is dismissive, saying he'll remember next time but doesn't. The author has given warnings, and after continued behavior, she revokes the privilege. He reacts angrily, calling her names.\n\nLegally and morally, when someone borrows a car, they're typically expected to cover the costs of fuel, especially if it's a significant expense. The boyfriend's refusal to contribute to the car's expenses (maintenance, insurance) and not reimbursing for gas makes the situation unfair. The author is setting boundaries, which is reasonable. The boyfriend's reaction seems out of line, as he's the one not respecting her property and finances.\n\nThe key points are: repeated failure to refill gas, refusal to pay for car-related costs, and the author taking action after multiple warnings. The boyfriend's behavior is inconsiderate and disrespectful. The author's response is a direct consequence of his actions. There's no indication she's overreacting; she's trying to protect her own financial interests. Therefore, the boyfriend is in the wrong, and the author is justified in her actions.\n"
