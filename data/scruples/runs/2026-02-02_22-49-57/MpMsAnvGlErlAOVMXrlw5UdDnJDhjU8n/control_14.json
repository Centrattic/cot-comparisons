I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a boyfriend who borrows his girlfriend's car to visit his grandma, but doesn't pay for gas and leaves the tank empty each time. The girlfriend finally says no, and the boyfriend accuses her of being vindictive. The user wants to know if the author (the girlfriend) is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The car is hers, she maintains and pays for it. The boyfriend uses it multiple times, each time draining the gas without refilling or contributing. She's asked him multiple times, even given warnings. He's been dismissive each time. So she decides to stop letting him borrow the car. He reacts negatively, calling her names. \n\nNow, is she in the wrong? Well, the car is her property. He's using it without contributing, which is a financial burden. She's tried to communicate and set boundaries. He didn't respect those boundaries. Her decision to stop letting him use the car is a reasonable response after repeated issues. His reaction of being upset and accusing her seems inappropriate. \n\nBut maybe there's a different angle. Could he have felt that visiting his grandma is a valid reason? But the problem is his lack of responsibility in maintaining the car's gas and financial aspects. If he's supposed to be a partner, contributing to shared expenses or at least his own use makes sense. Since he's living together, even if the car is hers, shared responsibilities might be implied, especially since they live together. \n\nThe boyfriend's behavior is inconsiderate and inconsiderate of her financial contributions. The girlfriend is protecting her own property and setting a boundary after many warnings. The boyfriend's loss of temper and accusations are likely because he didn't take responsibility. \n\nSo the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). She's within her rights to set boundaries regarding her property. The boyfriend's actions and reactions are the issue here.\n"
