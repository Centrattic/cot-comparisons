I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple living together, and the boyfriend borrowing the girlfriend's car without contributing to the costs. The main issue is the boyfriend not refueling the car after using it, leading to the girlfriend cutting him off from borrowing the car again.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both sides. The girlfriend has a car she pays for, including insurance and maintenance. The boyfriend uses it multiple times, each time taking it with a full tank and returning it empty, costing her $60 each time. She's warned him several times, but he doesn't change his behavior. Then, when she revokes his access, he gets angry and calls her names.\n\nFrom the girlfriend's perspective, she's bearing the financial burden of the car and its usage. The boyfriend isn't contributing, even though he benefits from using the car. She's given him multiple chances, and he hasn't honored his promises to refill the tank. Her decision to stop allowing him to borrow the car is a response to his repeated negligence. Her actions seem reasonable as she's trying to protect her finances and set boundaries.\n\nOn the boyfriend's side, he might feel that since the car isn't his, he isn't responsible for the costs. However, by using the car, he's benefiting from it, so it's fair to expect some contribution or at least refilling the tank. His reaction of anger and calling her names suggests he's not taking responsibility for his actions, which could indicate that he's in the wrong.\n\nThe key points are: shared living responsibilities, financial contributions, and respecting boundaries. The boyfriend isn't contributing to the costs despite using the car, leading to repeated issues. The girlfriend is trying to enforce accountability, which is justified. The boyfriend's refusal to change his behavior and his hostile reaction make him the one at fault here.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The girlfriend isn't at fault for protecting her own property and financial interests. The boyfriend's actions are the issue, not her response to them.\n"
