I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is wrong in this situation. The boyfriend uses the author's car, which they've paid for, including gas and insurance. Each time he borrowed the car, he returned it with an empty tank, costing around $60 each time. The author has warned him multiple times, but he keeps doing it. Now the boyfriend got upset when the author said he couldn't borrow the car anymore.\n\nFirst, the author isn't obligated to let him use the car. It's their car, and they've maintained it themselves. The boyfriend isn't contributing financially, which seems unfair. The repeated behavior of not refilling the gas despite warnings is a problem. The boyfriend's reaction was to call the author names, which shows a lack of responsibility and understanding.\n\nThe key points here are ownership and responsibility. The author has the right to set boundaries. The boyfriend's actions are inconsiderate, and the author is enforcing those boundaries. There's no indication the author is being unreasonable; they've given warnings and the situation escalated. So the answer should be B, the author isn't wrong.\n"
