I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The main issue here is about the boyfriend using the author's car multiple times, draining the gas without refilling, and not contributing to costs, even though they live together. The author has set a boundary and revoked the privilege after repeated incidents, which led to the boyfriend getting upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the basic fairness here. The author owns the car and is responsible for all expenses, including maintenance, insurance, and gas. The boyfriend, despite living together, isn't contributing financially, which the author finds unfair. The boyfriend uses the car for his visits, which are significant (3.5 hours away), and each time he takes it with a full tank and returns it empty. The cost is $60 per tank, and this has happened three times. The author has warned him multiple times, but he keeps forgetting or not offering to refill the gas. \n\nThe boyfriend then plans a weekend trip and is denied access because of the previous behavior. He reacts angrily, calling the author names like juvenile and vindictive. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the author is maintaining their own property and setting boundaries. The boyfriend is using someone else's resources without contributing, which is not a shared expense in a relationship. Even in relationships where couples share expenses, if the car is owned by one person, the other shouldn't expect unlimited use without compensation. The author's decision to revoke the privilege after repeated warnings seems reasonable because the boyfriend isn't respecting the agreed-upon terms. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is also problematic because he's blaming the author instead of taking responsibility for his own actions. He's not acknowledging that he hasn't been paying for the gas or maintaining the car's fuel level. The author is protecting their own financial interests and personal property, which is a valid right. \n\nIn terms of relationships, communication is key. The author tried to communicate the issue multiple times, and when that didn't work, they took action. The boyfriend's response indicates a lack of consideration for the author's feelings and financial situation. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They're standing up for their own property and financial responsibilities. The boyfriend is not respecting those boundaries and is not contributing as he should. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
