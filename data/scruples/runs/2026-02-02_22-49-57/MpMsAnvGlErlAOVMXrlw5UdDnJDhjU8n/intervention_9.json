I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a boyfriend not paying for gas when he borrows the car to visit his grandma and other things, leading the author to cut off his access to the car. The boyfriend is upset and accuses the author of being vindictive.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The boyfriend has borrowed the car multiple times and left it with an empty tank, costing the author $60 each time. The author has warned him several times, and he keeps forgetting or not offering to pay. The author then decides to stop letting him borrow the car, leading to an argument where the boyfriend calls her names.\n\nThe key points here are about fairness and responsibility. The car is the author's, and she's paying for maintenance, insurance, and gas. The boyfriend isn't contributing financially, which could be seen as unfair. When he borrows the car, he uses the gas but doesn't pay for it, which is a cost the author has to bear. The author has given clear warnings, and the boyfriend hasn't corrected his behavior. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction\u2014calling her names and accusing her of holding grudges\u2014suggests he's dismissing her legitimate concerns. The author's response is to take away his access to the car, which is her right as the owner. She's trying to enforce accountability. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the boyfriend is using a resource (the car) that he isn't helping to maintain financially. The author is within her rights to set boundaries. The boyfriend's frustration might stem from not seeing the financial burden he's causing. However, the author's actions are a direct response to his repeated failures to meet her conditions. \n\nI don't see any evidence that the author is being unreasonable. She's communicated her expectations, and the boyfriend hasn't complied. Cutting off access is a logical consequence. The boyfriend's anger and accusations seem misplaced here. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
