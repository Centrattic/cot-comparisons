I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend who uses the author's car without contributing to gas or maintenance, despite being warned. The author finally decides to stop allowing him to borrow the car, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend uses the car multiple times, each time leaving it empty. The cost adds up, and the author has clearly asked him to stop if he doesn't change his behavior. The boyfriend doesn't take responsibility and even accuses the author of being vindictive.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) The car is the author's, and she's paying for it. 2) The boyfriend isn't contributing financially. 3) The author set a boundary after warnings, which the boyfriend ignored. 4) The boyfriend's reaction is defensive and dismissive of her concerns.\n\nLegally, the boyfriend has no claim to the car. Since it's her property, she can decide who uses it and under what conditions. The boyfriend's refusal to pay for gas is a matter of fairness, not legality. The author's decision to revoke the privilege is a reasonable response to a repeated violation of agreed terms. The boyfriend's anger and accusations seem misplaced, as he's the one not meeting the expectations. \n\nThe author isn't being unreasonable; she's standing up for her own financial interests and boundaries. The boyfriend's behavior shows a lack of respect for her property and her needs. Therefore, the author is in the right, and the answer should be B.\n"
