I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a boyfriend who uses the author's car to visit his grandmother, often returning it empty without refueling, and not contributing to costs. The author decided to stop letting him borrow the car after repeated issues, which led to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The author's perspective: they own the car, pay for maintenance, insurance, and gas. The boyfriend uses the car multiple times, depleting the gas each time without refilling or paying. The author has warned him multiple times, and after he ignores the warnings, she stops allowing him to use the car. She argues it's unfair to bear these costs alone.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction: he's upset, calls her names like juvenile and vindictive. He might feel that the author is overreacting or holding a grudge. However, he hasn't taken responsibility for his actions, just says he'll remember next time but doesn't. He might not see the financial burden as a big deal, but the author is clearly affected by the costs.\n\nLegally and ethically, when someone borrows a car, they're usually expected to cover the gas costs, especially if they use it for their own purposes. The boyfriend isn't contributing financially, which is a key point. The author is within her rights to set boundaries, especially after warnings and repeated offenses. The boyfriend's frustration might stem from not understanding the financial impact or feeling it's not a significant issue compared to the relationship.\n\nThe boyfriend's behavior shows a lack of responsibility and respect for the author's property and finances. The author's decision to stop lending the car is a reasonable response to protect her own resources. The boyfriend's reaction (calling her names) indicates immaturity in handling the situation, which supports the author's stance.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author isn't unreasonable in expecting her partner to contribute when using her vehicle. The boyfriend's refusal to pay and the repeated neglect of refilling the gas are the main issues. The author's actions are a justified consequence after multiple warnings. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
