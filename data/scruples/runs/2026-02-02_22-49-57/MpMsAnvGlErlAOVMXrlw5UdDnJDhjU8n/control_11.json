I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author's boyfriend keeps borrowing her car to visit his grandma and other things, but each time he takes it with a full tank and returns it empty. The author is upset because she's the one paying for the car, maintenance, insurance, and the gas. She's told him multiple times that if this keeps happening, she won't let him borrow the car anymore. When she finally takes away the car, he gets angry and accuses her of being vindictive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ownership aspect. The car is hers, and she's the one paying for everything. The boyfriend doesn't contribute anything. So when he borrows the car, he's essentially using her resources. If he takes it and uses up the gas, that's her money going out. Even if he says he'll remember to refill it next time, he hasn't done so in the past. This is a pattern of behavior where he's not responsible with her property. \n\nShe's given him warnings and set a boundary. He's not respecting those boundaries, which is leading her to take away the car. His reaction is to call her names like juvenile and vindictive, which suggests he feels she's overreacting. But from her perspective, she's standing up for her own property and her own financial limits. \n\nIs there any other angle? Maybe he feels entitled to use the car because they live together? But the car is hers, and he hasn't contributed to it. Even if they live together, that doesn't mean shared expenses unless they've agreed otherwise. So she's within her rights to set rules about borrowing the car. \n\nHe's not taking responsibility for the gas, even though he uses it. That's a key point. If he uses her gas, he should compensate her, either by refilling the tank or contributing the cost. Since he's not doing that, she's justified in her stance. \n\nSo the author isn't in the wrong. She's protecting her property and her finances after repeated issues. The boyfriend is not respecting her boundaries and is being irresponsible. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
