I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about the boyfriend borrowing the car for visits to his grandma, but not refilling the gas each time. The author has a car that they pay for, and the boyfriend refuses to contribute to costs since it's not \"his\" car. The boyfriend keeps borrowing it, using all the gas, and the author is upset they're covering the costs. Now, the boyfriend wants to take the car again for a trip, and the author refuses, leading to an argument where he accuses her of being juvenile. The user thinks the author is right but wants confirmation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the fairness of the situation. The car is the author's, so she's responsible for all expenses. The boyfriend is using it without contributing, which seems unfair. He's been warned multiple times but didn't change his behavior. The author is within her rights to set boundaries, especially since he's not respecting her rules. The boyfriend's reaction of calling her vindictive and holding grudges might be his way of deflecting from his own actions. \n\nBut maybe there's another angle. The boyfriend's visits to his grandma could be important to him, so the author's refusal might be causing him hardship. However, the problem is that he's not respecting the agreed terms (bringing back a full tank). If the author had agreed to let him use the car with a full tank each time, and he repeatedly fails to do that, her withdrawing the privilege is reasonable. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend not offering to pay for gas despite using the car for trips is another point. The author is maintaining the car, including gas, insurance, etc., so expecting the boyfriend to contribute makes sense, but he refuses. That adds to the tension.\n\nThe key factors here are: ownership of the car, the terms of borrowing (full tank), and the boyfriend's repeated violations. The author's response is a consequence of his actions. The boyfriend's anger might stem from feeling deprived of something he considers a right, but since it's her car, she's not obligated to let him use it under those conditions. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. She's enforcing her rules and taking responsibility for her car. The boyfriend's behavior is the issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
