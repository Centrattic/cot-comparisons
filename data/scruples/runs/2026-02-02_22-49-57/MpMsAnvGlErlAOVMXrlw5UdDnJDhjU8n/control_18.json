I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a couple living together. The boyfriend uses the author's car to visit his grandma, which is a 3.5-hour drive. Each time he takes the car, he starts with a full tank and returns it empty, costing the author $60 each time. This has happened three times, and the author is upset because the boyfriend refuses to pay for the car's maintenance, insurance, or the gas. The boyfriend brushes it off, apologizes but doesn't change his behavior. The author then decides to stop letting him borrow the car, which makes the boyfriend angry, calling her juvenile and vindictive.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the responsibilities here. The car is the author's, and she's the one paying for everything. The boyfriend uses it but doesn't contribute financially. Even though the car isn't his, he's benefiting from it. The main issue is the repeated use without reimbursement for the gas. Each trip costs $60, which adds up. The boyfriend's refusal to pay and the author's attempts to address it without success lead her to stop allowing the car use. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the boyfriend is using a resource that the author owns and pays for, without contributing. The author set a boundary after multiple warnings, which seems reasonable. The boyfriend's reaction is defensive and dismissive, which might indicate he's not taking her concerns seriously. \n\nPossible angles to consider: Is it the author's right to set boundaries? Yes, since it's her car. Is the boyfriend in the wrong for not paying? Yes, as he's using the car and the associated costs. The author's response (withholding the car) is a logical consequence. The boyfriend's anger and accusations might be unfounded, as he's aware of the rules but still didn't comply. \n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
