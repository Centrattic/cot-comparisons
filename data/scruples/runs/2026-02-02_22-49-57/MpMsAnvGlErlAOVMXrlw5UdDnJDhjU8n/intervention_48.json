I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not letting her boyfriend visit his grandma because he doesn't refill the gas after borrowing her car. \n\nFirst, the boyfriend has borrowed the car multiple times, each time taking it with a full tank and returning it empty. The cost adds up\u2014$60 per tank, three times. The author has warned him multiple times that if this continues, she'll stop letting him use the car. Now he's upset when she follows through.\n\nSo, the key points here are: ownership of the car, responsibility for gas, and communication. The car is hers, so she's maintaining and insuring it. He's not contributing financially, which is a point of contention. He's supposed to return the car with a full tank but doesn't. Despite warnings, he doesn't change his behavior. When she enforces her rule, he gets angry, calling her names and accusing her of holding grudges.\n\nThe question hinges on fairness and respect. The author is trying to enforce boundaries she's communicated. The boyfriend isn't respecting those boundaries and is not taking responsibility for the agreed-upon terms of borrowing the car. His reaction seems dismissive and accusatory, which isn't helping the situation. \n\nFrom an objective standpoint, the author isn't wrong in setting boundaries, especially since she's the one bearing the costs. The boyfriend's actions are inconsiderate, and his response is inappropriate. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for taking away the privilege.\n"
