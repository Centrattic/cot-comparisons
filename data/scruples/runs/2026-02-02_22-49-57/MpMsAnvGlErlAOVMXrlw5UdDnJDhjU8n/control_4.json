I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a boyfriend borrowing the author's car and not refilling the gas each time. The author has a small car she pays for, and he keeps taking it to see his grandma, using up gas without replenishing it. She's tried warning him multiple times, but he just says sorry and forgets. Now, when he asked to borrow the car again, she said no, and he got angry, calling her names.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The boyfriend is using the car he doesn't own, and he's not contributing to the costs. The author is covering all maintenance, insurance, and gas. Each trip to the grandma uses up a full tank, costing $60 each time. That adds up, especially over three times. The boyfriend's attitude seems dismissive; he acknowledges the problem but doesn't take responsibility. The author tried giving warnings, which is reasonable, but he didn't change his behavior. So when she decided to stop allowing him to borrow the car, he reacted negatively.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, she's within her rights to set boundaries, especially since he's using her resources without contributing. She's communicated her limits clearly. The boyfriend's actions are inconsiderate and disrespectful, expecting to use the car without accountability. The author isn't being vindictive; she's standing up for her own financial well-being. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
