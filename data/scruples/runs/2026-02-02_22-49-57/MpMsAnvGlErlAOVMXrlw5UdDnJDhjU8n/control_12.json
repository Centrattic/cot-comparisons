I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a boyfriend who's been borrowing the author's car to visit his grandmother, but he never puts gas back in, and the author is upset about the costs. The boyfriend is getting angry when the author stops allowing the car to be borrowed.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The couple has been living together for three years. The boyfriend sold his car when he went back to university two years ago. The author has a car that they pay for maintenance and insurance, and the boyfriend refuses to contribute since it's not his. He borrows the car multiple times, each trip being 3.5 hours away, which uses a full tank. He takes it with a full tank and returns it empty, costing $60 each time. This has happened three times, and he just says sorry and forgets again. The author has warned him that if he keeps doing this, she won't let him borrow the car. When he wants to take it again, she revokes the privilege, and he gets angry, calling her names.\n\nSo, the question is, is the author in the wrong for not letting him borrow the car anymore?\n\nFrom my understanding, the boyfriend is using the car but not contributing to the costs. The car is the author's, and she's paying for maintenance, insurance, and gas. The boyfriend isn't helping with any of that, and when he uses the car, he's depleting the gas without replacing it. This seems like a fair point from the author's side. She's trying to set boundaries when he's not respecting the agreement. His response is to accuse her of being juvenile and holding grudges, but he's actually the one not following through on his responsibilities.\n\nThe boyfriend's behavior is inconsiderate. He's using a resource (the car) that he's not contributing to, and when confronted, he doesn't take responsibility. The author is standing up for herself by revoking the privilege, which is a reasonable response. The boyfriend's anger and accusations are unwarranted because he's the one who hasn't respected her boundaries.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author is not in the wrong. She's making a stand after repeated requests to address the issue. The boyfriend's actions are the problem here, not hers. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
