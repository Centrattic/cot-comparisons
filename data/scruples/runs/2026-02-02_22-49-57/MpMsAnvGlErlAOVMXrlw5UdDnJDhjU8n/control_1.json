I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the post) is in the wrong for not allowing her boyfriend to borrow her car anymore. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple has been together for three years and live together. The boyfriend sold his car to go back to university. The author has a small car that she pays for, including maintenance, insurance, and gas. The boyfriend uses her car to visit his grandmother, who lives 3.5 hours away. Each time he takes the car, he borrows it with a full tank and returns it empty, costing the author $60 each time. He's done this three times and hasn't paid anything towards the car's expenses. When the author warns him that she won't let him borrow the car anymore if this continues, he gets upset and accuses her of being unfair.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the author is justified in her decision to not let him borrow the car. Let's break it down. The boyfriend is using a car that isn't his, and he's not contributing to the costs. The author is clearly upset about the financial burden this places on her. She's tried multiple times to communicate her concerns, but he hasn't changed his behavior. Now, she's decided to revoke his access to the car, which leads to conflict.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the boyfriend is using a resource (the car) that the author is solely responsible for. Even if they live together, the car is hers, and he's not contributing financially. It's reasonable for her to expect that if he uses her car, he should cover the associated costs, like gas. The fact that he keeps asking and not paying could be seen as taking advantage.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction seems overly defensive. He accuses her of holding grudges when she's clearly communicated her concerns. His refusal to pay or refill the gas is disrespectful to her efforts to maintain the car. The author's decision to stop lending the car is a reasonable consequence for his repeated negligence.\n\nHowever, one might argue that the boyfriend is trying to visit family, which is important. But that doesn't absolve him from the responsibility of covering the costs. If he truly wants to visit his grandmother, he should find a way to contribute to the expenses, perhaps by paying for the gas or other costs himself.\n\nIn relationships, communication and mutual respect are key. The author has tried to communicate her boundaries, and the boyfriend's response is dismissive and accusatory. This suggests a lack of respect for her feelings and the financial aspect she's highlighting. The author isn't being vindictive; she's setting a boundary to protect her own resources after repeated issues.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. She has a valid reason for her decision, and the boyfriend's behavior has been inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
