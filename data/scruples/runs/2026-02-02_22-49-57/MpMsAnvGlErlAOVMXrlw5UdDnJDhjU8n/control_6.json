I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not letting her boyfriend visit his grandma after he consistently didn't refill her gas.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend lives with her and uses her car, which he's not contributing to. He's been borrowing the car multiple times, each time taking it with a full tank and returning it empty. Each trip costs her $60 in gas, and this has happened three times. She's told him she's upset about it, but he just apologizes and forgets again. Now he wants to take the car for a weekend trip, and she refuses because of his past behavior. He gets angry, saying she's being vindictive.\n\nHmm. So, from my perspective, the boyfriend is not being responsible. He's using the car without contributing to its costs. Even though it's her car, when you're in a relationship and someone uses your resources, it's reasonable to expect some contribution. She's clear about her boundaries. He's not respecting those boundaries by not paying for the gas. She's had multiple chances to remind him, and he's ignored them. Now she's cutting off the privilege because he hasn't respected her wishes. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is a bit harsh. He seems to be dismissing her feelings and accusing her of being juvenile. But she's standing up for her own financial well-being. It's her car, so she's within her rights to set the rules for its use. He needs to take responsibility for his actions. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong here. She's trying to address a repeated issue that's costing her money. The boyfriend is at fault for not respecting her and the agreed-upon terms. So the answer should be B.\n"
