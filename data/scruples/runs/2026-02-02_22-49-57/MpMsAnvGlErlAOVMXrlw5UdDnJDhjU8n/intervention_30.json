I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong for not letting her boyfriend visit his grandma because he keeps borrowing her car without refueling or contributing to costs.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend uses the car multiple times to visit his grandma, which is 3.5 hours away. Each time, he takes it with a full tank and returns it empty. The tank refill costs $60 each time, and this has happened three times. The author has tried to warn him, but he doesn't follow through. Now, when he wants to take another trip, the author refuses because of his past behavior. He reacts angrily, calling her names like juvenile and vindictive.\n\nSo, the key points here are: ownership of the car, financial responsibility, and communication. The car is the author's, and she's paying for insurance, maintenance, and gas. The boyfriend is using it without contributing. Even though they live together and maybe see the car as shared, legally it's hers. He's using it without compensation, which is a problem. The author has given warnings, and after repeated infractions, she decides to stop allowing him to borrow the car. His reaction seems excessive, accusing her of holding grudges.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a fairness perspective, if someone uses a resource they don't own and aren't paying for, it's reasonable to set boundaries. The boyfriend isn't respecting her property or her financial input. The author is trying to protect her own interests, which is valid. His anger seems misplaced because he's the one not following agreed terms. \n\nPossible counterarguments: maybe the boyfriend feels the car is shared because they live together. But the author made it clear that it's her car and she expects it returned full. He agreed before, then didn't follow through. So the author isn't wrong in taking the car away after repeated violations. His reaction is more about defensiveness than a valid grievance. \n\nIn terms of relationships, this is a conflict about boundaries and respect. The author is asserting her right to her property, which is a reasonable action. The boyfriend's behavior is inconsiderate, so the author isn't at fault here. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
