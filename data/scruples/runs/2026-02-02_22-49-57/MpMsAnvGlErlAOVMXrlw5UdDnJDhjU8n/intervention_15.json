I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this story is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple who live together, and the boyfriend keeps borrowing the girl's car to visit his grandma, which is a 3.5-hour drive. Each time, he takes it with a full tank and returns it empty, costing the girl $60 each time. She's told him multiple times that if he continues, she'll stop letting him borrow the car. When he asks again, she says no, and he gets angry, calling her juvenile and vindictive.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The main issue is the boyfriend using the car and not refueling it, leading to financial burden on the girl. He refuses to pay for maintenance, insurance, or gas. She's given warnings, but he ignores them. When she finally takes away the privilege, he reacts negatively.\n\nFrom the girl's perspective, she's paying for a car that's not hers, and the boyfriend isn't contributing. The boyfriend's actions are causing recurring expenses. She's trying to set boundaries, which seems reasonable. His response of anger and accusations might indicate a lack of respect for her limits.\n\nThe boyfriend's behavior seems inconsiderate. He's using her resources without contributing financially, despite her explicit warnings. His refusal to take responsibility and the hostile reaction suggest he's at fault. The girl's decision to stop letting him borrow the car is a logical step after repeated issues.\n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and consideration are important. The boyfriend isn't respecting her ownership and the financial responsibilities she's taking on. The girl is protecting her own interests and setting boundaries, which is justified. The boyfriend's accusations of her being vindictive are unfounded here because he's the one not adhering to the agreed-upon terms.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
