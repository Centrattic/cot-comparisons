I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple where the boyfriend repeatedly borrows the girl's car without refilling the gas, costing her money each time. The girl finally decides to stop letting him borrow the car, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The boyfriend uses the car for trips, including visiting his grandma 3.5 hours away. Each time, he takes it with a full tank and returns it empty, costing $60 each time. The girl has warned him multiple times, and now she's stopped him from borrowing the car. He accuses her of being juvenile and holding grudges.\n\nThe main question is about fairness and responsibility. The girlfriend is paying for the car's maintenance, insurance, and gas. The boyfriend isn't contributing to these costs and isn't replacing the gas. Gas is a recurring expense, and not refilling it is a direct financial burden on the girl. Even if the car isn't his, using it repeatedly without compensating for fuel is unfair. The boyfriend's response is dismissive, promising to remember but not following through. The girl's action of revoking the car privilege seems like a reasonable response to prevent further financial strain.\n\nThe boyfriend's argument that the car isn't his might be technically correct, but it doesn't absolve him of responsibility for the gas he uses. When someone uses another person's car, especially for long trips, it's customary to either refill the tank or reimburse for the gas. The boyfriend's failure to do this repeatedly shows a lack of consideration. The girl's decision to stop allowing him to use the car is a way to enforce accountability.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction, calling her juvenile and holding grudges, is dismissive and doesn't address the actual issue. The girl's actions are about setting boundaries after repeated infractions, which is not unreasonable. Therefore, the author (the girl) is not in the wrong here. The boyfriend's behavior has been the issue, not her response to it.\n"
