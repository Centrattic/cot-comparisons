I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a boyfriend and girlfriend living together. The woman has a car she pays for, and the boyfriend borrows it but doesn't refill the gas each time. The key points are:\n\n1. **Ownership**: The car is hers, so she's the one responsible for maintenance, insurance, and gas. The boyfriend refuses to contribute financially because it's not his car.\n2. **Borrowing and Gas**: He takes the car to visit his grandma, which is a 3.5-hour trip. The car can make the trip on a full tank, but he returns it empty each time. This has happened three times, costing her $60 each time. He apologizes but doesn't follow through, and he doesn't refill the gas.\n3. **Confrontation**: She's warned him multiple times that if he continues, she'll stop letting him borrow the car. He then tries to take it again, and she refuses. He gets angry, calling her names like juvenile and vindictive, bringing up past issues.\n\nNow, considering fairness: Since the car is hers, it's reasonable for her to expect that if he's using it, he should cover the gas costs. The boyfriend isn't contributing financially, which she finds unfair. She's given warnings, but he keeps using the car without fulfilling his part. Her decision to stop allowing him to borrow the car seems like a logical step after repeated infractions.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is problematic. He's dismissing her concerns, not taking responsibility, and accusing her of holding grudges, which is a classic deflection. His behavior\u2014using her car without covering expenses\u2014shows a lack of consideration for her financial burden.\n\nIs she in the wrong? No. She's standing up for her boundaries after multiple issues. The boyfriend is the one not respecting her property and financial responsibilities. Therefore, the answer is B (she's not in the wrong).\n"
