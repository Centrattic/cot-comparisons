I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend not contributing to car expenses when he borrows it, and the author is refusing to let him borrow it anymore because of that.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The couple has been together for three years and lives together. The boyfriend sold his car when he went back to university two years ago, so now he relies on the author's car. The author pays for maintenance, insurance, and gas, and the boyfriend refuses to contribute because it's not his car. He's borrowed the car three times to visit his grandmother, which is a 3.5-hour trip, and each time he takes it with a full tank and returns it empty. The cost is $60 per tank, and he never offers to pay for the gas, only apologizes for forgetting next time. The author has warned him multiple times, and now he wants to take the car again, but she's saying no. He got angry, calling her juvenile and vindictive.\n\nSo, the main issue here is fairness and responsibility in sharing a car. The boyfriend is using the car for long trips, which consume a lot of gas, but he's not contributing to the cost. The author is taking it seriously and setting a boundary by revoking his access. The boyfriend's reaction is dismissive, saying it's not his car, and then gets upset when the boundary is enforced.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, if they live together and share a car, splitting the costs like insurance, maintenance, and gas makes sense. The boyfriend isn't contributing, even though he's using the car extensively. The author is covering all expenses, which is a significant financial burden. The boyfriend's attitude of \"it's not my car\" seems to be avoiding responsibility. He's been given multiple chances to fix the issue but hasn't, which shows a pattern of behavior, not a one-time mistake.\n\nThe author's response is to stop allowing him to borrow the car. That's a logical consequence if he's not respecting her boundaries. The boyfriend reacting angrily and blaming her instead of acknowledging the problem or offering a solution suggests that he might not see the issue from her perspective. In such cases, it's about whether using the car without contributing to shared expenses is reasonable. Since they live together, it's implied that they are sharing some responsibilities, and the boyfriend's refusal to pay for gas he's using seems unfair. The author has the right to set boundaries, and revoking the car access is a valid step if he's not willing to respect her terms. The boyfriend's frustration is misplaced because the author is standing up for her own financial responsibility.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't the one at fault. The boyfriend is not contributing to the shared expenses despite frequent use, which is the core issue. The author's actions are justified as she's protecting her own interests after repeated failures to address the problem. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
