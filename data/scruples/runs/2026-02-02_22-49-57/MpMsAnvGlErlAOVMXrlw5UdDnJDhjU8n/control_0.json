I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple where the boyfriend keeps borrowing the girlfriend's car to visit his grandma, but doesn't pay for the gas and leaves it empty each time. The girlfriend finally says no, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, the car is the girlfriend's. She's the one paying for maintenance, insurance, and gas. The boyfriend refuses to contribute because it's not his car. But he uses it multiple times, costing her $60 each trip. She's given warnings, but he keeps doing it. Now she's taken away his access, and he's upset, calling her juvenile and vindictive.\n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Well, she owns the car and is bearing all the costs. The boyfriend is using her resources without contributing. It's not fair for him not to pay for the gas he uses. She's given him chances to correct his behavior, but he hasn't. Taking away the car is her right as the owner. His reaction seems to be blaming her instead of taking responsibility. \n\nThe key points here are ownership and responsibility. Since the car is hers, she has every right to set the terms of its use. His refusal to cover the gas costs and repeated negligence in refueling are issues on his part. Her decision to stop lending the car is a reasonable response to his lack of cooperation and respect for her property. Therefore, she's not in the wrong.\n"
