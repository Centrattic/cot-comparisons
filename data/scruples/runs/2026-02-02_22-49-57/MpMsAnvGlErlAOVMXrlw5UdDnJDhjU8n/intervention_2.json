I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in not allowing her boyfriend to borrow her car anymore. The boyfriend has a history of borrowing the car, using all the gas, and not reimbursing her. The author has given warnings, but he still doesn't change his behavior. Now, he's upset when she revokes his privilege.\n\nFirst, the key points: The car is hers, she's the one paying for maintenance and insurance. He uses it without contributing. Each time he takes it, he uses a full tank and returns it empty, costing her $60 each time. She's tried to warn him, but he ignores it. Then he wants to take it again, and she says no. He gets angry, calling her names.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if you're using someone's car and it's costing them money, it's reasonable to expect some contribution. The boyfriend isn't compensating her for the gas, which is a direct expense. The author is protecting her own financial interests by setting boundaries after multiple warnings. Revoking the privilege is a logical consequence when the terms aren't respected. His reaction is about how he feels about her actions, but the author isn't obligated to let him use her car. The boyfriend's argument seems to be about his feelings rather than the actual issue of her ownership and expenses. So, the author is justified in her stance. Answer B.\n"
