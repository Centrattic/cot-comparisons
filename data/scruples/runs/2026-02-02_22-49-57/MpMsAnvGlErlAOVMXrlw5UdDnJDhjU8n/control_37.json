I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about the boyfriend borrowing the girlfriend's car multiple times, each time taking it with a full tank and returning it empty. The girlfriend is upset because she has to pay for the gas, which costs her $60 each time, and the boyfriend isn't contributing. He's supposed to be in a university and they live together, but he's not paying for the car's maintenance or insurance since it's not his car. The woman has given several warnings, and now she's decided to stop letting him borrow the car after he didn't respect the previous warnings. He got angry and accused her of being vindictive.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if her actions are justified. The boyfriend is using her car, which she owns, and he's not paying for the gas he uses. Since they live together, is there an expectation that they should share costs? But he's not contributing anything towards the car's expenses, which includes insurance and maintenance. That seems unfair because she's shouldering all the costs. \n\nWhen he borrows the car, he's using her resources without contributing to them. Even if the car isn't in his name, if they're in a shared living situation, maybe there's an unspoken agreement to split costs. But he refuses to pay, which is a problem. The girlfriend is within her rights to set boundaries, especially since he's not following through on his promises to return the car with a full tank. \n\nHe's taken the car multiple times, each time leaving it empty, and despite warnings, he continues. This shows a pattern of behavior where he's not respecting her property and the agreed-upon terms. The girlfriend then takes away his privilege to use the car, which is a logical consequence. His reaction of calling her names and accusing her of holding grudges might be because he's defensive about his behavior, not necessarily because she's wrong.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? She's protecting her own property and the financial burden, which is reasonable. The boyfriend's actions are the ones that are disrespectful and neglectful. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong; she's standing up for her rights as the car owner.\n"
