I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's boyfriend keeps borrowing her car to visit his grandma, 3.5 hours away. Each time, he takes it with a full tank and returns it empty, costing her $60 each time. He refuses to pay for the car's maintenance and insurance, and even after warnings, he doesn't put gas back or offer to pay. The author then stops allowing him to borrow the car, leading to an argument where he accuses her of being juvenile.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the fairness of the situation. The car is the author's, so she's responsible for costs. The boyfriend isn't contributing to the car's expenses but benefits from using it. This seems unfair. He's using her car for his personal trips, which are significant in distance and frequency. The fact that he doesn't replenish the gas or pay for maintenance adds to the unfairness. The author has given multiple warnings, but he didn't change his behavior. So when she decides to stop allowing him to borrow the car, is that justified?\n\nFrom a practical standpoint, the boyfriend is using a shared resource (the car) without contributing. Even though they live together, the car isn't his, so he's not obligated to pay for it. However, since he's using it, it's reasonable to expect some shared responsibility, like contributing to gas or maintenance. But he refuses to do that, which is a problem. The author's decision to restrict access because of his repeated failures to meet her conditions seems reasonable. She's protecting her own property and expenses.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is also a point to consider. He's losing his temper and calling her names, which isn't helpful. The author's boundaries are being respected, and his reaction might indicate a lack of consideration for her feelings and the financial burden. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? I think not. She's asserting her right to manage her own property and expenses. The boyfriend's behavior is the issue here. He's not respecting her rules and is not contributing where he should. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
