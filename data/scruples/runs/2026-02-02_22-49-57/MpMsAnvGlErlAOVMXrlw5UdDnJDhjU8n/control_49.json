I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario involves a boyfriend who borrows the author's car multiple times, using up all the gas each time and not paying for the maintenance or insurance. The author has given warnings but the boyfriend keeps doing it, leading the author to deny him use of the car. The boyfriend then accuses her of being juvenile.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The boyfriend is using the car he doesn't own, which the author is paying for. He's using it for trips that are 3.5 hours away, which he can do since the car's tank holds enough for a round trip. However, he's not refueling it after each use. The author has asked him to stop if he doesn't change his behavior, and he's upset about it.\n\nThe main issue here is sharing a resource (the car) without contributing to its costs. The boyfriend is not paying for gas or maintenance, which is the author's responsibility. Even though he's using it for family visits, which might be important, that doesn't absolve him of the responsibility to cover the associated costs. The author is within her rights to set boundaries, especially since she's the one financially burdened.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction is also problematic. He's called her names and accused her of holding grudges, which is a deflection from his own actions. The author has tried to warn him multiple times, giving him chances to correct his behavior, but he hasn't. Therefore, her decision to revoke his car access is a reasonable step to protect her own interests.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the boyfriend is not contributing to the expenses for using the car. The author is not at fault for wanting to stop this arrangement when it's not respected. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
