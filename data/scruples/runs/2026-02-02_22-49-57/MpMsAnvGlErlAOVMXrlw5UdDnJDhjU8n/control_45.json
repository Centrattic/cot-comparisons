I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. So the boyfriend is borrowing the car to visit his grandma, but each time he takes the car with a full tank and returns it empty, costing the author $60 each time. He's done this three times and other times as well. The author has warned him multiple times that if it continues, she won't let him borrow the car anymore. When he asked again, she said no, and he got angry, calling her names like juvenile and vindictive.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's actions are justified. The boyfriend is using her car without contributing to the costs. Even though he doesn't own the car, he's using it, so it's reasonable to expect him to share the expenses. The fact that he's been warned and still hasn't changed his behavior suggests he's not taking her concerns seriously. The author is trying to hold him accountable, which seems fair. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction of anger and name-calling is a red flag. He's dismissing her feelings and not taking responsibility. The author is standing up for herself, which is necessary when someone isn't respecting boundaries. The boyfriend's argument that it's not his car doesn't hold weight because he's benefiting from its use. The author is within her rights to set boundaries, especially after multiple failed warnings. \n\nI should also consider if there's any nuance I'm missing. Maybe the boyfriend has a valid reason for not paying, but the problem is his refusal to acknowledge the cost he's causing. The author isn't being vindictive; she's enforcing a rule to protect her own resources. So, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
