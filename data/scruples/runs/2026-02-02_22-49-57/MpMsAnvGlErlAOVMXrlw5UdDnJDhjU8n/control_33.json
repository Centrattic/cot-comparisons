I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit post is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend who keeps borrowing the girlfriend's car to visit his grandma, but never refills the gas, which costs her money. The girlfriend has warned him multiple times but he keeps doing it, and now she's taken away his access to the car. He got angry and accused her of being vindictive.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both sides. The girlfriend has a car that she pays for, including maintenance and insurance. Her boyfriend uses it without contributing to the costs. Even though he's her partner, using the car without paying for the gas seems unfair. She's being responsible by maintaining the car, but he's not contributing. The boyfriend, on the other hand, might feel that visiting his grandma is important and that he should be allowed to use the car, maybe thinking he's just borrowing it and will return it. However, he's not following through on the agreed-upon responsibility of keeping the gas full.\n\nThe girlfriend set boundaries after multiple warnings, which he ignored. When she took away the car, he reacted negatively. This shows he wasn't respecting her boundaries. In a relationship, both parties should respect each other's property and agreements. Since he's living with her and using her car, contributing to the costs is reasonable. The girlfriend is within her rights to set these boundaries because it's her car and her expenses. The boyfriend's behavior is inconsiderate and not respecting her financial contributions. Therefore, the author (girlfriend) isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
