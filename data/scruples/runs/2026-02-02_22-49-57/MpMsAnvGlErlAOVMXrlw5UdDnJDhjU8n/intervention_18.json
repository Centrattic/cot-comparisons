I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple living together where the boyfriend borrows the girlfriend's car, uses up the gas, and doesn't replenish it or contribute to the costs. The girlfriend has warned him multiple times, and now she's refusing to let him borrow the car anymore, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the fairness of the girlfriend's actions. The boyfriend is using her car, which she owns and maintains, including paying for gas. Each time he takes it, he uses up the gas but doesn't refill it, even after multiple warnings. She's given him clear boundaries, and when he continues the behavior, she revokes his access to the car. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if someone is using another person's resources without contributing, it's reasonable to set boundaries. The boyfriend's actions are inconsiderate since he's not covering the costs he incurs. The girlfriend is within her rights as the car owner to set conditions for its use. The boyfriend's reaction\u2014calling her juvenile and vindictive\u2014seems defensive and dismissive of her legitimate concerns. \n\nThe girlfriend's decision to stop allowing him to borrow the car is a logical consequence after repeated infractions. She's trying to protect her own financial interests and set clear expectations. The boyfriend's behavior\u2014ignoring warnings and not taking responsibility\u2014makes the girlfriend's stance justified. \n\nPossible counterarguments might suggest that he's in a relationship and should have a mutual understanding. However, the boyfriend isn't contributing to the shared expenses, which is a key point. The girlfriend isn't being unreasonable by enforcing her rules after multiple warnings. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
