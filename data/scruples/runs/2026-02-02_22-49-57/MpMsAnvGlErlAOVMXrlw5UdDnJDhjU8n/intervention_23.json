I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a boyfriend who borrows the author's car without contributing to the costs and then gets upset when the author stops him.\n\nFirst, the boyfriend lives with the author and uses her car multiple times. Each time, he takes it with a full tank and returns it empty, costing around $60 each time. This has happened three times, and he never offers to pay for the gas or refill the tank. The author has warned him several times, and when he continues, she decides to stop letting him borrow the car. He reacts poorly, calling her names like juvenile and vindictive.\n\nThe key points here are about fairness and responsibility. The car is the author's, so she's responsible for all maintenance, insurance, and fuel costs. The boyfriend isn't contributing, even though he benefits from using the car. The author is setting a boundary after repeated infractions. The boyfriend's reaction seems disproportionate, especially since he was warned each time. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, it's reasonable for the author to expect that if someone uses her resources, they should contribute to the costs. The boyfriend's refusal to do so and his dismissive attitude about the cost (\"it's not his car\") shows a lack of consideration. The author is protecting her own financial interests and the value of the car, which she's paying for.\n\nThe boyfriend's anger and the accusations he makes (like holding onto old grudges) don't seem justified given the repeated issues. The author is enforcing a necessary boundary after multiple warnings, which is a responsible action. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
