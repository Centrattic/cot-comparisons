I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a boyfriend who borrows his partner's car multiple times, uses all the gas, and never pays for it. The partner (author) finally says no when he wants to take the car again, leading to an argument where the boyfriend accuses her of being juvenile.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The boyfriend has borrowed the car several times, each time taking it with a full tank and returning it empty. The cost of gas each time is $60, and this has happened three times. The author has warned him multiple times that if this continues, she won't let him borrow the car anymore. Now, he's asking to take it for a weekend trip, but she refuses. He's upset and called her names.\n\nThe main issue here is financial responsibility and respect for shared resources. The car is hers, and he's using it without contributing to the costs. Even though they live together, the car isn't his, so it's reasonable for her to expect him to cover the gas he uses. The boyfriend's behavior of not refilling the tank or paying for gas is inconsiderate and unfair. He's had prior warnings, so he's aware of the problem but continues the behavior. \n\nWhen the author cuts off access to the car, she's enforcing the boundaries she's already set. The boyfriend's reaction seems disproportionate and dismissive of her legitimate concerns. He's not taking responsibility and is blaming her for being vindictive, which doesn't align with the facts presented. \n\nIn relationships, mutual respect and communication are key. The author has communicated her feelings and consequences clearly. The boyfriend's failure to heed these warnings means he's the one not respecting her boundaries. Therefore, the author is justified in her actions. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
