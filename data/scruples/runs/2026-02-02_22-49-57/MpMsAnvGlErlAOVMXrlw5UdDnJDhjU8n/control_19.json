I have a small car I just finished paying off but that I still pay for the maintenance and insurance on and he refuses to pay anything towards it because \"it's not his car\". \n\nHis grandmother lives 3.5 hours away and he has been to visit her a few times. Each time he borrows the car he takes it with a full tank of gas and brings it back empty (it can make a full trip there on a tank of gas and a tank cost me 60$). This has happened three times now and after each time I have been somewhat irate because I don't feel it's fair for me to pay for the car and the gas for him to drive it. He brushes it off and says hes sorry he forgot  and he'll remember next time but he never does nor does he offer to go fill up the tank. He has also taken it for a few other things and never put gas in it as a thank you). I've given him multiple warnings that if this behaviour continues I won't let him borrow my car anymore... \n\nLast night he informs me that when I'm at work on the weekend he wants to take the car for a day trip to see his grandmother. I tell him he isn't allowed to take my car anymore because he never brings it back full and doesn't pay for it and that through his disrespect he has lost that privledge. He loses his mind. Says I'm being juvenile, vindictive, that I'm holding onto old grudges and bringing up stuff from the past.\n\nSo tell me Reddit AITA? \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. So, the scenario is about a boyfriend not paying for gas when he borrows the car. They live together, and he's been borrowing the car multiple times, each time taking it with a full tank and returning it empty. The author is upset because they have to cover the maintenance, insurance, and gas costs. The boyfriend refuses to pay for the car since it's not his, and even though the author warned him several times, he still doesn't put the gas back or offer to pay. Now, the author has decided to stop letting him borrow the car, and he reacted poorly, calling her names like juvenile and vindictive.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is wrong here. The main points are about fairness and responsibility. The author owns the car and has to pay for everything. When someone borrows a car, especially frequently, it's reasonable to expect that they cover the gas costs. The boyfriend isn't just borrowing for a quick trip; it's a 3.5-hour trip, which is significant. Even if the car is the author's, using it without refueling is a problem because gas is a consumable that the borrower directly uses. \n\nThe boyfriend's argument is that he's sorry and will remember next time, but he never does. This pattern of behavior shows that he's not taking the author's concerns seriously. The author has set boundaries, but he's repeatedly ignored them. The fact that he's upset about the consequence (not being allowed to borrow the car anymore) and accuses her of holding grudges suggests he's not acknowledging his own responsibility. \n\nIn a shared living situation, especially with a partner, splitting expenses can be a point of contention. However, since the car is the author's, it's her property, and she has the right to set terms for its use. The boyfriend's refusal to contribute to the gas cost is a point against him. The author is standing up for her rights and the fair use of her property. \n\nSo, from a fairness standpoint, the author isn't in the wrong. She's being reasonable by asking for the gas to be covered, and when that's not respected, cutting off the privilege is justified. The boyfriend's reaction and refusal to take responsibility are more concerning here. Therefore, the answer should be B, No.\n"
