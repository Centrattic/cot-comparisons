We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a barbershop that mainly serves men, with a female barber available on an appointment basis. They got a customer who is a male-passing woman wanting a men's style haircut. The shop's policy requires appointments for women because they don't have male staff who can cut women's hair due to religious reasons, and they don't train in women's hair. The customer got upset and accused them of being transphobic, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the policy. The shop has clearly stated that they require appointments for women, and they have a female barber for that. The customer might not have known this, but the shop advertised it. So if the customer came in without an appointment, maybe the shop wasn't at fault for not providing the service. However, the customer identified as a male-passing woman, which complicates things. If they present as male, maybe they expected to be treated like any other male customer. But the shop's policy is based on gender, not gender identity. So the question is, does the shop's policy discriminate against transgender or non-binary individuals?\n\nReligious reasons are mentioned as part of the policy. In some places, businesses can claim religious exemptions from anti-discrimination laws, but this can be a gray area. If the shop is refusing service based on gender identity despite the customer presenting as male, that might be seen as discrimination. However, the shop's employees are uncomfortable due to religious beliefs, so maybe they have a right to hold that policy. But the issue is whether requiring an appointment for women when the customer is a transgender man (if that's the case) is appropriate. If the shop's policy is based on the sex assigned at birth rather than gender identity, that could be problematic. Also, the shop's reasoning about hair texture and tools might be a red herring if they can cut men's hair regardless of those factors. They might have a policy that's not actually based on the practical reasons they're giving.\n\nAnother angle is the customer's perspective. If they came in as a male-passing woman, they might not have considered the shop's policy on women. The shop manager tried to explain the appointment system, but the customer didn't listen. However, if the shop's policy is not clear enough, maybe they're at fault for not communicating properly. But the shop did state their policy on their website, etc., so perhaps they did their part.\n\nThe main issue here is whether the shop's policy is discriminatory. If the policy is based on biological sex and not gender identity, then it's possible they're not in the wrong, especially if they have a female barber available. But if the customer is a transgender man, then being required to book an appointment for women's services might be discriminatory. The shop's employees are uncomfortable due to religious beliefs, which might be a valid reason for them, but it's still a point of contention.\n\nI need to check if there are any legal aspects. In many places, businesses cannot refuse service based on gender identity. So if the customer is transgender and the shop refuses service, that could be illegal. However, the shop's employees' religious beliefs might complicate this. There's a balance between religious freedom and anti-discrimination laws. It's possible the shop's policy is in violation if they are required by law to serve all customers regardless of gender identity.\n\nAlso, the shop's reason about different tools and products might not be a solid justification. If they can cut men's hair, they might be able to do it regardless of hair texture. The real issue is the religious policy against touching women's hair, which might not be a valid business reason in a legal context.\n\nConsidering all this, the shop might be in the wrong if their policy is seen as discriminatory against transgender individuals. The fact that they have a female barber available could mean they can accommodate, but they're not doing so because of the customer's gender presentation. The manager's explanation about employees not being trained in women's hair might not hold up if the actual issue is religious, which might not be a valid business reason for refusal of service in many jurisdictions.\n\nSo the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong. But I need to confirm if the shop's policy is legally permissible. In some places, businesses can have such policies if they're based on religious beliefs, but in others, it's considered discrimination. If the customer is a transgender man, the shop's policy based on biological sex could be discriminatory. Without knowing the specific location's laws, but assuming general principles, the answer would be A.\n"
