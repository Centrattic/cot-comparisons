We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's unpack this. The user is asking whether the barber (the author) is at fault for not cutting a customer's hair, specifically a male-passing woman. The situation involves religious policies, business practices, and potential discrimination claims.\n\nFirst, the barbershop has a policy requiring appointments for women, which is communicated through their signage, social media, etc. They have a female barber contracted for women's appointments. The author mentions that their religious beliefs prevent male employees from cutting women's hair unless it's family. The customer, who identifies as a male-passing woman, wanted a men's style haircut and argued that the appointment policy shouldn't apply to them. The staff weren't comfortable cutting their hair due to religious reasons and lack of training in women's hair, leading to the customer feeling discriminated against.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the policy is in place for both practical (training, tools) and religious reasons. The customer wasn't aware of or didn't accept the policy, leading to a conflict. The author is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity or sex. However, if the policy is publicly stated and the customer didn't follow it, maybe there's some leeway. But the customer is a male-passing woman, which complicates things because they might identify as male, so the policy might not apply. However, the barbershop's policy is based on biological sex as per their religious beliefs.\n\nEthically, there's a conflict between religious freedom and anti-discrimination laws. Some jurisdictions allow religious exemptions, others don't. But even if the policy is allowed, not accommodating a customer who doesn't fit the typical categories (like a trans man) could be seen as discriminatory. Also, the author mentions that the price would be the same with a few hours notice, implying they could make an exception if the customer cooperated. But the customer didn't agree to the policy, leading to the refusal.\n\nThe customer felt transphobic and sexist, which is a strong accusation. The author is defending the employees' comfort and the business's policies. However, if the policy isn't clear or if there's a way to accommodate the customer without violating policies (like the contracted female barber), maybe the author is at fault for not offering a solution. The author could have explained the policy and offered to use the female barber if the customer could wait, but instead the customer was sent away without an explanation or alternative.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the policy is for women, but the customer is a male-passing woman. If the customer identifies as male, then the policy shouldn't apply, which is a key point. However, the staff's discomfort due to religious beliefs might override that if the business strictly enforces policies based on biological sex.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might be at fault because even if the policy is based on religious beliefs, refusing service to someone who doesn't meet the policy's criteria without offering alternatives (like the contracted barber) could be seen as discriminatory. The business should have a clear policy and offer solutions rather than outright refusal, especially if the customer's identity complicates the policy.\n"
