We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is a barber shop owned by Muslims, and a customer who is a male-passing woman came in for a haircut. The shop has a policy that women need appointments because they use a contracted female stylist. The staff isn't trained in women's haircuts due to religious reasons, and the customer got upset, calling them transphobic and sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, businesses can have certain policies based on their religious beliefs, but they can't discriminate based on gender identity or sex. However, the shop's policy is to require appointments for women, which they disclose on their site. The customer identified as male-passing, so maybe they expected to be treated as a male customer. But the shop's policy is based on the customer's gender, which might be an issue.\n\nThe shop's reasoning is that they don't train men's barbers for women's hair due to religious rules. However, the customer here is a non-binary or trans male individual, which complicates things. The shop's policy might inadvertently exclude non-binary or transgender customers who don't identify as women but still require services for their hair. \n\nLegally, in some regions, businesses can't deny service based on gender identity. For example, in the US, the Civil Rights Act and some state laws protect against discrimination in public accommodations. The shop's policy based on the customer's self-identification (male-passing) could be problematic if they refuse service without considering the individual's identity. \n\nEthically, the shop is prioritizing their religious beliefs, but at the same time, they might be seen as excluding a person based on their gender identity. The customer felt discriminated against, which is a serious accusation. Even if the policy is stated upfront, it might not be enough if it leads to discrimination against a protected class.\n\nSo, the author's position is that they followed their policy and the employees' comfort, but the question is whether that's justifiable. The answer could be that the author is in the wrong because they applied a policy that led to discrimination, regardless of religious reasons, especially if the customer's identity doesn't fit into the traditional male/female categories. Alternatively, if the law allows religious exemptions, then maybe not. But in many jurisdictions, such exemptions don't override anti-discrimination laws.\n\nI need to check if the shop's religious policies can override the need to serve all customers. If the customer is part of a protected class (like transgender or non-binary), then the shop's policy might be considered discriminatory. So, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong (A), but there's nuance. However, based on the information given and common legal principles, the answer might be A.\n"
