We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the barber is in the wrong here. The situation is that a customer who is a male-passing woman came in for a haircut, but the shop has a policy requiring appointments for women because they don't have female barbers trained for women's hair, and religious reasons prevent them from touching women's hair unless it's family. The customer wasn't satisfied and accused them of being transphobic and sexist.\n\nFirst, the shop's policy is clear online and in the store, right? They mention on their website and social media that they have a female barber available by appointment. The customer might not have checked that, but the policy is stated. So maybe the customer is at fault for not checking the policy beforehand. However, the customer identifies as male-passing, which complicates things. If they present as male, the shop might not realize they're a woman until they ask for a haircut. But the shop's policy is based on gender, which could be problematic if they can't determine gender at first glance. \n\nThe religious aspect is a key point. The shop's employees have varying levels of religious adherence, but they have a rule based on Islamic teachings regarding touching women's hair. The female stylist isn't there to serve women, but the shop requires appointments for women specifically. This policy might be seen as discriminatory because it's based on gender, especially if the customer's gender isn't immediately apparent. \n\nAlso, the shop's policy could be transphobic if the customer identifies as male but is assigned female at birth. The shop's refusal to cut their hair based on perceived gender could be seen as not respecting the customer's identity. The customer might feel that their gender expression is male, so they should be treated like any other male customer. \n\nThe shop manager is trying to protect their employees' comfort levels and religious beliefs. But is that a valid reason to deny service? In some places, anti-discrimination laws might protect against such practices if they're based on gender identity or expression. However, if the policy is based on the biological sex of the customer, it's a different scenario. But the customer here is transgender, which adds another layer. \n\nThe shop's reasoning about different hair textures and tools is a practical concern, but maybe that's an excuse to avoid accommodating transgender customers. The female barber is available for appointments, but the customer might not have had one. The manager offered to contact the female employee, but the customer refused. \n\nSo, the manager followed the shop's policy and the employees' religious beliefs, but that could be seen as discriminatory against transgender individuals. The key issue is whether the policy is based on biological sex, which might not align with the customer's gender identity. If the customer identifies as male, their gender is recognized, and the shop's policy should serve them as male customers. Therefore, the manager might be in the wrong for enforcing a policy that doesn't respect the customer's gender identity, leading to accusations of transphobia. However, if the policy is based on the customer's assigned sex, then maybe the shop isn't at fault. \n\nBut in modern contexts, businesses are often expected to accommodate gender identity. The manager's refusal could be discriminatory, even if based on religious beliefs. There's a conflict between religious freedom and anti-discrimination laws here. The answer might depend on local laws, but the question is more about ethical judgment. The manager's actions might be seen as wrong because they didn't accommodate the customer's gender identity, even if the policy is clear. The customer's experience is being treated as a woman, which they don't identify with, leading to negative labels. \n\nIn conclusion, the manager is likely in the wrong because the policy doesn't account for gender identity, and the shop's refusal to adjust based on the customer's identity leads to discrimination. The answer is A.\n"
