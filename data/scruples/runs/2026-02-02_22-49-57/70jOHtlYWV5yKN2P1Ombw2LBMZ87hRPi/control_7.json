We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of a \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves a barber who didn't cut a customer's hair because the customer was a male-passing woman, and the shop has a policy of requiring appointments for women. The shop has a woman barber who works on an appointment basis, and the policy is stated on their website and signs. The employees are mostly Muslim, and they follow a religious rule that men shouldn't cut women's hair unless it's family, but the reverse isn't an issue. The customer felt discriminated against and called them transphobic and sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break down the key points. The shop has a clear policy about requiring appointments for women, which is communicated upfront. The customer, however, identified as a male-passing woman, which complicates things because the policy might not account for transgender or non-binary individuals. The shop's policy is based on religious beliefs and the lack of training for women's hair, but the customer's situation doesn't fit neatly into the existing categories.\n\nReligious exemptions sometimes allow businesses to decline services based on sincerely held beliefs, but there are limits. In many places, discrimination based on gender identity is prohibited, even if a business cites religious reasons. The customer's experience of being denied service because of their gender identity could be seen as discriminatory. The shop's policy might not be inclusive of all genders, especially those who don't fit traditional male or female categories. \n\nThe author argues that they need to protect their employees' religious beliefs and the quality of service. However, the customer's right to service without discrimination should also be considered. The fact that the shop could have accommodated the customer by rescheduling or contacting the female barber suggests that the policy might not be strictly necessary in this case. The customer's frustration is valid if they felt forced to out themselves or face denial of service.\n\nLegal considerations vary by location, but in many areas, businesses can't refuse service based on gender identity, even if it's under the guise of religious freedom. The shop's policy might be well-intentioned but could unintentionally exclude people who don't fit into the male/female binary. The author's insistence on the policy without flexibility could be seen as the wrong approach here.\n\nOn the other hand, if the shop's policy is clearly communicated and followed equally for everyone, they might not be at fault. But since the customer identified as a male-passing woman, the policy might not have been applied correctly. The shop's refusal to use the appointment system for someone who doesn't identify as female could be a point of contention. Also, the customer's right to privacy and not having to disclose their gender identity to receive service is important.\n\nIn conclusion, while the shop has stated policies and religious reasons, the situation involves potential discrimination against a transgender or non-binary individual. The author might be in the wrong for not accommodating the customer's needs despite the policy, especially if the policy doesn't account for all gender identities. The answer would likely be A (Yes), as the author's actions could be considered discriminatory.\n"
