We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The scenario is about a barber shop manager who didn't cut a customer's hair because the customer was a male-passing woman, and they have a policy requiring appointments for women. The shop has a female barber on call for women, and the staff isn't trained or comfortable doing women's hair due to religious reasons.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the policies they have in place. They mention they state on their signage, website, etc., that women need appointments. So if the customer wasn't booked for an appointment, maybe they were aware of the policy. But the customer identified as male-passing, so they might not have considered themselves in the category that needs appointments. That's a point of confusion.\n\nThen there's the religion part. The shop is mostly Muslim, and the policy is based on religious beliefs about not touching women's hair unless it's family. But the customer is a woman, even if she's male-passing. The staff isn't trained for women's hair, which is another factor. However, the customer wanted a men's cut, which could be a point of contention. The staff might not be trained in women's styles, but if the customer is presenting as male, maybe the staff thought they weren't qualified regardless.\n\nThe customer felt discriminated against and called them transphobic, sexist, etc. The manager is feeling bad but also considering employee comfort and service quality. The key here is whether the policy is discriminatory. The policy is based on gender, which in many places is protected, so enforcing gender-based appointments could be seen as discriminatory. Even if the reason is religious, there are laws around equal access to services regardless of gender identity or expression.\n\nAlso, the fact that the shop is a business open to the public might mean they have to accommodate all customers without discrimination, regardless of religious beliefs. The Civil Rights Act in the US, for example, prohibits places of public accommodation from discriminating based on race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. But this can be a complex area, especially with religious exemptions. However, in many cases, businesses can't use religious beliefs to deny service based on gender identity.\n\nSo if the customer is a woman who is male-passing, the policy of requiring appointments for women might not apply if she's presenting as male, but the staff isn't trained for men's cuts either. Wait, no\u2014staff is trained for men's hair, but the policy is about the gender of the customer, not the style. The staff's discomfort is due to the customer's gender, not the style. So even if the customer is asking for a men's cut, the staff isn't comfortable cutting a woman's hair regardless of the cut.\n\nTherefore, the manager is enforcing a policy that discriminates based on gender, which could be illegal. Even if there's a religious justification, the law might still require the business to accommodate, unless there's an exemption. However, in many jurisdictions, businesses can't claim religious exemptions to discriminate against customers based on gender identity. So the author might be in the wrong for enforcing a policy that denies service based on the customer's gender, even if they're male-passing.\n\nAnother angle: the shop could have made an exception, especially if the customer didn't know the policy because they're male-passing. But if the policy is clearly stated, maybe the customer should have known. However, if the policy is based on gender and the customer's gender is a protected category, the shop could still be violating anti-discrimination laws. The author's reasoning is that they don't train for women's hair because of religion, but that's a policy that affects women and possibly transgender men. The customer might identify as male, but if they're a woman presenting as male, the staff's religious beliefs don't apply. If the customer is transgender, the situation becomes more complex. The shop's policy might be seen as transphobic if they deny service based on gender identity.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's policy and action likely violate anti-discrimination laws, making them in the wrong. The answer is A.\n"
