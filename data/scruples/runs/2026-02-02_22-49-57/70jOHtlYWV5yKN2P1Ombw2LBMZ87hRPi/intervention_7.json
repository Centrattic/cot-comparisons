We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario is a barber who refused to cut a customer's hair because the customer identified as a male-passing woman, and the shop's policy requires appointments for women due to religious reasons.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The barbershop has a policy stating they require appointments for women because they have a female barber who works on a contractual basis. The customer is a male-passing woman who wanted a men's cut but didn't have an appointment. The staff, including the manager, felt they couldn't cut her hair due to religious beliefs\u2014specifically that Muslim men shouldn't touch women's hair unless it's family. However, the customer felt discriminated against and called the shop transphobic and sexist. The manager is defending their position by saying they tried to explain the policy and that they prioritize employee comfort and service quality.\n\nNow, considering the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, discrimination based on gender identity is illegal. If the customer is presenting as male, even if they are biologically female, the barbershop's policy might be problematic. The policy is based on the customer's sex at birth rather than their gender identity, which could be seen as discriminatory. Also, the shop's policy might be excluding transgender or non-binary individuals who identify as male but were assigned female at birth. \n\nThe shop's reasoning is rooted in religious beliefs, but religious exemptions don't always override anti-discrimination laws. There's a balance between religious freedom and the right to equal service. The fact that the shop states their policy publicly does not automatically make it acceptable if it leads to discrimination. They also mention that they don't train for women's hair due to religion, which could further limit their ability to serve diverse customers.\n\nHowever, the manager's concern about employee comfort is valid. If employees aren't trained or comfortable doing women's cuts, it could affect service quality. But the solution here should be to offer appointments with the female barber they have, even if she's on a contract basis. The customer could have been informed that an appointment is needed, and if they couldn't wait, the shop might not be the right fit. \n\nThe customer's reaction was storming out and calling them names, which is not ideal. But the manager's refusal might have been a miscommunication. If the shop's policy is clear that women need appointments, the customer might have expected to wait or reschedule. However, if the customer identifies as male, the shop's policy based on biological sex might be misapplied here. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the shop is prioritizing their religious beliefs and employee comfort over the customer's right to service. If they can accommodate someone by calling in the female barber, then refusing without offering that option could be seen as discriminatory. The manager says they would have needed a couple of hours notice, but the customer might not have that, leading to a refusal. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, the manager might be in the wrong because the policy as applied could be discriminatory against transgender or gender-nonconforming individuals. The shop's stated policy is about biology, not gender identity, which might not align with the customer's experience. Even if the shop's intention is to follow religious guidelines, they might still need to adapt to legal standards regarding discrimination. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
