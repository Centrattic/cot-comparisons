We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a barber shop manager who's part of a Muslim community. The situation involves a male-passing woman who wanted a haircut but didn't have an appointment. The shop has a policy requiring appointments for women because they don't have female staff trained for women's hair, partly due to religious beliefs.\n\nThe key points here are the reasons behind the policy. The shop's policy is stated upfront on their website and Facebook, so the customer should have known about it beforehand. They mention that the staff isn't trained for women's hair and that there are religious reasons preventing male barbers from cutting women's hair unless it's family. Also, they contract a female barber when needed, but that requires an appointment.\n\nThe customer, who identifies as a male-passing woman, argued that since they want a men's style, the policy shouldn't apply. But the policy isn't about the customer's gender identity but about the staff's training and religious practices. The shop manager had to consider the employees' comfort and the service quality. The customer got upset and accused the shop of being transphobic and sexist.\n\nNow, considering the context, the shop's policy is clear and based on both religious and practical reasons. They made an effort to inform customers through their online presence. The manager tried to explain that they needed a few hours to get the female barber, but the customer refused. The manager's actions seem to follow the established policy and were trying to provide the best possible service given their constraints. \n\nIn terms of legal and ethical considerations, as long as the policy is consistently applied and doesn't discriminate based on protected characteristics, it might be acceptable. However, there's a line between policy and discrimination. If the policy could be seen as excluding transgender or non-binary individuals because of their gender identity, that's a different issue. But in this case, the policy was about the customer's self-identification as a woman, which relates to their stated need for a female barber due to religious reasons. \n\nSo, the manager's decision was based on the shop's policies and the staff's limitations. While the customer felt discriminated against, the manager wasn't intentionally targeting trans individuals but following a policy that's publicly stated. The answer here is likely B (the author is not in the wrong), because they adhered to their established guidelines and tried to accommodate by using the female barber when possible.\n"
