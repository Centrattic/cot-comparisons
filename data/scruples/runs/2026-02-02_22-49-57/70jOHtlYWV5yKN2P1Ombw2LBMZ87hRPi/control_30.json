We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a barbershop that primarily serves men, with a policy requiring appointments for women so that the female stylist can handle their hair due to religious reasons. A customer who is a male-passing woman comes in without an appointment and is denied a haircut. The customer accused the barbershop of transphobia, sexism, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity or sex. The US, for example, has laws under the Civil Rights Act that prohibit discrimination in public accommodations. If the customer is a woman (even if they pass as male), refusing service because of her gender could be illegal, regardless of the business's stated policies. The barbershop's policy might be based on religious beliefs, but that doesn't necessarily override anti-discrimination laws. \n\nNext, the ethical side. The barbershop claims that they can't cut women's hair due to religious reasons, which is a protected belief. However, the customer's gender identity complicates things. If the customer identifies as a woman, then the policy could be seen as discriminatory. If they identify as non-binary or male, but present as female, the situation is different. But the barbershop's policy seems to be based on the customer's perceived gender, which could lead to issues. \n\nThe barbershop mentions that they have a female stylist available by appointment. But the customer didn't have an appointment. The problem is whether the customer's gender is determined by their appearance. If the customer is a woman who passes as male, then refusing service could be discriminatory. The barbershop's policy might not account for gender identity, just appearance, which could lead to unfair treatment.\n\nAlso, the customer was accused of being transphobic, which is a serious charge. Even if the barbershop's intent was to follow religious practices, the effect is denying service to a woman, which could be seen as sexist. The staff's discomfort is another point. While they feel it's based on religious beliefs, the business might still be responsible for providing services without discrimination, regardless of employee discomfort.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, businesses can make exceptions based on religious beliefs, but if that leads to denying services based on gender, it's a gray area. The key is whether the customer's gender is being misread. If the customer is a woman (regardless of how they present), denying service would be discriminatory. If they are a man, then the policy is followed. But the customer's gender identity isn't specified here, which complicates the matter.\n\nThe barbershop's policy is clear on their website and signage, but that doesn't protect them from discrimination claims if they don't serve someone based on gender. The fact that they require appointments for women might be seen as a policy that excludes women unless they can get an appointment, which isn't the case here. The customer didn't have an appointment, but if they are a woman, the shop should have accommodated them by calling in the female stylist, even if it's not an appointment.\n\nIn conclusion, the barbershop's actions could be seen as discriminatory if the customer is a woman. The policy based on appearance rather than identity might not hold up, and the refusal to provide service without an appointment could be in violation of anti-discrimination laws. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
