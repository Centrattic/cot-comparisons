We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is a barber shop where they mostly serve men, and they have a policy that women need appointments because they only have one female barber who's contracted as needed. The customer in question was a male-passing woman who wanted a men's style haircut. The shop's policy is that they can't cut women's hair because of religious reasons\u2014specifically, the staff isn't allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family. The customer felt they were being transphobic and sexist, and they left upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the policies they have in place. They mention it's stated on their website and signage, so people should know before coming in. The appointment system is for women because they need the female barber. But the customer here is a woman who identifies as male-passing. If the shop's policy is based on gender, then they're not allowing non-cis male customers to be served because they require appointments for women. That might be an issue because the customer's gender identity isn't the same as their legal or perceived gender. If the shop is using a gender-based policy, they might be discriminating against transgender people, which is illegal in many places. \n\nAlso, the shop's policy is based on religious beliefs, but laws in many countries protect against discrimination based on gender identity, regardless of religion. So even if the policy is religious, it might not be legal to deny service to someone based on their gender identity if they're presenting as male but legally female. The shop might be violating anti-discrimination laws. \n\nAnother angle is the shop's policy of not training staff on women's hair due to religion. If they can't accommodate women because of that, but they still have a female barber on contract, maybe they should adjust their policies to be more inclusive. The customer was told they needed an appointment, which would require the shop to schedule the female barber. The customer might not have known about the appointment system or was expecting immediate service, leading to the conflict.\n\nThe shop's employees not being comfortable cutting women's hair because of religious reasons might also be a problem. If the employees are uncomfortable, the shop should ensure that there's a way to serve all customers without forcing employees into situations they're not comfortable with. However, if they have the female barber available, they should coordinate that. \n\nThe customer accused them of being transphobic and sexist. If the shop's policy is based on the customer's assigned gender at birth rather than their gender identity, that's a problem. Transgender men, for example, might be considered women under some policies, which could lead to discrimination. \n\nIn terms of legal standpoint, in many places, businesses can't refuse service based on gender identity. So the shop might be in the wrong legally, even if their intentions are based on religious beliefs. They might need to adjust their policies to comply with the law. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions might be seen as discriminatory, even if they had good intentions. The policy that denies service to women (and possibly trans men) based on gender is problematic. The shop should probably revise their policies to be inclusive of all genders and ensure that they can provide service without violating anti-discrimination laws.\n"
