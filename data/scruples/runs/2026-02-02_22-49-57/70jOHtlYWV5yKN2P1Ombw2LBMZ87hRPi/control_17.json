We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (manager of a barbershop) is in the wrong for not cutting a customer's hair. The customer was a male-passing woman who wanted a men's cut, but the shop has a policy that requires appointments for women because they have a female barber on contract. The shop's policy is based on their Muslim faith, where male employees aren't allowed to cut women's hair unless it's family. The customer accused them of being transphobic and sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity or sex. Even if the policy is rooted in religious beliefs, there might be laws that require accommodations for transgender individuals. The customer identified as male-passing but wanted a men's cut, so they might consider themselves a man for the purposes of receiving services. The shop's policy might be seen as discriminatory if they refuse service based on perceived gender identity, especially if the customer is trans.\n\nThen there's the religious exemption argument. Some places allow businesses to claim religious exemptions from anti-discrimination laws, but this is a gray area. The shop is primarily Muslim, but they do serve all customers. The key point is whether the policy is applied in a way that excludes people based on their gender identity without a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason. The shop does have an alternative (calling in the female employee), but it requires an appointment. However, if the customer can't wait for an appointment, is it reasonable to deny service? Maybe the shop could have offered to schedule an appointment with the female barber instead of turning them away immediately.\n\nAlso, the customer was upset and accused the shop of being transphobic. The manager's stance is about protecting employees' religious beliefs and ensuring proper service. But if the shop has the capability to provide the service (by using the contracted female barber), refusing based on the customer's gender identity could be problematic. The fact that the customer was male-passing complicates things, as they might be trans, which is protected under anti-discrimination laws in some jurisdictions.\n\nAnother angle: the policy is stated publicly, which is good, but if a trans man comes in and requests a men's cut, is it fair to deny him service because of the shop's policy? The shop's policy is for women, but the customer doesn't identify as a woman. If the policy is based on the customer's gender as they identify, then the shop might be within their rights. But if the policy is based on physical sex (as per religious beliefs), and the customer is trans, there's a conflict.\n\nIn some places, businesses can't refuse service based on gender identity, even if they have religious objections. So the manager might be in the wrong if the law protects against such discrimination. The shop's policy could be seen as a blanket policy, but if it's applied in a way that harms the rights of trans individuals, that's an issue.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the manager might be in the wrong because they refused service to a customer who identifies as male, even if the policy is based on their religion. The shop has a way to accommodate (using the female barber with an appointment), so denying service without offering that alternative could be discriminatory.\n"
