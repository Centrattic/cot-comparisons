We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is wrong here. So the situation is a barber shop run primarily by Muslim employees, and they have a policy that women need appointments so that the female barber can be called in. The customer was a male-passing woman who wanted a haircut but didn't want to wait for an appointment. The shop refused because their policy is based on religious reasons\u2014men can't cut women's hair unless it's family, but women can cut men's hair. The customer accused them of being transphobic and sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity or sex. If the shop is refusing service to someone based on their gender identity, even if they pass as a different gender, that could be illegal. However, religious exemptions might come into play. The shop's policy is based on their religious beliefs, so they might argue that. But the counter is that by having a policy that excludes transgender individuals, they might still be violating anti-discrimination laws.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The shop claims they're not trained in women's haircuts due to religious reasons. But if the customer is presenting as male and wants a men's cut, does the shop's policy still apply? The customer might feel that their identity should be respected, and the shop is not accommodating that. The shop's argument is that their policy is to serve all customers, but the way they applied it here might not be inclusive of transgender people.\n\nAlso, the shop's policy is stated publicly, which is good, but when someone doesn't fit neatly into the categories (like a trans person), the policy might not be flexible enough. The customer might have expected that if they pass as male, they could get a haircut without an appointment. The shop's refusal could be seen as not recognizing their identity.\n\nReligious freedom vs. anti-discrimination laws is a tricky balance. In some cases, courts have ruled that businesses can't use religious beliefs to deny service to LGBTQ+ individuals. So even if the shop's policy is based on faith, if it leads to discrimination, they might still be in the wrong. Plus, the shop's policy could be seen as excluding trans people by not allowing them to book appointments for women's services if they don't identify as such, but in this case, the customer wanted a men's cut. Hmm, maybe not. Wait, the customer was a male-passing woman wanting a men's cut. The shop's policy is that women need appointments. If the customer identifies as a woman but is presenting as a man, it's confusing. But the shop might not have a way to determine the customer's gender identity, so they have a strict policy based on appearance or sex assigned at birth. That could be problematic because it doesn't account for gender identity.\n\nIn summary, the shop's policy might be based on religious beliefs, but applying it in a way that could exclude transgender individuals could be seen as discriminatory. The customer was denied service even though they wanted a men's cut but were perceived as female. The shop's stance might not align with current social norms and anti-discrimination laws that protect gender identity. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not accommodating the customer's needs and possibly violating their rights.\n"
