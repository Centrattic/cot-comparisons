We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a barber who refused to cut a male-passing woman's hair because they only serve women by appointment, citing both religious practices and lack of training.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The barbershop is primarily Muslim, and their policy is based on religious beliefs about not touching women's hair unless it's family. They have a female barber on contract for women's appointments. The customer in question was a transgender or non-binary person who identifies as male-passing but wanted a men's haircut. They were denied service because the staff wasn't trained for women's hair and the policy requires appointments for women, even if the customer doesn't want a women's cut.\n\nNow, the author is asking if they're at fault. The possible angles here include discrimination based on gender identity, religious freedom, and business policies. The customer accused the shop of being transphobic and sexist. The barbershop's defense is that their policy is clear, and they have a system in place to serve women via appointments, which they extend to all customers regardless of their gender expression.\n\nI should consider legal aspects. In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity. Even if the policy is for cisgender women, applying it to someone who is male-passing might be seen as discriminatory. The barbershop's reasoning is based on religious beliefs, but that doesn't necessarily override anti-discrimination laws.\n\nAlso, the argument that they don't train in women's hair because of religion might not hold up if the customer is not a woman. The staff's discomfort due to both religious reasons and lack of training could be a factor, but if the customer isn't identifying as female, the religious rule about family might not apply. This could lead to a situation where the policy is being applied inconsistently.\n\nAnother point is the business's responsibility to accommodate all customers. The customer was willing to wait for the female barber but was told they needed an appointment. If the shop can't adjust their policy in such cases, does that constitute poor customer service or discrimination? The author mentions feeling bad but needing to protect employees' religious beliefs and service quality. However, employees' religious freedom vs. a customer's right to service is a balance that might tip in favor of the customer, especially if the customer's identity is not aligned with the policy.\n\nIn conclusion, the barbershop's policy might be discriminatory against transgender or non-binary individuals who don't fit the cisgender female category but still require services under the same policies. The author's stance could be seen as wrong because they applied a policy that inadvertently excluded someone based on perceived gender, despite the customer's request and willingness to comply with the appointment system if necessary. The key is whether the policy's application was in line with anti-discrimination laws and inclusive practices.\n"
