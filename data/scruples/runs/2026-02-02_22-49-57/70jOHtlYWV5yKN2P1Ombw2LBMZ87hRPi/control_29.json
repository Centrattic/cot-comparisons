We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break this down.\n\nThe user is a barber shop manager who primarily serves men. They have a policy that women need appointments because they have a contracted female barber for their cuts. The customer in question is a male-passing woman who wanted a men's style cut. The shop's policy is that employees (who are mostly Muslim) don't cut women's hair unless it's family, due to religious reasons. The customer was upset, called them transphobic, etc., and they had to send her away.\n\nFirst, I should consider the legal aspects. In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity or expression. If the customer is transgender and presents as male, does that fall under the same category as a cisgender man? If the business's policy is based on gender as per religious beliefs, but the customer identifies as a woman who is transitioning or presenting as male, this could be a conflict. However, the shop's policy is about gender (male vs female) for haircut services, which might not align with the customer's gender identity.\n\nThe shop claims they don't train employees in women's hair due to religion. But if the customer is presenting as male, maybe the shop should consider their actual gender identity rather than perceived gender. However, if their policy is strictly based on the customer's appearance (male-passing), then maybe they aren't considering the customer's identity properly.\n\nAlso, the shop mentions they require appointments for women to use the female barber, but the customer is a woman who wants a men's cut. If the shop's policy is based on the customer's gender as perceived, then they might be denying service to a transgender person. However, if the shop is following their own policy as stated (women need appointments), they might not be in the wrong from their perspective. But if the policy is based on the customer's sex as opposed to gender identity, that's a problem.\n\nAnother angle: the shop's policy might be seen as discriminatory if they're denying service to transgender individuals or non-conforming people. Even if the policy is for women, if the shop is using biological sex instead of gender identity, they might be violating anti-discrimination laws. In some places, businesses can't refuse service based on gender identity.\n\nThe employees are uncomfortable due to religious reasons. But there's a balance between religious freedom and anti-discrimination laws. The shop might argue their religious beliefs, but if that leads to discrimination, they might be on the wrong side legally and ethically.\n\nThe customer was upset and called them transphobic. If the shop had an appointment system for women but the customer is a woman who wants a men's cut, maybe the shop could be accommodating if they could contact the female barber. However, the shop said they needed a couple of hours notice, which the customer wasn't willing to give. The customer might not realize the policy is based on gender, not the style of the haircut.\n\nIn terms of ethics, is it wrong to deny service based on perceived gender? If the customer is transgender, denying service could be seen as transphobic. However, if the shop's policy is clear and they follow it for all customers, maybe they aren't in the wrong. But if the policy is based on biological sex rather than gender identity, that's problematic.\n\nLegally, depending on the jurisdiction, businesses might be required to serve all genders regardless of the employees' beliefs or training. So the shop might be in the wrong if their policy doesn't account for gender identity.\n\nSo putting it all together: the author's policy is based on perceived gender (female) and religious reasons, but if the customer is a transgender woman presenting as male, the shop's policy could be discriminatory. The shop may be in the wrong because they're not accommodating the customer's gender identity and are enforcing a policy that could be considered sexist or transphobic, even if it's based on religious beliefs.\n"
