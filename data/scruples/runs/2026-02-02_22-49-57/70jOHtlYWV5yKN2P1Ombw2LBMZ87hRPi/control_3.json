We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a barber shop manager who's being asked if they're in the wrong for not cutting a customer's hair. The customer was a male-passing woman who wanted a men's cut. The shop has a policy where women need appointments because of religious reasons\u2014specifically, the Muslim faith prohibits them from touching women's hair unless it's family. They have a female barber on contract for women's appointments. The customer felt they were treated unfairly and accused the shop of being transphobic, sexist, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the shop's stated policies. They clearly mention on their website, social media, and signage that appointments are required for women. So the customer might have been aware of this. However, they presented as male-passing, which complicates things. If the customer identified as male or presented as male, maybe they didn't realize the policy was in place for women only. But the shop's policy is based on gender, which might not account for non-binary or trans individuals.\n\nThe shop's reasoning is religious. They don't train in women's hair because of their faith, so they can't serve non-family women. But the customer was a woman who might have passed as male. The shop staff wasn't comfortable cutting her hair because of the religious rule. However, the customer didn't have an appointment, and the female barber wasn't available that day. \n\nThe customer's complaint centers around being transphobic and sexist. If the shop's policy is based on traditional gender roles from their religion, that could be seen as discriminatory in a secular context, especially if the customer doesn't conform to traditional gender presentation. The shop's policy might not be inclusive of all genders or non-binary individuals. \n\nAlso, the shop's policy is to require appointments for women, which is clear. But if the customer was a woman who passed as male, maybe the shop didn't realize they were supposed to handle it as a women's appointment. However, the shop's policy is about the customer's gender, not their presentation. So even if the customer was passing as male, if they are a woman, the policy would still apply. \n\nBut there's a potential issue here: if the shop's policy is based on the customer's perceived gender, they might be excluding people who don't fit traditional gender roles. The shop might be violating anti-discrimination laws if they're not accommodating based on gender identity rather than biological sex. Also, the argument that they don't train in women's hair because of religion might not hold up if they can provide the same service for men regardless of appearance. \n\nOn the other hand, the shop is stating their religious beliefs as the reason for the policy. In some jurisdictions, businesses can claim religious exemptions, but that depends on local laws. However, if the customer is a woman (trans or cis) who is being denied service based on gender, regardless of their appearance, it could be considered discriminatory. \n\nThe shop's manager is trying to protect their employees' religious freedom as well. The employees aren't comfortable cutting women's hair, so forcing them to do so might violate their beliefs. But the customer's right to service might take precedence in some legal frameworks. \n\nThe key points here are: 1) The shop's policy is clear but gender-based, which might not be inclusive. 2) The customer was a woman who might not have known the policy applies to them. 3) The shop is using religion as a basis, which may or may not be a valid defense depending on the law. 4) The customer felt discriminated against based on gender and possibly transphobia. \n\nIn many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity or expression. If the customer is a woman (trans or non-binary) who is being denied service because of the shop's religious policy, that could be illegal. The shop's policy of requiring appointments for women might be seen as discriminatory if it excludes people who don't conform to traditional gender roles. \n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong because they are applying a policy that discriminates against individuals based on gender identity or expression, even if the policy is rooted in religious beliefs. The shop's stance could be considered sexist or discriminatory, especially if they offer the same service to men regardless of appearance. Even if they have a female barber, not having her available on short notice doesn't justify refusing service if the policy is discriminatory. \n\nSo the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because their policy, while based on religious beliefs, results in discrimination against transgender or gender non-conforming individuals by denying service based on perceived gender without exception.\n"
