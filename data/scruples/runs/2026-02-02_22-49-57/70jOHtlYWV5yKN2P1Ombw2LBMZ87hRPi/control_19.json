We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is a barber and manager at a shop that's mostly for men. They have a policy requiring appointments for women because their female barber is contracted on an appointment basis. The customer in question is a male-passing woman who wanted a men's style haircut. The shop's policy is clear they can't cut women's hair unless it's family, which is a religious rule they follow. The staff wasn't trained on women's hair due to religious reasons, so they couldn't accommodate the woman. The customer got upset, called them transphobic, etc., and left.\n\nSo the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the policies in place and the customer's identity. The shop explicitly states their services for women require appointments, which is part of their business model and religious practices. The customer identified as male-passing but wanted a men's cut. However, the shop's policy is based on gender, not gender identity. The staff's comfort and religious beliefs prevent them from cutting women's hair unless it's family. The customer might have expected a different approach, thinking their identity as male-passing should override the policy. But the shop's policy is clear and based on their operational and religious guidelines. \n\nThe author tried to explain the need for an appointment, but the customer didn't accept that. The author is concerned about employees' comfort and providing proper service. The question is whether not cutting the hair, based on the shop's stated policies and religious reasons, is discriminatory. In many places, businesses can have policies based on gender for services that require opposite gender employees, especially when it's tied to religious beliefs. However, there's a line between policy enforcement and discrimination. If the customer identifies as male but is perceived as female, the shop's policy might not account for that. But if the policy is based on biological sex and the customer is a woman, then it's within their rights. The author might not be in the wrong if they followed their stated policies and the customer's request doesn't fit the exceptions. However, if the policy is seen as excluding transgender individuals based on their identity, it could be problematic. The answer hinges on whether the shop's policy is considered discriminatory under their religion and the customer's gender identity. But given the context of religious exemptions, they might be within their rights. So the answer is B (No).\n"
