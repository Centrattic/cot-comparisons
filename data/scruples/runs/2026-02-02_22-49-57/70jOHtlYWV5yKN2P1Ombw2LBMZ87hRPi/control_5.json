We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author (a barber shop manager) is in the wrong for not cutting a customer's hair. The customer was a male-passing woman who wanted a men's style haircut, but the shop has a policy that women need appointments to be served by the female barber. The shop's policy is based on religious reasons\u2014specifically, the Muslim employees aren't allowed to touch women's hair unless they're family, and they don't train in women's hair. However, they don't have this restriction for women serving men, so the female barber can work with male customers. The customer felt discriminated against and called them transphobic, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity or expression. The customer identified as male-passing, so maybe they see themselves as a man. If the shop's policy is to require appointments for women but allows men to be served immediately, then if the customer is a man, the policy would apply. However, if the customer is transgender, this could be a case of gender discrimination. The shop's policy might be considered discriminatory if it's applied based on perceived gender rather than the actual legal gender. But the shop states that they require appointments for women because of religious reasons. There's a conflict between religious accommodation and anti-discrimination laws.\n\nIn the US, under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, employers can make accommodations for religious practices, but they can't use religion to discriminate against others. However, places of public accommodation (like barber shops) are prohibited from discriminating based on gender identity. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) might have different rules for employers vs. public accommodations. If the shop is considered a public accommodation, then they can't discriminate against customers based on gender identity, even if it's for religious reasons.\n\nThe shop's policy is that women must have appointments. If the customer is a transgender man, then the shop's policy is denying him service based on his gender identity, which could be illegal. Even if he's not transgender, if he's a cisgender woman who presents as male and the shop's policy is based on biological sex, that could still be a problem. But if the policy is based on gender identity, then the shop would need to adjust their policy.\n\nThe shop's reasoning is that they can't have male employees cutting women's hair due to religious beliefs, but they allow the female barber to cut men's hair. That seems inconsistent if the issue is based on gender rather than biological sex. The customer is seeking a men's haircut, which would typically be handled by male barbers, but the shop's policy is blocking them based on perceived gender. This inconsistency might be a key point.\n\nAnother angle is the shop's explanation about training and tools. They say they don't train in women's hair because of religious reasons, but if the customer is requesting a men's cut, maybe that's not an issue. However, if the customer is a woman asking for a men's style, the shop's policy is still applying the female-only appointment rule regardless of the haircut style. That seems like the policy is based on gender, not the type of service requested.\n\nThe customer's reaction of calling them transphobic might be valid if the policy is applied based on gender identity. The shop's stance could be seen as discriminatory, especially if they have the ability to accommodate (by calling in the female barber with a few hours notice) but refused. They have an employee who can handle women's hair, so the refusal isn't about capability but about policy.\n\nLegally, in many jurisdictions, businesses cannot deny service based on gender identity. The shop's policy may be violating anti-discrimination laws, even if it's rooted in religious beliefs. However, there have been cases where religious exemptions are considered, but public accommodations generally can't use religion to deny service based on gender identity.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's policy might be in violation of anti-discrimination laws, making them at fault. The answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) if the law prohibits such discrimination. However, if the law allows religious exemptions for public accommodations, then maybe not. But in most places, especially in the US, Title VII and the Equality Act would protect against gender identity discrimination. So the answer is likely A.\n"
