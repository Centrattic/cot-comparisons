We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The author is a barber and manager at a shop that's mostly Muslim, serving mostly men. They have a policy requiring appointments for women because they only have one female barber who works on a contract basis. The situation involves a non-binary or male-passing woman who wanted a men's haircut but wasn't allowed due to the shop's policy. The customer got upset, accused the shop of being transphobic, sexist, etc., and left.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The shop's policy is to require appointments for women because they don't have male employees who can cut women's hair due to religious beliefs. They mention that the female barber is contracted for appointments. The customer here identifies as male-passing but wanted a men's cut. The author refused because of the policy, even though the customer's gender identity might be different.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to evaluate based on the situation. Let's consider religious freedom versus discrimination. The shop's policy is based on Islamic teachings where men are not supposed to touch women's hair, except for family. However, the customer is identifying as a man, so maybe the shop's policy is conflicting with the customer's self-identity.\n\nBut here's the catch: the shop's policy is to require appointments for women, not based on gender identity. If the customer is male-passing but identifies as a woman or non-binary, the shop's refusal might be seen as discrimination. The shop's reasoning is that they can't cut women's hair due to religious beliefs, but if the customer is presenting as male, perhaps the shop should make an exception. However, the shop's policy is about the customer's gender as perceived, not their identity. \n\nThe shop also mentions that they serve all sorts of customers, but their employees' comfort is a factor. They don't train male employees to cut women's hair because of religious rules. So if the customer is a woman, they can't be served unless the female barber is available. But if the customer is a man, it's okay. The problem is that the customer's self-identification as non-binary/male-passing complicates this. \n\nThe customer might argue that their gender identity should be respected, and the shop shouldn't impose policies based on perceived gender. The shop might argue that their policy is clear and based on religious principles. However, in many places, discrimination based on gender identity is illegal, and businesses can't refuse service based on that. Even if the policy is based on religion, there might be legal obligations to accommodate customers regardless of gender identity. \n\nAdditionally, the shop's policy is to require appointments for women, not non-binary individuals. If the customer's gender expression is male, maybe the policy isn't applicable. But the shop might not be aware of the nuances between gender identity and presentation. There's also the aspect of the shop not being trained or equipped to handle women's hair, which is a separate issue from the customer's gender identity. \n\nThe shop's refusal could be seen as discrimination if the customer is trans or non-binary, as they're being denied service based on their identity. Even if the shop is following religious guidelines, there's a conflict between religious freedom and anti-discrimination laws. Some jurisdictions allow for religious exemptions, but others don't, especially in public accommodations. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they're refusing service based on the customer's gender identity or expression, which could be considered discriminatory. The shop's policy is clear, but the customer's situation might not fit neatly into that policy, especially if the customer's gender identity is different from their assigned gender at birth. The shop's reasoning about employee comfort and religious beliefs might not override the legal obligation to serve all customers without discrimination.\n"
