We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the barber (the author) is in the wrong for not cutting a male-passing woman's hair because of the salon's policy and religious reasons.\n\nFirst, the salon has a policy that they state publicly: they have one contracted female stylist for women, and the rest of the staff (mostly Muslim) don't cut women's hair due to religious beliefs. The customer in question is a male-passing woman who didn't book an appointment. The author refused to cut her hair, explaining that they need the female stylist for women's cuts. The customer got upset, called them transphobic, etc., and left in a huff.\n\nI need to consider a few angles. Legally, in many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity or sexual orientation. So if the salon's policy excludes transgender women or non-binary individuals who present as male but identify as female, that could be problematic. However, the salon claims their policy is clear\u2014they contract a female stylist for women. If the customer didn't book an appointment, maybe that's a scheduling issue rather than discrimination. But the key point here is whether the customer's gender identity affects their right to service. \n\nThe author mentions they aren't trained in women's haircuts due to religious reasons. However, the customer is male-passing, which complicates things. If the customer identifies as a woman but presents as male, does that affect the salon's responsibility? Also, if the salon's policy is based on biological sex (male vs. female), that might not align with current anti-discrimination laws that protect against discrimination based on gender identity. \n\nThe author's stance is that they can't provide the same service because their staff isn't trained for women's hair, but the customer might argue that since they want a men's cut, the staff should be able to handle it. However, the salon's policy is about appointments for women, so maybe the issue is that the customer didn't follow the appointment system. \n\nAnother angle is the religious exemption. In some places, businesses can claim religious exemptions, but that's not universally accepted. The author's employees' comfort is a factor too, but if the customer isn't a woman biologically, does the religious rule apply? \n\nThe author might be seen as in the wrong if the policy discriminates against transgender individuals. However, if the customer is male-passing and the salon's policy is based on biological sex (not gender identity), then it's a bit more nuanced. But in many modern contexts, gender identity is the key, so excluding someone based on biological sex might not account for that. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) if the salon's policy discriminates against transgender individuals. Alternatively, if the policy is about appointments and the customer didn't book, maybe the author isn't wrong. But given the mention of being called transphobic and the legal standpoint, the answer leans towards A.\n"
