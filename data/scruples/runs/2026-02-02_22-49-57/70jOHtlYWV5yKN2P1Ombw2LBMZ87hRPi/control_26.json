We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a manager at a barbershop that primarily serves men and has a policy requiring appointments for women, which allows a contracted female stylist to handle those cases. The customer in question is a male-passing woman who wanted a men's cut but didn't have an appointment. The shop's policy, rooted in religious beliefs (Islamic guidelines about not touching unrelated women's hair and not being trained in women's hair), led them to refuse the service. The customer accused them of being transphobic and sexist.\n\nFirst, the question is whether the author (manager) is wrong. The policy is stated publicly, so the customer should have known. The shop isn't trained for women's haircuts due to religious reasons, which is a legitimate reason for the policy. However, the customer identifies as a woman but presents as male and wants a men's cut. The issue is whether the policy applies here. If the policy is based on gender (as per the shop's stated practice), then the customer, despite being a woman, might not have an appointment, so the policy would still apply. But if the policy is based on gender identity, there's a conflict. However, the shop's policy is about gender presentation and training, not identity. The customer's argument that they want a men's cut doesn't negate the policy's requirement for appointments for women. The staff's discomfort is also a factor. The shop's stance is that they can't serve women without appointments regardless of the customer's identity. The customer might feel discriminated against, but the shop has a religious and business justification. However, in many places, such policies could be considered discriminatory, especially if they conflict with anti-discrimination laws that protect gender identity. The answer hinges on whether the policy is permissible under local laws and ethical standards. If the policy is based on gender and not identity, it's more about the shop's religious practices, but if it's denying service based on gender identity, that's different. The case here is a bit tricky. The user might not be in the wrong if the policy is clearly communicated and based on their religious training, but there's a risk of violating anti-discrimination laws in some regions. However, the answer here might lean towards A (wrong) because the policy could be seen as discriminatory against transgender individuals, especially if the shop is in a place where such discrimination is illegal. Alternatively, if the policy is strictly about gender presentation and they are allowed under their religion to have such a policy, then B (not wrong) might be the answer. Need to check if the scenario violates any laws. In the US, for example, some states have protections for LGBTQ+ individuals. If the shop is in a state that doesn't allow discrimination based on gender identity, then the shop's policy could be problematic. But the user's reasoning is based on their religious practices and training. However, the customer in this case is a woman (trans woman) who is male-passing and wants a men's cut. If the shop's policy is based on the customer's sex assigned at birth or their gender identity, then it's a different matter. But the policy as described is about serving women via appointment because of the religious rule. If the customer is a woman (trans woman) but presents as male, the shop's policy might not apply, leading to a conflict. The user might be in the wrong if they refused service based on the customer's gender identity, even if they present as male. Alternatively, if the policy is about the physical act of cutting hair (different techniques, tools for women's hair) and the customer wants a men's cut, perhaps the policy doesn't apply. But the main issue is the religious rule about not cutting unrelated women's hair. If the customer is a woman, regardless of how they present, the policy would apply. However, the customer might argue that they are a man (trans man) but since they are assigned female at birth, the shop's religious rules prevent them from cutting their hair. This is a complex intersection of religious freedom and anti-discrimination laws. In many cases, businesses can't refuse service based on gender identity even if they have religious reasons. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong if the customer is trans and the shop's policy is based on their gender rather than their identity. But the user's situation mentions that the customer is a male-passing woman, which could mean they are a trans woman. If the shop's policy is based on the customer's perceived gender (as a woman) and their assigned sex, then refusing service could be seen as transphobic. However, the shop's reasoning is about their training and religious practices. The key is whether the policy is applied based on the customer's gender identity or their assigned sex. The answer depends on the legal context, but in many places, such a policy would be considered discriminatory. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong (A).\n"
