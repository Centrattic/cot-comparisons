We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is a barber and manager who didn't cut a customer's hair because they had a policy requiring appointments for women, and the customer was a male-passing woman. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the context says their salon has a policy that women need appointments to be served, and they have a female barber who's contracted for that. The signage and online info mention this. The staff's religious beliefs play a role here, as they're primarily Muslim and don't cut women's hair unless it's family. The customer argued they wanted a men's cut, but the appointment policy was in place to manage their female barber's schedule. The customer felt they were transphobic and sexist, and the author is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nSo, breaking it down: The salon has a clear policy stated publicly, which is that women need appointments. The customer, who is a male-passing woman, didn't have an appointment and thus couldn't be served by the male barbers due to religious reasons. The author tried to explain the need for an appointment but the customer was upset. \n\nNow, considering legal and ethical aspects. In many places, businesses can have policies as long as they don't discriminate based on protected characteristics. However, if the customer is transgender and identifies as a woman, or if their gender identity is part of the issue, that complicates things. But the policy is about women, not about transgender people. The customer here is a male-passing woman, so maybe they identify as a woman but present as male. \n\nThe key issue is whether the policy is discriminatory. If the salon is openly stating that they can't cut women's hair unless by appointment, and that's due to religious beliefs, is that acceptable? In some jurisdictions, religious accommodations are allowed for employees, but when it comes to customers, there might be anti-discrimination laws. For example, in the U.S., Title VII allows religious practices in the workplace but also prohibits discrimination based on sex. However, if the policy is based on the employee's religious beliefs and the business is making an exception by having a female barber, maybe it's considered reasonable. But if the customer is being turned away based on their gender, that could be problematic. \n\nAlso, the customer might not have had the opportunity to book an appointment because they just walked in. The author mentioned needing a couple of hours' notice to call in the female barber, but the customer might not have known that. The policy might be clearly stated on their website, but if the customer isn't aware of that, it's a problem. \n\nAnother angle is the customer's identity. If they are a woman who presents as male, but they are still a woman, the salon's policy of requiring appointments for women might still apply. However, if the policy is based on the customer's gender presentation rather than their gender identity, that could lead to issues. The customer might feel it's discriminatory because they are being treated differently based on perceived gender, regardless of their identity.\n\nMoreover, the term \"transphobic\" suggests the customer felt targeted because of their gender identity. If the customer is transgender and the salon's policy doesn't account for that, it might be problematic. But the author's reasoning is based on the customer being a woman, so if the customer is indeed a woman (trans or cis), the policy might still be a problem if it's not accommodating based on gender identity.\n\nIn some places, businesses can't refuse service based on gender identity. Even if the salon has a religious exemption for employees, the service to customers might need to be non-discriminatory. The fact that they have a female barber available on appointment basis might be a mitigation, but if the customer isn't given a chance to book that appointment because they walked in, that's an issue. The author might be in a difficult spot between religious practices and anti-discrimination laws. However, the answer might depend on the specific laws in their location. Without that, it's hard to say definitively, but from a general ethical standpoint, the salon's policy could be seen as discriminatory, especially if the customer is being denied service based on their gender. So the answer might be that the author is in the wrong (A), but I need to check all angles again.\n"
