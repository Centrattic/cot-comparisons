We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author (the barber manager) is in the wrong for not cutting a customer's hair. The customer was a male-passing woman who wanted a man's cut, but the shop only serves women by appointment, using their female barber. The shop has a policy stated on their website and social media, and the staff isn't trained in women's hair due to religious reasons.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the policies. The shop clearly states that they serve women by appointment only, which is a policy they've communicated publicly. The customer didn't book an appointment, so maybe the manager is following the policy correctly. But then there's the issue of the customer identifying as male-passing and wanting a men's cut. The staff's refusal might be based on the policy, but does that policy apply here since the customer isn't presenting as a woman in the traditional sense?\n\nNext, the religious aspect comes into play. The staff isn't allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, which is why they have the appointment system. If the customer is a woman, the policy is in place to ensure they're served by the contracted female stylist. However, if the customer is gender non-conforming, maybe the policy isn't clear on how to handle such cases. The manager might be applying the policy strictly without considering the customer's identity, which could lead to discrimination claims.\n\nAlso, the customer felt they were treated transphobically. If the customer is a transgender man, being treated as a woman by the policy might be invalidating. The manager's reasoning is about employee comfort and training, but refusing service without clear policy exceptions could be seen as discriminatory. The customer might argue that the policy is a barrier to their access, especially if they're not a woman by the shop's definition.\n\nOn the other hand, the manager is trying to adhere to the shop's stated policies and the employees' religious beliefs. They tried to explain the situation and offered to get the female stylist if there was notice, but the customer was upset. The manager's responsibility includes protecting employees' religious practices and providing quality service. However, in a public accommodation context, there are legal considerations about discrimination based on gender identity.\n\nIn many places, businesses can't refuse service based on gender identity, regardless of policies. The shop's policy might be in conflict with anti-discrimination laws. Even if the policy is stated, it might not cover transgender individuals who don't fit the policy's criteria. The manager might be in the wrong if the policy is being applied in a way that discriminates against a protected class. The key points are the clarity of the policy regarding gender identity and the legal obligations to provide service without discrimination.\n"
