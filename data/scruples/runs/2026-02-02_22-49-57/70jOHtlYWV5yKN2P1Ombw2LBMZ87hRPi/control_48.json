We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is a manager of a barbershop that mostly serves men and has a policy requiring appointments for women, with a female barber available on contract. The situation involves a customer who is a male-passing woman wanting a haircut but not making an appointment. The staff, due to religious reasons (they are Muslim and don't cut women's hair unless it's family), refused. The customer accused them of being transphobic and sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the policies in place. The shop clearly states that women require appointments and have a female barber available. The refusal here is based on both religious beliefs and policy. However, the customer identifies as a male-passing woman, which complicates things. The shop's policy might be based on the customer's biological sex, but the customer's gender identity is male-presenting. This could lead to a conflict between policy and the customer's gender expression.\n\nReligious exemptions are a tricky area. While the employees have the right to practice their religion, this must not discriminate against others. In many places, businesses can't deny services based on gender identity, even if it's due to religious beliefs. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) and other anti-discrimination laws might apply here, especially if the refusal is based on gender identity.\n\nThe shop's policy is aimed at providing service to women, but the customer's situation is ambiguous. If the shop's policy is based on gender assigned at birth, they might have a case, but if it's based on gender identity, that's different. The customer might feel discriminated against, especially if their gender expression is male. The key here is whether the shop's policy is inclusive of transgender or non-binary individuals.\n\nAlso, the shop's reason for not cutting women's hair is religious, but the customer wasn't looking for a female stylist. The shop could argue they can't accommodate due to religious training, but if they can't provide any service at all, that might be a problem. The fact that they have a female barber available on contract suggests they can serve women, but in this case, they couldn't because the customer didn't book in advance.\n\nThe shop might be in the wrong because their policy is too rigid and doesn't account for gender identity. Even if the policy is clear, if it leads to discrimination based on gender identity, then it's problematic. The customer's experience is important, and the shop's refusal could be seen as transphobic, regardless of the intention. The employees' comfort is a factor, but there might be legal obligations to provide service regardless.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because the refusal based on gender identity could be considered discrimination, even if it's due to religious beliefs. However, the religious exemption is a gray area. Different jurisdictions might have different laws, but in many places, businesses can't cite religion to deny services based on gender identity. Therefore, the shop's policy might not hold up, making the author in the wrong.\n"
