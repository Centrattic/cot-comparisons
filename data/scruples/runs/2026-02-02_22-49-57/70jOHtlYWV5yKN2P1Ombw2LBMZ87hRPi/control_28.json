We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation.\n\nSo, the person is a manager at a barbershop. They mention that they mostly serve men, with 99% being male customers, and there's one female barber who's on an appointment basis. The shop is primarily Muslim, and they have a policy that women need appointments because the male barbers aren't allowed to cut women's hair due to religious reasons. The employees' comfort levels with their faith vary, but the manager follows their parents' rule-abiding approach.\n\nThe incident happened when a customer who is a male-passing woman came in for a haircut. The customer wanted a men's style cut. The shop's policy requires appointments for women, but the customer argued it shouldn't matter because they wanted a men's cut. The manager explains that the appointment system isn't for customers but for the staff, as they can't cut women's hair unless it's family. The staff was uncomfortable cutting the customer's hair due to both religious reasons and lack of training in women's hair. The customer left upset, calling the shop transphobic, sexist, etc. The manager feels bad but also has to consider employees' comfort and service quality.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the manager's actions were correct. The key points here are the policy based on religious beliefs and the customer's gender identity. The shop has a clear policy stated online and in signage, which is important. However, the customer is transgender, identifying as a man but presenting as male-passing. This complicates things because the policy might inadvertently exclude transgender individuals.\n\nReligious beliefs can be a defense in some cases, but there's also anti-discrimination laws to consider. In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity, even if it's for religious reasons. The manager argues that the policy is for employees' comfort and service quality, but the customer argues it's transphobic.\n\nThe manager might be within their rights based on their religious beliefs, but if the law requires equal service regardless of gender identity, then there's a conflict. The customer's argument is that they should be treated as the gender they identify with, not their assigned sex. If the shop's policy doesn't allow any exceptions for transgender customers, even if they pass as male and want a men's cut, that could be seen as discrimination.\n\nAlso, the manager mentions that the female barber is available on appointment. If the customer could have been scheduled with her, maybe that's a solution. But the customer wanted a same-day service, which the shop couldn't accommodate. However, the customer might not have known about the appointment system or expected to be accommodated without one.\n\nIn terms of legal standpoint, in some areas, businesses must make reasonable accommodations for gender identity. The manager's refusal might violate anti-discrimination laws, making them in the wrong. However, if the law allows religious exemptions, there might be a defense. But the line is blurry here.\n\nEthically, the question is whether it's right to enforce a policy that excludes transgender individuals based on religious beliefs, especially when the business is open to the public. The manager's employees' discomfort is a valid concern, but the business has a duty to serve all customers equally, regardless of gender identity.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the manager might be in the wrong because the policy, while based on religion, could be discriminatory against transgender people, who are protected under many anti-discrimination laws. The answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
