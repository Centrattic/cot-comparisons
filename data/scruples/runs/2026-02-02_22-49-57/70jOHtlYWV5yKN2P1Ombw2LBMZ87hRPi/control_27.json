We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the manager of a barbershop is wrong for not cutting a customer's hair. The customer was a male-passing woman who didn't make an appointment. The shop has a policy that requires appointments for women because they have a female stylist who's contracted for those appointments. The manager explains that their religious beliefs prevent male employees from cutting women's hair, hence the appointment system to ensure women are served. The customer felt discriminated against and left angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. The shop's policy is stated publicly, so the customer should have been aware they needed an appointment for women's cuts. The manager claims they can't cut women's hair due to religious reasons, which is a protected belief. However, if the customer is a woman who identifies as such, not allowing them to be served by male staff could be seen as discrimination based on gender. But the shop does have a female stylist available, so maybe they're accommodating women through appointments. However, the customer in question was male-passing, so maybe they didn't identify as female. This complicates things because the shop's policy is based on the customer's gender, not their identity. \n\nAlso, the shop's religious beliefs are a factor. In some religions, there are restrictions on same-gender interactions, but this is more about the service provided. However, in secular law, businesses can't refuse service based on gender identity or expression. So even if the policy is in place, if the customer is a woman who doesn't meet the shop's gender criteria, the shop might be violating anti-discrimination laws. But if the shop is a religious institution exempt from certain laws, that might change things. However, the question is about whether the author is \"in the wrong,\" which is more of a moral or ethical judgment rather than legal.\n\nThe manager feels they have to protect their employees' religious beliefs and the service quality. But the customer was upset, calling them transphobic, etc. If the customer is actually a woman (cis or trans), then the policy is based on their gender, which could be discriminatory. If they are a man who presents as a woman but identifies as male, then the policy might not apply. The manager's reasoning is that the appointment system is for women because the stylist is female and the male employees can't cut women's hair due to religion. But if the customer is a man, then the policy shouldn't apply. However, the manager says the customer was male-passing, which is ambiguous. \n\nIn terms of ethics, the shop is making a choice that prioritizes their religious practices over serving a customer they perceive as female. If the customer is indeed a woman, then the shop's policy is gender-based and could be seen as discriminatory. The fact that they have a female stylist available for appointments might mitigate some of that, but if the customer didn't book an appointment, the manager is still refusing service based on gender. \n\nThe manager also mentions that the staff isn't trained in women's hair, but if the customer is a man, then the training isn't an issue. However, if they're allowing men to get cuts without appointments because they're male, then the policy is inconsistently applied. \n\nSo, if the customer is a woman who didn't book an appointment, the shop's policy is in place, but the manager is still refusing service because of gender, which could be considered discriminatory. If the customer is a man who presents as a woman, then the policy doesn't apply, and the manager's refusal is based on incorrect gender assessment. \n\nIn terms of the answer, the manager might not be in the wrong from a religious standpoint and their stated policies, but from a societal and legal perspective, if the customer is a woman, refusing service based on gender is discriminatory. However, the shop does have a female stylist available, so they are providing service, just requiring appointments. The manager's responsibility is to enforce their policies as stated, but if the customer didn't know, maybe the signage wasn't clear enough. The manager's explanation about religious reasons is valid, but the execution might be problematic.\n\nConsidering all factors, the manager might not be in the wrong from their perspective, but others could see it as discriminatory. The answer is likely B (No), because the manager followed their stated policy and the shop has a way to serve women through appointments. However, the way it's framed could be seen as transphobic if the customer's gender identity isn't respected. The key is whether the customer is a woman by identity or gender presentation. If the customer is non-binary or trans, the policy might not apply, but the manager's policy is based on physical gender. This is a tricky area where religious freedom and anti-discrimination intersect. In many places, businesses can't refuse service based on gender identity, so the manager might be violating that. But if the shop is exempt due to religious status, it's different. The question is whether the manager is wrong morally, not legally. If the manager acted in good faith, following their own policies and beliefs, they might not be wrong. However, the public backlash and the customer's perspective is important. The manager might not be in the wrong (B), but there's a strong argument for A. However, given the information, the manager's policy is in place, and they have a system to serve women. The customer didn't follow the policy, so the manager isn't wrong. But if the customer is non-binary, the policy might not apply. The answer is B.\n"
