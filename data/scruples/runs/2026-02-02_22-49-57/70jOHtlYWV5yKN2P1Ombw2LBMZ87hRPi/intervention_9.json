We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the barber is in the wrong for not cutting a male-passing woman's hair because they have a policy of requiring appointments for women and their staff isn't trained for women's hair due to religious reasons.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The barbershop primarily serves men, and they have a policy that appointments are required for women. They have a contracted female stylist who's only available by appointment. The customer in question is a male-passing woman who wanted a men's cut. The staff didn't feel comfortable because of religious rules about not touching women's hair unless family. The customer then accused them of being transphobic and sexist.\n\nThe author, as the manager, is asking if they're at fault. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. So, I need to analyze the legal and ethical aspects here.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity or sex. However, religious exemptions might apply. But the issue is whether the policy is considered discriminatory. The barbershop's policy is that they can't serve women unless through a female stylist, which might be seen as a blanket policy against serving women, which is problematic. However, the staff's religious beliefs might complicate this.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, religious practices can be a defense against discrimination claims, but this is tricky. The key here is whether the business is denying service based on the customer's gender identity. If the customer identifies as a woman but presents as male, the business's policy might conflict with anti-discrimination laws that protect gender identity. However, if the policy is based on the customer's biological sex (which is what the staff is comfortable with), it might be a different scenario.\n\nAlso, the barbershop states they serve all sorts of customers, which suggests they don't have a policy of refusing service to women. The policy is more about requiring appointments to bring in the female stylist. But in this case, the customer was not a woman by their policy's terms (since they're male-passing and wanted a men's cut), but the staff still refused. That might be an inconsistency. If the customer is perceived as male, but the staff is using their biological sex to determine service, that could be an issue.\n\nAnother angle is the training aspect. The staff isn't trained for women's hair, but the customer isn't being served because of their gender identity. However, if the business can't accommodate them due to staff training (even if it's due to religious beliefs), that might still be considered discrimination. Some places have laws requiring businesses to make reasonable accommodations for religious practices, but those usually relate to the employees' needs, not the business's refusal to serve customers based on the employees' beliefs.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the customer's gender identity. If the customer identifies as a woman but is presenting in a way that others might not recognize, the business's policy based on their physical appearance might not align with the customer's gender identity. This could lead to accusations of transphobia.\n\nIn conclusion, the situation is complex. The business's policy is based on religious beliefs, but the refusal to serve a customer who they might not even be aware is a woman (since they pass as male) could be seen as discriminatory. The key factors are the legal protections in their area, the specific wording of anti-discrimination laws, and whether the business is making exceptions or following through on their stated policies. If the policy is that women need appointments, but the customer is not being recognized as a woman, then the business isn't following their policy. However, if the staff is refusing based on the customer's biological sex despite the customer's gender identity, that's another layer. Depending on the jurisdiction, this could be considered discrimination. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong if the law protects against such discrimination.\n"
