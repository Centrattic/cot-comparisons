We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not cutting a customer's hair. The situation involves a barbershop that mainly serves men, with a female barber available by appointment. The customer was a male-passing woman who wanted a men's haircut without an appointment. The barbershop's policy requires appointments for women because of religious reasons\u2014they don't train in women's haircutting. The customer felt they were transphobic and sexist.\n\nFirst, the barbershop has a stated policy that's clear on their signage and online. The customer might not have checked ahead, but the policy is in place. The staff isn't trained in women's haircuts due to religious beliefs, which is a protected right in many places. However, the customer is male-passing, so maybe they expected to be treated like a male customer. The author tried to explain the policy but the customer reacted negatively.\n\nOn one hand, the barbershop is within their rights to have policies based on their beliefs and practices. On the other hand, denying service based on gender could be seen as discriminatory, especially if the customer is trans or non-binary. However, the policy applies regardless of the customer's gender identity, as they're following religious guidelines. The key here is whether their policy is legally permissible and if they provided a solution (like scheduling the female barber). The author offered to contact the female barber with a few hours notice, but the customer refused. \n\nIn many jurisdictions, businesses can have policies based on religious beliefs, but they can't discriminate against protected groups. Since the customer is a woman (biologically or self-identifying), and the policy is clearly stated, the barbershop might not be in the wrong. However, if the policy is considered gender-based discrimination without a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason, they could be. The fact that they have a female barber available by appointment suggests they do serve women, just with prior notice. The customer might have felt their identity was being questioned by requiring an appointment despite presenting as male.\n\nBut the author's reasoning is based on the staff's religious beliefs and training limitations. If the staff isn't trained to cut women's hair due to religious reasons, and they have a system in place to accommodate women via the female barber, then they're following their policy. The conflict arises because the customer didn't want to make an appointment, possibly not realizing the policy or feeling it's unnecessary. The author isn't in the wrong if the policy is applied consistently and alternatives are offered. However, if the policy is based on the customer's gender rather than their actual needs (like hair texture), it could be seen as discriminatory. But since the policy is about the staff's training and religious beliefs, it's more about the shop's operational constraints. So, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
