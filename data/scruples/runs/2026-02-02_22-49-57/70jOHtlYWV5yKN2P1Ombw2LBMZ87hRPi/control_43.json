We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author (manager of a barbershop) is in the wrong for not cutting a customer's hair. The customer was a male-passing woman who wanted a men's haircut, but the shop requires appointments for women because the staff is primarily Muslim and has specific religious guidelines about not cutting women's hair unless it's family. The shop has a female stylist for those appointments.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender, gender identity, or other protected classes. Even if the shop has a religious exemption, can they enforce a policy that excludes transgender or gender non-conforming individuals? Some laws might require them to provide services regardless of gender identity, especially if it's a public accommodation. The shop's policy of requiring appointments for women might be seen as discriminatory if it doesn't apply equally to all genders. The customer was presenting as male and wanted a men's cut, so maybe they felt the policy was being applied unfairly here.\n\nThen there's the religious freedom angle. The shop's policy is based on religious beliefs, which may be protected. However, religious exemptions don't always override anti-discrimination laws, especially when it comes to public services. Courts have sometimes ruled in favor of businesses with religious objections, but other times have upheld the rights of individuals to access services without discrimination.\n\nThe shop's stated policy is clear on their website, etc., that they serve mostly men and use appointments for women. The customer might not have known that or might feel that the policy is discriminatory. The manager mentioned that they didn't train in women's hair because of religion, but that could be seen as justifying exclusion based on gender, which is problematic in many jurisdictions.\n\nThe customer was called transphobic, sexist, etc., but the manager argues it's about employees' comfort and policy. However, the manager is responsible for ensuring the business complies with non-discrimination laws. If the policy excludes certain individuals based on gender identity, that's a legal issue. The manager's stance might be based on religious beliefs, but if that leads to discrimination, the manager could be in violation of the law.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the manager might be in the wrong because the policy could be discriminatory, especially when the customer is a gender non-conforming individual who identifies as male. The shop's policy might not account for this nuance and could be illegally excluding them from service. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
