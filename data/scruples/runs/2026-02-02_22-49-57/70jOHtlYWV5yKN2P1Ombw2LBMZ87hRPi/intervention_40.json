We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is a barber and manager at a shop that's mostly Muslim, right? They have a policy where women need appointments because they have a female barber who's contracted. The customer was a male-passing woman who wanted a haircut but didn't have an appointment. The author explained the policy but the customer got upset, called them transphobic and sexist, and left. The author feels bad but also concerned about their employees and the service.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the policy. The shop has a rule up front on all their platforms, so the customer should have known about it. They require appointments for women because they don't have the necessary tools or trained staff to handle women's hair properly. Also, their religion plays a role in not allowing male barbers to cut women's hair unless it's family, but the female barber is there for that. So the policy is to ensure proper service and follow religious guidelines.\n\nNow, the customer was a woman who might not have an appointment. The author did their job by stating the policy. The customer was upset, but did the shop do anything wrong? The policy is clear, and they follow it for all women. The fact that the customer is male-passing might complicate things, but legally, if the policy applies to all women regardless of gender identity, then it's consistent. The shop isn't refusing service based on gender identity, just on the customer's sex as per their policy. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that they can't train in women's hair because of religious reasons. So they have a valid reason to require a specific employee. The customer's argument that they want a man's style might not matter if the hair texture and tools differ. The shop is trying to provide the best service possible with the resources they have. \n\nBut wait, does this policy violate anti-discrimination laws? In some places, businesses can't deny service based on gender identity. Even if the policy is written for women, if the customer is a transgender man, they might identify as male and expect the same service as cisgender men. However, the shop's policy is based on the biological sex of the employee, which might not align with the customer's gender identity. \n\nHowever, the author's stance is that the policy is for the female customers, and if the customer is a woman (transgender or cisgender), the policy applies. The problem is if the policy is based on gender identity, that's a different issue. But the user says they state the policy for women, so if the customer is a woman (regardless of gender identity), the policy is valid. However, if the customer is a transgender man, they might not be considered under the female policy. It depends on how the policy is written. If the shop's policy is to require appointments for people assigned female at birth, that's different from gender identity. But the user didn't specify that. \n\nThe customer might have felt that their identity as a man (passing) should exempt them from the female appointment policy. But the shop's policy is likely based on the need for a female barber, not on gender identity. Unless the policy is discriminatory in how it's applied, which is where the problem might lie. \n\nAlso, from a religious perspective, the shop is following their beliefs by not having male staff cut women's hair. But in a modern context, that could be seen as sexist. However, the presence of a female barber who can be scheduled might mitigate that. \n\nSo, the author is in a tough spot between their religious practices and potential legal or social implications. If the policy is applied without considering gender identity, they might be in the wrong. But if the policy is based on the customer's assigned sex at birth, then it's a different case. The user hasn't clarified whether their policy differentiates between biological sex and gender identity, which is a key point here. \n\nIn many places, discrimination based on gender identity is prohibited. So if the customer is a transgender man, the shop might be violating anti-discrimination laws by not accommodating them as they would a cisgender man. On the other hand, if the policy is clearly for people who are biologically female and they don't make exceptions, maybe they're not. \n\nBut the user didn't specify the customer's legal gender or the exact wording of the policy. The customer's reaction as transphobic and sexist suggests they felt targeted because of their gender identity. The author's point is about employee comfort and service quality. However, the shop is still providing a service for all women, and the customer might not fit into that category if they're a man, regardless of appearance. \n\nHmm. The answer hinges on whether the policy accounts for gender identity and how it's enforced. Since the user states that the policy is for women and they have a female barber available, maybe they are not in the wrong. But if the policy is based solely on gender identity and not on biological sex, that's a different issue. The user's explanation seems to conflate the two. \n\nI think the correct answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong if the policy is clearly stated and applies to biological women, not gender identity. But if the policy is based on gender identity, then A (Yes). Since the user mentions their religious rule about not touching women's hair, which is about biological sex, and the policy is for women, then it's not the author's fault. They provided an alternative in the female barber. So the answer is B.\n"
