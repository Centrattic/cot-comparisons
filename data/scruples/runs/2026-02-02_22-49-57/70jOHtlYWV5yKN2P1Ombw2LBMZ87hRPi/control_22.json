We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the manager of a Muslim barbershop is in the wrong for not cutting a non-binary customer's hair because they have a policy requiring appointments for women and don't have female stylists on staff. The customer identified as male-passing but was assigned female at birth, so the staff felt uncomfortable cutting their hair due to religious beliefs. The manager explained that they have a female stylist they can call, but the customer refused and left, accusing them of being transphobic and sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the policies and their implications. The shop states upfront that they have a female stylist for women's appointments, which is transparent. The issue here is whether the customer's identity as non-binary or gender-fluid affects the policy. The customer wanted a men's cut, but the staff's discomfort is based on the customer's biological sex rather than gender identity. However, the policy is based on gender as per the customer's assigned sex, not their gender identity. \n\nThere's a conflict between the religious beliefs of the employees and the customer's rights. The manager is trying to respect both, but the customer felt discriminated against. The key points are transparency in policies and religious exemptions versus anti-discrimination laws. In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity, but some religious exemptions might apply. However, the shop's policy is clear, and they offer an alternative (female stylist on call), so maybe the customer should have made an appointment. \n\nBut the customer didn't identify as a woman, complicating things. The manager's refusal might be seen as not accommodating a trans or non-binary person's gender identity, even if the policy is based on biological sex. Also, the staff's discomfort due to religious beliefs could be a factor, but if the shop is willing to hire a female stylist for women, they might need to adapt for non-binary customers who are male-passing. \n\nThe manager's actions were based on existing policies and employee comfort, but the customer felt excluded. It's a clash between religious practices and discrimination based on gender identity. Depending on local laws, the manager might be in the right for following their stated policies, but the customer's experience could be seen as a failure to accommodate their identity. The answer isn't straightforward, but I think the manager is not in the wrong because they provided a clear alternative and followed their policies. However, there's room for improvement in how they handle such situations to be more inclusive.\n"
