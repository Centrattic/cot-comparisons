We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author, who is a barber and manager, is in the wrong for not cutting a customer's hair. The customer is described as a male-passing woman who came in without an appointment, and the shop has a policy requiring appointments for women because their staff (mostly Muslim) isn't trained or comfortable cutting women's hair due to religious beliefs. The customer argued that they wanted a men's cut, but the staff didn't feel comfortable regardless. The author had to deny the service and faced backlash.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the shop's policies. They clearly state on their website and signage that they require appointments for women. That's part of their business model, probably to manage the availability of their female stylist. The customer might not have known or chose to ignore the policy, but the shop is within their rights to enforce it. \n\nNext, the religious aspect. The staff's discomfort is due to religious beliefs about not touching women's hair unless it's family. That's a personal belief, but in a business context, can they enforce that? It's a tricky area. However, the shop has a system in place (appointments for women) to handle these cases, which suggests they're accommodating the need. The customer didn't book an appointment, so maybe the shop isn't obligated to provide service outside their policies.\n\nAlso, the customer was trans and male-passing. If the shop's policy is based on gender as per the customer's self-identification, but the staff isn't trained to handle women's hair regardless of the customer's gender identity, there's a conflict. However, the shop's policy is about appointments for women, so if the customer identifies as male but the staff still treats them as a woman due to their appearance, that could be an issue. But the shop's policy is based on the customer's gender as presented. However, if the customer is trans and identifies as male, the shop might be required to serve them as a male customer under anti-discrimination laws. But the staff's refusal is based on religious beliefs, which can sometimes be a protected right. This is a clash between religious freedom and anti-discrimination laws.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, businesses can't deny service based on gender identity, even if the staff has religious objections. However, the shop's policy is about appointments for women, so if the customer is trans and identifies as male, the shop's policy might not apply. But the shop's staff isn't trained in women's hair, so maybe they can't cut hair regardless of gender. But the trans customer is seeking a men's cut, so maybe the staff should be able to serve them. However, the staff's refusal is based on religious beliefs about not cutting women's hair, which might be a conflict if the customer is trans and identifies as male. \n\nBut the key point is the shop's policy. If they have a policy requiring appointments for women, and the customer came in without one, the shop isn't obligated to provide service outside that policy. Also, the shop has a system in place to handle women's appointments, so the customer could have scheduled one. The staff's refusal to cut the hair might be based on their training and policies, not just the customer's gender identity. However, if the customer is trans and identifies as male, the shop's policy might not apply, leading to a potential violation of anti-discrimination laws. \n\nBut the shop is Muslim and has a specific religious policy. In some cases, religious businesses can have exceptions, but this is a public business, so they might be required to serve all customers regardless of gender identity. However, the staff's training and policies are based on religious beliefs, which might be a defense. It's a complex legal issue. \n\nThe answer might hinge on whether the shop's policy is based on the customer's gender identity or their biological sex. If the shop's policy is based on the customer's gender as identified, then refusing service to a trans male customer would be discrimination. If they are using biological sex, then the policy might not be inclusive of trans customers. \n\nIn summary, the shop has a policy that might not account for trans customers, leading to a situation where the author isn't following the policy properly. The customer was denied service not just because they were a woman, but perhaps because the shop didn't adjust their policy for trans individuals. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not accommodating the customer's request under the shop's stated policy, especially if the customer is trans and identifies as male. However, if the shop's policy is strictly based on biological sex and the customer is trans, the shop might be out of line. But the shop's stated policy is about appointments for women, so if the customer is trans and identifies as male, the policy shouldn't apply. The staff's refusal might be based on the customer's appearance, not their identity, leading to discrimination. \n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong for not adjusting the policy to accommodate the trans customer, even if the staff had religious objections. The key is whether the shop's policy is inclusive of trans individuals. If the policy is based on self-identification, then the author should have followed through. If the policy is based on biological sex, then the customer might not be covered, but that's problematic. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong for denying service to a trans customer who identifies as male, even if the staff had religious beliefs against cutting women's hair. However, the shop's policy might not account for trans customers, leading to a failure in adapting to include them.\n"
