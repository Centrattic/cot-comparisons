We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a barber and manager at a shop that's mostly Muslim, with a policy of requiring appointments for women because they have a female barber who's contracted as needed. The customer in question is a male-passing woman who wanted a men's style haircut without an appointment. The shop's policy is in place because they don't have male staff trained or comfortable cutting women's hair due to religious reasons. The customer got upset and accused them of being transphobic, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity. However, the shop's policy is based on religious beliefs. There might be a conflict here between religious freedom and anti-discrimination laws. For example, in the US, Title VII allows religious accommodations but also prohibits discrimination. But if the customer is transgender and identifies as male, the shop's policy might be seen as discriminatory if they refuse service based on perceived gender.\n\nThe shop states they don't train in women's hair because of religion, but if the customer is a male-passing woman, maybe they don't fit into either category. The policy requires appointments for women, so if the customer identified as a woman, they should be referred to the female barber. However, if they present as male, the shop might not have a policy in place for transgender men. This could be a gap in their policy.\n\nThe key issue here is whether the shop's policy discriminates against transgender individuals. If the customer is a transgender man, refusing service without an appointment (which is for women) could be seen as denying service based on gender identity. The shop's justification is religious, but religious exemptions might not override anti-discrimination laws in all cases.\n\nAlso, the shop's policy might inadvertently exclude transgender customers who don't fit neatly into the binary categories they've set up. The customer's complaint about being transphobic is valid if the policy doesn't account for gender identity. The shop's refusal could be seen as not accommodating the customer's identity, regardless of their appearance.\n\nIn terms of employee comfort and training, the shop's stance is understandable from a religious perspective, but they might need to adjust their policies to include provisions for transgender individuals. If they can't serve everyone, they should have a clear, inclusive policy that addresses different gender identities.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's policy may be in conflict with non-discrimination laws, especially regarding transgender customers. Therefore, they might be in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
