We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is the manager of a barbershop that primarily serves men, and they have a policy that requires appointments for women because they have a female barber who's contracted for those cases. Now, a customer who is a male-passing woman came in asking for a haircut, but since the shop's policy is for appointments for women, and the staff isn't trained to cut women's hair due to religious reasons, they couldn't serve her on the spot. The customer felt it was transphobic and sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the shop's stated policies. They mention on their website and signs that they require appointments for women. If the customer identified as a woman, even if they pass as male, the policy would apply. But the customer might have seen the shop as serving men only, so if they come in as a male-passing woman, they might not expect the same policy to apply. However, the shop's policy isn't just about gender but also about the employees' training and religious practices. The employees aren't trained in women's haircuts because of their religion, which affects their ability to serve trans women. \n\nThe author tried to explain the policy, but the customer didn't accept it. The key points here are whether the shop's policy is discriminatory. The shop isn't refusing service based on gender identity but on their policy about appointments for women. However, the customer might feel that their identity as a transgender man (since they pass as male) should override the policy. The shop's stance is that they can't serve women, which includes trans women, unless there's an appointment. \n\nReligious freedom arguments often come into play here. The employees have the right to follow their religious beliefs, but that could also conflict with anti-discrimination laws. In some places, businesses can't refuse service based on gender identity, even if it's for religious reasons. However, the shop's policy is to require appointments for women, which is a general policy, not specifically targeting trans individuals. \n\nBut the issue here is that the customer might not have known they were considered a \"woman\" under the policy, leading to confusion. Also, the shop's policy is in place to accommodate women, but they might not be clear enough about how they handle different gender identities. There's a possible conflict between the shop's religious practices and the customer's rights to be served without discrimination. \n\nThe author's responsibility is to enforce the policies they've set, but if those policies inadvertently exclude people based on gender identity, they might be in the wrong. The fact that the shop is primarily Muslim and the employees follow certain religious rules complicates things, but in many places, businesses must serve all customers regardless of religion. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong if their policy is seen as discriminatory against trans individuals, even if it's framed as a policy for serving women. The key is whether the policy is applied in a way that respects the customer's gender identity. The author's explanation about training and religious reasons might not hold up under anti-discrimination laws, which could mean the author is at fault.\n"
