We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author is a barber and manager at a shop that's mostly Muslim. They have a policy where women need appointments because they don't train in women's hair due to religious reasons. The customer in question is a male-passing woman who wanted a men's cut, but the shop couldn't accommodate her because of their policy and the fact that none of the staff were comfortable cutting women's hair. The customer accused the shop of being transphobic and sexist, and they left upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the religious aspect. The shop is primarily Muslim, and their religion might require male barbers not to touch women's hair unless they're family. That's a real religious practice. But does that apply to a male-passing woman? If the customer identifies as a woman but presents as male, it's tricky. The shop's policy is about appointments for women, so if the customer is considered male-passing, does that mean they should be treated as a male customer? But the shop's policy is based on gender, not gender identity. So maybe the customer is being categorized as female, which complicates things.\n\nThe shop stated their policy on their website, so the customer knew beforehand. The problem is that the customer didn't make an appointment. The author tried to explain that they need notice to bring in the female barber, but the customer didn't listen. The author says they felt bad but had to consider employees' comfort and service quality. \n\nReligious exemptions are protected, but they can't be used to discriminate against transgender individuals. The shop's policy is based on the gender of the customer, not their identity. If someone is a trans woman who is male-passing, is the religious rule applicable? If the shop's rule is based on the customer's biological sex, but the customer identifies as female, that could be a problem. However, the shop's policy is about appointments for women, so if the customer is presenting as male, maybe the shop is within their rights to serve them as a male customer. But if they are considered female by the shop's policy, then they need an appointment. \n\nBut the issue is the religious justification. The shop's employees are not trained in women's haircuts because of religion. However, if they are serving trans individuals who identify as female but present as male, does the religious rule still apply? This is a gray area. \n\nIn some places, anti-discrimination laws protect against gender identity discrimination. So even if the shop has a religious exemption, they might still be required to serve trans individuals. The customer might feel targeted because they were denied service based on gender identity. \n\nBut the shop's policy is clear: appointments for women. If the customer is male-passing but identifies as female, the shop might not have to accommodate them as a woman, but maybe they should consider gender identity over presentation. \n\nAlso, the fact that the shop is Muslim and has specific religious reasons for not cutting women's hair is a factor. But the U.S. (assuming this is in the U.S.) has laws that require businesses to accommodate exceptions for religious practices, but they also have anti-discrimination laws. So there's a conflict here between religious freedom and anti-discrimination. \n\nIt's possible the shop is within their rights if they have a clear policy and the customer didn't follow it. However, if the customer is trans and the shop is denying service based on gender identity, that could be a different issue. But the shop's policy is about appointments for women, not based on gender identity. \n\nIn this case, the customer didn't make an appointment, so the shop tried to explain they needed notice to get the female barber. The customer refused to listen and left angry. The shop's hands are tied because they can't serve women without the female barber, and they can't train their staff to do so due to religious beliefs. \n\nSo from the shop's perspective, they followed their policy and tried to explain the situation. The customer is at fault for not adhering to the appointment system. However, if the customer is trans and the shop's policy is based on gender presentation rather than identity, that could be an issue. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the shop has a stated policy and the customer didn't follow it, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But if the policy is based on gender identity, that's a different story. The key here is the shop's policy is based on gender (women), not gender identity. If the customer is male-passing but identifies as female, the shop might have a policy that doesn't accommodate gender identity. \n\nThis is a complex situation with both religious freedom and anti-discrimination considerations. Depending on the jurisdiction, the shop might be protected under religious exemptions, but they might also be violating anti-discrimination laws. However, the author tried to explain the policy and gave a solution (appointment), which the customer refused. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
