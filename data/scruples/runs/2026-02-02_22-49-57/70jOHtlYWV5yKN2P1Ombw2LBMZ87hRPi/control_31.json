We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a barber shop manager, primarily serving men, and they have a policy for women requiring appointments. The situation involves a male-passing woman who wanted a haircut but didn't have an appointment. The staff refused because of religious reasons\u2014Muslim employees can't touch women's hair unless it's family. The customer was upset and called them transphobic, etc.\n\nFirst, the shop's policy is clear: appointments for women. The customer didn't have one. The manager tried to explain the need for notice to bring in the female barber. The customer left angry. The question is whether the manager is at fault.\n\nFrom a business standpoint, they have a policy they communicate through their website, social media, etc. So the customer might have been aware but chose to skip the appointment. However, the person in question is a male-passing woman, so she might identify as male. The religious policy against touching women's hair could conflict with her identity. The staff's refusal could be seen as transphobic if they didn't accommodate her identity. But the shop's policy is to protect employees' religious beliefs and ensure proper service for women through the appointment system. \n\nThe manager is also considering employee comfort and the different needs of women's hair. But if the customer identifies as male, maybe the religious policy shouldn't apply. However, the staff's beliefs are important too. The manager had to balance these factors. \n\nThere's a conflict between religious accommodation and transgender rights. Depending on the jurisdiction, there might be laws protecting transgender individuals from discrimination. If the shop is in an area where transgender people are protected, then the manager's policy might be discriminatory. But if the shop's policy is based on their religious beliefs and they can't make exceptions, maybe they're justified. \n\nThe manager tried to explain the situation and offer a solution (appointment system), but the customer was uncooperative. The manager's actions were to maintain policy and employee comfort, but the customer felt wronged. It's a tough spot. The answer might depend on local laws and societal norms. If the law sides with the customer's rights, then the manager is wrong. If it's about religious freedom, maybe not. Since the question is general, without specific location, but in many places, transgender individuals have protections. So the manager might be in the wrong for not accommodating the customer's gender identity despite the policy. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
