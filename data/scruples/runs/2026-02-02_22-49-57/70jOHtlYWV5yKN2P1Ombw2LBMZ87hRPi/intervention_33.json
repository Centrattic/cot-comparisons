We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the barber is in the wrong for not cutting a customer's hair. The customer is a male-passing woman who wanted a men's haircut. The barbershop has a policy requiring appointments for women because they have a specific female barber contracted for that. The employees aren't trained in women's haircuts due to religious reasons, and they don't serve women on-site except through the contracted stylist.\n\nFirst, the key point here is the policy being followed. The shop clearly states they require appointments for women, which is communicated on their website, Facebook, etc. The customer didn't have an appointment, so the barber is adhering to the policy. The employee wasn't trained for women's hair, so they couldn't provide the service even if they wanted to.\n\nThe customer accused them of being transphobic or sexist. But the policy isn't about gender per se; it's about the shop's operational capabilities. They don't have the training or tools for women's hair, so requiring an appointment allows them to bring in the contracted stylist. The fact that the customer is a male-passing woman doesn't change the policy, as the shop's setup is based on the gender of the customer for service availability.\n\nFrom a business standpoint, they're following their own rules and prioritizing employee comfort and service quality. They also mention that the price would be the same with the appointment. The customer's frustration is understandable, but the shop isn't obligated to make exceptions to their policy unless they can provide the service safely and comfortably for both the customer and staff.\n\nReligious reasons might play a role in their training and policies, but that's their right as a business. However, there's a line when it comes to discrimination. If the policy is based on the customer's gender identity or expression, that's different. But here, the policy is based on the customer's gender (as per their own stated needs for appointments) and the shop's ability to serve based on that. Since the contracted stylist is available, the shop isn't refusing service entirely; they just need advance notice.\n\nSo, considering all that, the barber isn't in the wrong for following their established policy and being transparent about their service limitations. The customer might have felt it was discriminatory, but if the policy applies to all women equally (including trans women), then it's a business practice, not targeted discrimination. Therefore, the answer would be B.\n"
