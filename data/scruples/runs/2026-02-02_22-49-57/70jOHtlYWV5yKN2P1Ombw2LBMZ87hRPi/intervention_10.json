We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not cutting a customer's hair. The scenario involves a barber shop where they primarily serve men and have a policy that requires appointments for women because they only have a female barber on contract. The customer in question is a male-passing woman who wanted a men's style cut but couldn't get an appointment that day. The author mentions religious reasons for not having male staff cut women's hair, and that they don't train on women's hair. The customer left upset, calling them transphobic, etc.\n\nFirst, the key points: The shop's policy is clear (stated on their website, etc.) that they require appointments for women, which is to schedule the female barber. The author is Muslim, and their religious beliefs might influence the policy regarding male staff not cutting women's hair. The customer is a woman who identifies as male-passing but wants a men's cut. The author argues that they can't serve her because their staff isn't trained for women's hair and have religious restrictions. The customer felt discriminated against.\n\nNow, considering discrimination laws, in many places, businesses can't refuse service based on gender identity or sex. Even if the business has a policy, they might still be required to serve all customers unless an exception applies. However, if the business is a religious organization, there might be exceptions. But the shop isn't claiming to be a religious institution, just that some employees are devout. Also, the policy is about appointments, but if they can't fulfill the request due to staff training/religion, it might still be discriminatory.\n\nThe customer is transgender or gender non-conforming, and the shop's refusal could be seen as transphobic, even if the reasons are religious. There's a balance between religious freedom and anti-discrimination laws. However, the shop's policy isn't clearly accommodating for non-binary or trans customers, which could be problematic. The author's stance is that they need appointments for women, but the customer is a woman (trans or not) who wants a men's cut, so maybe they should still be required to serve her under general anti-discrimination laws unless there's an exception for religious reasons. However, the shop isn't a religious institution, so maybe their religious reasons don't override the customer's right to service. \n\nAlso, the shop states they serve all sorts of customers, which might imply they don't discriminate beyond the appointment policy. But the appointment policy is for women, which might not account for trans men or non-binary individuals. The customer's argument is that they should be treated as male for the purpose of the haircut, so they shouldn't need an appointment. The shop's refusal could be seen as not accommodating their gender identity. \n\nIn some jurisdictions, businesses can't have policies that exclude based on gender identity. Even if the staff isn't trained, the business might be required to make accommodations or face legal consequences. The author's reasoning about staff comfort and religious beliefs might not hold up in a legal context if there's no direct threat to others and if there's a reasonable accommodation possible (like calling the female barber even if it's last minute). The customer was upset and accused them of being transphobic, which the author might be, whether intentional or not. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong because they refused service based on the customer's gender identity, despite the policy being intended for cisgender women. The shop's policy might not account for trans or non-binary customers, leading to discrimination. Also, the religious reasons might not be sufficient to justify the refusal if the shop isn't a religious institution. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
