We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is a manager at a barbershop that mainly serves men, with a policy that requires women to make appointments because they have a female barber who comes in on a contract basis. The customer in question was a male-passing woman who wanted a haircut but didn't have an appointment. The shop's policy is that they can't cut women's hair due to religious reasons, and the staff isn't trained for women's hair.\n\nFirst, the author's barbershop is Muslim, and the policy is based on religious beliefs. They mention that they serve all sorts of customers but have specific guidelines because of their faith. The customer was told they couldn't get a haircut because the female barber wasn't available, even though they could pass as male. The customer felt this was transphobic and sexist, leading to a conflict.\n\nNow, considering the customer's perspective, they might see the policy as discriminatory because they're being denied service based on their gender identity or expression. If someone can pass as male, why are they being told they can't get a haircut there? It could be seen as a refusal to serve based on gender identity, especially if the customer identifies as male but is biologically female. That could be interpreted as transphobic.\n\nBut from the author's side, they have a clear policy stated on their website and signs. They rely on appointments for women to ensure that the female barber is available. They also mention religious reasons for not cutting women's hair. Their employees are uncomfortable, so they can't just do it even if they wanted to. The author is following the established policy and the beliefs of the staff, which are important to consider in a religious setting.\n\nHowever, there's a potential issue here. If the customer is gendering as male, does that fall under the women's appointment policy? The author might be applying the policy based on the customer's biological sex rather than their gender identity. But if the policy is only for women, which the customer isn't identifying as, then there's a problem. The customer might feel that they're being denied service because of their gender expression, not their biological sex. This could lead to accusations of discrimination against transgender individuals.\n\nAlso, the argument that they need the female barber for women's hair might not hold if the customer is requesting a men's cut. The texture and tools might differ, but if the customer is presenting as male, maybe the male barbers can handle it. The staff's discomfort due to religious reasons might be a valid point, but if the customer is trans, the staff's religious beliefs might not justify refusing service based on the customer's gender identity.\n\nIn some places, non-discrimination laws protect against discrimination based on gender identity. Even if the business has religious exemptions, there might be a conflict. The author's barbershop is primarily Muslim, but they are in a public space and might be required to serve all customers regardless of gender identity. The fact that they have a female barber available on appointment basis could be a way to comply, but if the customer is not identified as female due to passing as male, then the policy isn't being applied consistently.\n\nSo, the author's policy might not account for gender diversity, leading to discrimination. Even if the intention is to follow religious guidelines, there's a lack of consideration for transgender customers. The author might be in the wrong because the policy doesn't recognize the customer's gender identity and the refusal to serve could be seen as transphobic. The author is prioritizing the religious beliefs and lack of training over the customer's needs, which could be discriminatory.\n"
