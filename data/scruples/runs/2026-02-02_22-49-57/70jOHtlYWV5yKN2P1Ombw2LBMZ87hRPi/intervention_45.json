We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a barber shop manager in a primarily Muslim business. They have a policy that requires women to book appointments because the male staff isn't trained or comfortable cutting women's hair due to religious reasons. They have one female barber who's contracted for those appointments.\n\nA customer who identifies as a male-passing woman came in without an appointment and wanted a men's style haircut. The manager explained the policy, but the customer got upset, accused them of being transphobic, and left. The manager is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, first, the key points here: the shop's policy is clear about appointments for women. They state this on their signage and online. The reason given is both religious (not touching women's hair unless family) and practical (different techniques, products). They mention that employees have varying levels of strictness regarding their faith, but the policy is in place. The customer didn't follow the policy, and the manager couldn't accommodate them without the female barber, which would require an appointment.\n\nNow, legal aspects: In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity or sexual orientation. However, if the policy is transparent and applied to all women, it might be considered a legitimate business practice. The question is whether the policy is discriminatory. The shop isn't refusing service based on gender identity per se, but rather on gender presentation (they required appointments for women). The customer identifies as male-passing, which complicates things. If the shop's policy is gendered, that could be an issue under anti-discrimination laws, especially if they're denying service to someone who doesn't conform to traditional gender roles.\n\nEthically, the manager is balancing their religious beliefs with providing service. Legally, however, if the policy results in discrimination against transgender or non-binary individuals, it could be problematic. The manager's defense is that they have a policy for all women, but if the customer is male-passing and presenting as a man, the shop might have served them under normal circumstances. The conflict arises from the customer's self-identification versus the shop's policy based on gender presentation.\n\nAnother angle is that the shop has a female barber available for appointments. If the customer had booked in advance, the issue might have been resolved. But since they came in without an appointment, the manager followed the policy. However, if the policy is seen as excluding transgender individuals, that's a different matter. The manager's stance is that they can't make exceptions without violating their religious practices and employee comfort.\n\nIn conclusion, the manager might not be in the wrong if the policy is consistently applied and advertised. However, if the policy effectively denies service to transgender people who don't conform to gender norms, it could be considered discriminatory. The answer hinges on whether the policy's application here is based on gender identity or gender presentation, and whether it's a legitimate business practice under local laws.\n"
