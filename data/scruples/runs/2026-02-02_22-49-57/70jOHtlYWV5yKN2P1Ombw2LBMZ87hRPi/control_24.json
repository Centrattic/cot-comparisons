We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a manager at a barbershop that's mostly Muslim, and they have a policy that requires appointments for women because they don't train staff in women's haircuts due to religious reasons. A customer who is a male-passing woman came in without an appointment and wanted a men's cut. The staff didn't feel comfortable doing it because of the religious rules about not touching women's hair unless it's family, and the policy is in place to ensure women can be served by the contracted female barber.\n\nThe customer got upset, accused them of being transphobic, sexist, etc., and left. The manager is asking if they're at fault. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the religious beliefs of the staff. In some interpretations of Islam, there's a prohibition against non-mahram men touching women, which could extend to haircuts. So the staff's discomfort might be based on their faith. However, the customer identifies as a male-passing woman, which complicates things. If the customer presents as male, maybe the staff didn't realize they were a woman, but the policy is about appointments for women, so the customer might have thought they were allowed to get a regular haircut.\n\nThe policy is stated on their website and signage, which is good transparency. But when someone who appears male but is biologically female comes in, the staff might not have known, leading to a conflict. The manager's stance is that they need to follow the policy to protect both the employees and the service quality. However, the customer felt discriminated against. \n\nIs the manager wrong? It's a tricky situation. On one hand, the business has the right to set their policies based on their religious practices. On the other hand, refusing service based on gender might be seen as discriminatory. The key point is whether the policy is applied consistently. If the customer had booked an appointment with the female employee, there wouldn't be an issue. But in this case, the customer didn't have an appointment and the staff was uncomfortable. \n\nThe manager might not be at fault if they're following their stated policy and considering their employees' religious beliefs. However, the policy itself could be problematic if it's denying service to a transgender or non-binary person who is male-passing. The customer might not have intended to book an appointment because they didn't identify as female in the traditional sense. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the policy is enforced fairly and if there's a way to accommodate the customer without violating staff beliefs. Since the manager could have offered to contact the female employee if given notice, but the customer refused to wait, the manager's hands are tied. The employees' comfort and the policy are valid, but the customer's experience is also important. However, the business has the right to set their service boundaries based on their beliefs, within legal limits. In some places, religious exemptions might protect this practice, but in others, it could be considered discriminatory. The answer might depend on local laws, but based on the information given, the manager isn't necessarily in the wrong for adhering to the policy and respecting staff beliefs.\n"
