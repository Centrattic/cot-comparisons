We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the author of the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is a barber and manager at a Muslim-owned shop that mostly serves men. They have a policy of requiring appointments for women because they don't have female stylists trained for women's hair due to religious reasons. A customer, who is a male-passing woman, came in wanting a man's cut but was denied because of the appointment policy. She got upset and accused them of being transphobic, etc. The author is wondering if they were wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the policies and their justification. The shop states their appointment policy for women on their website, so they're upfront about it. The reason given is a combination of religious guidelines (not touching women's hair unless family) and practical reasons (different tools/products). The employees aren't trained for women's hair. So when the customer came in, they followed the policy by explaining they need an appointment. However, the customer identified as a male-passing woman, which complicates things.\n\nNow, the key points are: 1) The shop has clear policies in place, stated publicly. 2) Their policy is based on religious beliefs and practical limitations. 3) The customer was informed about the need for an appointment but was insistent. 4) The customer felt discriminated against, leading to accusations of transphobia and sexism.\n\nFrom a legal perspective, in many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity, but there's a gray area when religious exemptions are claimed. The shop's policy might be seen as discriminatory if they're denying service to someone who doesn't fit traditional gender categories. However, the shop does have a system in place to accommodate women via appointments with their female stylist, so they're not completely excluding women.\n\nReligiously, some interpretations of Islam prohibit men from touching women's hair, but if the customer is a woman who presents as male, how does that affect the rule? If she's a woman, the rule applies regardless of how she presents. However, if the business is rigidly applying the rule without considering gender identity, that could be problematic. But the shop's policy is explicit, so they might argue it's not discrimination but a policy they apply to everyone.\n\nOn the other hand, if the customer is transgender or gender non-conforming, the policy might inadvertently exclude them. The shop's reasoning for the policy is based on both religion and practical training, but the practical aspect is that they don't train for women's hair. If the customer is a woman seeking a men's cut, the policy still requires an appointment. The shop's stance is that the policy is for all women, not just trans women, so they're applying it consistently.\n\nThe customer's reaction suggests they feel the policy is sexist and transphobic. The author might be in the wrong if the policy is not accommodating gender identity. But the shop's policy is clear and they have a system to serve women. The author tried to explain the need for an appointment, but the customer didn't listen. The author could be in the right if they followed their stated policy and provided a solution (calling in the female stylist with notice). However, if the policy is inherently discriminatory regardless of the intent, then the author might be at fault.\n\nAnother angle: the shop's policy is based on religious beliefs, but in some jurisdictions, that might not be a valid exemption from anti-discrimination laws. If the law says they can't deny service based on gender identity, then the author is in the wrong. But if the law allows religious exemptions, then they're not. The answer might depend on the specific country or region, which the question doesn't specify. Assuming a US context, Title VII allows religious accommodations but also prohibits discrimination. However, there's a complex interplay here.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because they have a clear policy and a way to serve women, but there's a risk of being seen as discriminatory if the policy doesn't account for gender identity. However, since the policy applies to all women regardless of gender expression, and the shop does have a method to serve them, it's possible they're not in the wrong. The answer might be B (No), but I need to check if the reasoning holds.\n"
