We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is a barber shop manager who didn't cut a customer's hair because the customer was a male-passing woman. The shop has a policy requiring appointments for women, and they only have one female barber who's contracted. Their reasoning is religious\u2014they don't allow male barbers to cut women's hair, and they don't train in women's hair due to religion. The customer accused them of being transphobic, sexist, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, discrimination based on gender identity or expression is prohibited. If the shop's policy excludes transgender or non-binary individuals, that could be problematic. Even if the policy is based on religion, laws might still require accommodations unless there's an exemption. I should check if religious exemptions apply here, but I'm not sure. Also, the shop's policy is stated on their website, so maybe they're not at fault for not serving outside their stated services. However, if the customer identifies as male but is assigned female at birth, does the policy still apply? That's a bit tricky. If the shop categorizes based on biological sex, but the customer is presenting as male, maybe they should be treated as a male customer. But if the customer is a trans man, the shop's policy might still exclude them, which could be discriminatory.\n\nAnother angle is the shop's stated policy. They mention that appointments are required for women, which is clear. If a customer presents as male but is a trans woman, the shop might not be aware. But in this case, the customer is male-passing, so maybe the shop didn't realize they were a woman. However, the customer claims they are a woman, so the shop's policy would apply. But if the shop is using a strict religious rule, they might not be able to accommodate even if the customer says they're a woman. But this could lead to discrimination against trans women.\n\nAlso, the shop mentions that they serve all sorts of customers, so maybe their policy is more about gender presentation than actual identity. But if they can't serve anyone who is a woman or presents as a woman, that's an issue. The customer might feel that the policy is excluding them based on gender identity, which is a protected class in many areas. The shop's reasoning that they don't train in women's hair might be a business practice, but if it's enforced strictly, it could be seen as discrimination.\n\nThe user is Muslim, so I should consider Islamic teachings. In some interpretations, men are not allowed to touch women's hair for grooming, but if the customer is a trans man, does that change things? There's a lot of nuance here, and the shop's interpretation might not account for transgender individuals. The shop might not be aware that their policy could be excluding trans people. However, if their policy is based on religious beliefs, they might not be able to adjust it without violating their faith.\n\nBalancing religious freedom against anti-discrimination laws is a tough spot. In some places, religious exemptions might allow businesses to not provide services that go against their beliefs, but if the customer is part of a protected group, the law might side with the customer. The shop's policy might be legal if it's for all women, but if a trans man is presenting as male, the shop might be allowed to serve him under their male policy. However, if the customer is a trans woman presenting as female, the shop's policy would apply, but that could be seen as discrimination.\n\nIn conclusion, the shop's policy is clear, but it might inadvertently or intentionally exclude trans individuals. If the law protects against gender identity discrimination, then the shop could be in the wrong. However, if their religious beliefs are protected, there's a conflict. The answer might depend on local laws, which I don't have specifics on. Given the information, the user might not be in the wrong if their policy is clearly stated and they follow it as written, but the accusations could still hold if the policy is discriminatory. So, the answer could be B (not in the wrong), but with the caveat that it's a complex situation.\n"
