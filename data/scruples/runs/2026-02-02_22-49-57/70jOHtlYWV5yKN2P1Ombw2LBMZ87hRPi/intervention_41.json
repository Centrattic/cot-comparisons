We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me read through the details carefully.\n\nThe author is a barber and manager of a shop that's mostly Muslim. They have a policy where women need appointments because they have a contracted female stylist. The shop's signage, social media, and website all mention this. The customer in question is a male-passing woman who wanted a man's haircut without an appointment. The shop's policy is that male barbers can't cut women's hair due to religious reasons, and since the customer identified as a woman, the staff was uncomfortable. The customer got upset, called them transphobic, sexist, etc., and left. The author is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the policies they have in place. They clearly state on their platforms that women need appointments. That's a transparent policy. The customer might be unaware of that, but the shop is upfront about it. However, the customer here is a male-passing woman, which complicates things. She might have identified as male or non-binary, expecting to be served like any other male customer. The shop's policy is based on the gender of the customer, not their gender identity, which could be a point of contention.\n\nReligious reasons are cited for not allowing male barbers to cut women's hair. That's a valid reason for the shop, but it might conflict with anti-discrimination laws depending on the location. However, the shop does provide a way for women to get haircuts by having the female stylist, so they aren't entirely excluding women. The issue here is whether the customer's gender identity affects the policy. If the shop's policy is based on the sex of the customer (as per their religious beliefs), then the customer who is a woman (sex) would still need an appointment, regardless of how they present. But if the customer identifies as male or non-binary, the shop might be excluding someone based on gender identity, which could be seen as transphobic.\n\nThe shop is also transparent about their policy, so the customer might have been informed beforehand. However, the customer's situation is a bit of a grey area. They might not have realized they needed an appointment because of how they present. The author argues that the appointment system is in place for the staff's comfort and service quality, not just the customer. The staff's religious beliefs are a factor here, which is a protected class in some places, but so is gender identity and expression.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical considerations, the shop is within their rights to have policies based on their religious beliefs, provided they don't violate anti-discrimination laws. If the shop is in a place where religious exemptions are allowed, they might be okay. However, if the policy is seen as discriminatory against transgender or non-binary individuals, that's a different issue. The author might not be in the wrong if the policy is clearly communicated and the shop provides an alternative (the female stylist), but the way the situation was handled could still be problematic in terms of perceived transphobia.\n\nThe key points are: clear policy stated publicly, the shop provides an alternative, but the customer felt discriminated against. The author might be in the right by following their policy, but there's a valid criticism about how the policy affects gender identity. However, the shop's religious beliefs are also a factor. It's a complex case where both sides have valid points. The answer might depend on cultural context and local laws. If the shop's policy is based on the customer's sex (biological) and not gender identity, then they might not be violating anti-discrimination laws. But if the customer's gender identity is male or non-binary, the shop could be seen as excluding them based on identity, which is different from their sex.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because the policy is in place and communicated, and they have a way to serve women. However, the customer's experience might highlight a gap in how the policy is applied to non-binary or transgender individuals. But since the shop is transparent, maybe they aren't at fault. So I'd lean towards B (Not in the wrong).\n"
