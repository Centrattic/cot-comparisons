We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a Muslim barbershop that primarily serves men and has a policy where women need appointments because the staff isn't trained in women's haircuts due to religious reasons. A non-binary customer who male-passes was turned away because they didn't have an appointment and couldn't get a male barber to do their hair. The staff felt uncomfortable, and the customer accused them of being transphobic, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity or expression. Even if the policy is for women, if the customer is a trans man or non-binary person, they might be seen as a man for the service. The policy could be considered discriminatory if it denies service based on gender identity without a legitimate business reason.\n\nThen there's the religious accommodation angle. The staff cites religious beliefs as the reason, but laws often require businesses to serve everyone regardless of their religion. The shop might be allowed to have some religious practices, but if that leads to discrimination against protected classes like gender identity, they could be violating anti-discrimination laws.\n\nThe customer's perspective is important too. They were turned away despite presenting as male and wanting a men's cut. If the staff's policy is based on gender, it might not account for non-binary or trans individuals. The customer might feel their identity isn't respected, leading to the accusations of transphobia.\n\nThe shop's policy is also about employee comfort. But requiring employees to provide services they're uncomfortable with due to religious reasons might not hold up legally if it leads to denial of service to customers. There's a balance between employee rights and customer rights here.\n\nLooking at the shop's practices, they do have a female barber available on appointment. However, the customer wasn't given the option to book that appointment, even if they could wait. The shop could argue they need time to contract the female barber, but the customer might see that as an unnecessary barrier.\n\nIn terms of the author's responsibility, as a manager, they are responsible for the business's policies and how they're applied. Even if the policy is in place for religious reasons, if it's excluding certain individuals from services, it could be considered discriminatory. The shop might need to adjust their policy to accommodate diverse gender identities without compromising their religious beliefs, perhaps by not relying on gender for scheduling but instead on the stylist's training regardless of the customer's gender.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because the policy, while based on religious beliefs, likely discriminates against transgender and non-binary individuals and may not comply with anti-discrimination laws. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
