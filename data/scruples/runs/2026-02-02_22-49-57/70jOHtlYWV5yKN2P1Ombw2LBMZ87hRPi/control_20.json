We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (a barber and manager) is in the wrong for not cutting a customer's hair. The situation involves a male-passing trans woman who wanted a men's style haircut. The shop has a policy that requires appointments for women because they only have one female barber available on a contract basis. The staff, due to religious reasons, are not trained or comfortable cutting women's hair. The customer got upset and accused the shop of being transphobic and sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity or sex. However, the shop's policy is to require appointments for women to ensure their needs are met with the available female barber. The issue here is whether the customer identifies as a woman under the shop's policy. If the customer is a trans woman, then the shop's policy might be seen as discriminatory against her. The shop's sign and online info mention the appointment requirement for women, but does that apply to trans women? That's unclear, but if the policy is based on gender, then it could be problematic regardless of the reason.\n\nThe shop's religious beliefs are mentioned as a reason for not allowing male staff to cut women's hair. However, religious exemptions don't always override anti-discrimination laws, especially if the customer is part of a protected class. The key here is whether the shop is providing equal service to all customers regardless of gender identity. By not allowing this trans woman to be served by a male barber, even if the policy is to route women to the female barber, it could be seen as denying service based on gender identity, which is discrimination.\n\nAnother angle is the customer's perspective. If they present as male and want a men's cut, the shop's policy might be applied inconsistently. The shop has to determine how they categorize customers (based on appearance, gender identity, or assigned sex at birth). If they rely on appearance, the trans woman might be misgendered, leading to confusion. But if they ask for the customer's identity, the shop's policy could conflict with the customer's self-identification.\n\nThe shop's justification is about employee comfort and training, but that could be considered a business practice that indirectly discriminates. They should have a system in place to handle such cases without making the customer feel excluded. The fact that they need a couple of hours' notice to call a female barber suggests a potential solution, which the customer refused to wait for. However, the refusal to serve based on gender identity, even with a policy in place, might still be discriminatory.\n\nIn summary, the shop's policy, while based on religious and training reasons, may not account for the customer's gender identity, leading to a situation where they are denied service. This could be seen as discriminatory, making the author at fault. The answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
