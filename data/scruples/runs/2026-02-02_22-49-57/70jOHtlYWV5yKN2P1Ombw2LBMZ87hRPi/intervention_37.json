We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is a barber and manager of a shop that's mostly Muslim, with a policy where women need appointments so the contracted female stylist can handle them. They had a customer who is a male-passing woman who wanted a men's cut. The staff didn't feel comfortable cutting her hair due to religious reasons and the lack of training in women's hair. The customer left upset, accusing them of being transphobic, etc. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the religious aspect. The staff's reluctance is based on their faith, which in some interpretations prohibits men from touching women's hair unless it's family. That's a key point. However, the customer identifies as a woman who presents as male, so this might complicate things. If the religious belief doesn't extend to non-binary or transgender individuals, perhaps the policy is outdated. But given the way the author states the rule, it's about gender regardless of identity.\n\nNext, the policy is clearly stated on all platforms, so the customer should have been aware. The author tried to explain that the system is for the staff's comfort and service quality. The customer didn't want to wait for the female stylist, which led to the conflict. \n\nFrom a business ethics perspective, the shop has a right to set their policies, especially if it's based on the employees' religious beliefs. However, there's a potential issue with discrimination. If the policy is based on gender rather than gender identity, it might not align with current anti-discrimination laws, which often protect gender identity. But in some places, religious exemptions might allow for such policies. \n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer depends on the context of the law and the ethical standpoint. If the policy is based on the employees' religious beliefs and the business is transparent about it, some might say the author isn't in the wrong. Others might argue that refusing service to a transgender woman is discriminatory, especially if the customer's identity doesn't align with the gender policy. \n\nBut the key points here are the clear policy and the staff's discomfort. The author tried to accommodate by having the female stylist, but the customer wasn't willing to wait. Also, the author states they're not trained in women's hair, which affects service quality. So legally, it's a gray area, but ethically, the author might not be in the wrong if the policy is clearly communicated and they offer an alternative (the appointment with the female stylist). The customer's accusation of transphobia might be based on misunderstanding the policy's intent. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong, given the policy is clear, the alternative is offered, and the reasons are based on both religious beliefs and service standards.\n"
