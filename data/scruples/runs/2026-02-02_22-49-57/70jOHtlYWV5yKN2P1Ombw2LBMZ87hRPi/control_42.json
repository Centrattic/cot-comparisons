We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a barber shop manager who didn't cut a customer's hair because the customer was a male-passing woman, and they don't cut women's hair due to religious policies. The question is whether the author is at fault here.\n\nFirst, the store has a policy stated publicly that they require appointments for women, which are handled by their contracted female stylist. The customer was a male-passing woman who wanted a men's cut. The staff felt uncomfortable because of the religious rule about not cutting women's hair unless it's family. But the customer identified as male-passing, so maybe they expected to be treated as a man.\n\nThe manager's reasoning is that they can't cut women's hair due to religious beliefs and that their policy is in place to ensure women can be served. However, the customer was upset and accused the shop of being transphobic and sexist. The key points here are the public policy, the customer's gender identity, and the religious exemption.\n\nIn terms of legal aspects, businesses can have religious exemptions, but in many places, discrimination based on gender identity is prohibited. If the customer identifies as male, even if they are a woman, the shop's policy might not cover that. The shop's policy is for women, but if the customer is perceived as male, maybe the policy doesn't apply. However, the shop's policy is based on the customer's gender as per their records, not the customer's self-identification.\n\nAlso, the shop's policy is to serve women via appointments with the female stylist. If the customer is a male-passing woman, they might not consider themselves a woman and thus expect the same service as a male customer. The shop's refusal could be seen as not accommodating their gender identity, leading to discrimination claims.\n\nThe employee's religious beliefs might be a factor, but in many jurisdictions, businesses can't cite employees' religious beliefs to deny service based on the customer's gender identity. The shop might be violating anti-discrimination laws by not providing service based on a customer's gender identity, even if their policy is stated publicly.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's decision not to cut the hair based on the customer's gender (as they are a male-passing woman) could be seen as discriminatory. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they failed to consider the customer's gender identity and the potential legal implications regarding discrimination.\n"
