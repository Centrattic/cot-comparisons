We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves a barber who didn't cut a male-passing woman's hair because they require appointments for women and none of the staff were comfortable doing so for religious reasons.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The barbershop has a policy that they state publicly about requiring appointments for women. They have a female stylist who works on a contract basis. The customer, who is a trans man or gender non-conforming person, wanted a men's cut but wasn't willing to book an appointment or wait for the female stylist. The barbership's policy is based on religious beliefs, where male barbers aren't allowed to cut women's hair unless it's family. The customer felt this was transphobic or sexist.\n\nNow, thinking about legality and discrimination. In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity, especially if the customer is perceived as male. If the customer is male-passing and wants a standard men's haircut, the policy that requires appointments for women might not apply here. The barbershop's policy is based on the assumption that anyone not a woman (as per their criteria) can be cut by male staff, but if the customer is gender non-conforming, that policy might be excluding them without valid reason.\n\nAlso, the policy of requiring appointments for women because of religious reasons might not extend to trans or non-binary customers who present as men. The business's policy could be seen as not accommodating the customer's identity because they don't recognize male-passing individuals as valid for the male service without an appointment. This could be a conflict between the business's religious practices and the customer's gender identity.\n\nFrom a discrimination perspective, if the business is refusing service based on gender identity, even if it's unintentional, it might be problematic. The customer's complaint about being transphobic or sexist could stem from feeling that their gender identity isn't respected. The business's stance could lead to legal issues if they're not providing equal service to all genders, including those who don't fit traditional female presentations.\n\nHowever, the business is also protecting their employees' religious beliefs. But in many jurisdictions, religious exemptions don't allow businesses to discriminate against customers. The employees' comfort based on religious beliefs might not override the customer's rights. The business might need to find a solution that respects both, like allowing the customer to be cut by male staff if they identify as male, while still having the appointment policy for cisgender women.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's refusal based on the appointment policy might be seen as discriminatory towards the customer's gender identity, thus making them in the wrong. So the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
