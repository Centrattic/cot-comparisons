We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a barber and manager in a shop that primarily serves men. They have a policy where women need appointments because they have a contracted female barber. The situation involves a customer who is a male-passing woman wanting a man's haircut. The shop's policy and religious beliefs prevent male barbers from cutting women's hair unless it's family, which isn't the case here. The customer felt discriminated against and left upset.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the shop's policy, religious reasons, and the customer's identity. The shop clearly states on their website and signs that appointments are required for women, so they're upfront about it. The religious aspect is important here, as the staff's beliefs prevent them from cutting women's hair. The customer, however, identifies as a male-passing woman and wanted a men's cut, which complicates the situation because the shop might not see them as a woman based on appearance but still has a policy in place.\n\nThe user argues that they need the appointment system for women because of the different needs in hair texture and products, and that the staff isn't trained for women's hair. They also mention that the female barber is contracted separately. The customer ended up feeling transphobic and sexist, leading to a conflict.\n\nNow, considering legal and ethical angles. In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity or expression. Even if the shop has a religious exemption, it's a gray area. The customer is in a protected category, so the shop might be violating anti-discrimination laws. However, the shop's policy is clear, and they have a contracted female barber. The challenge here is whether the customer's identity as a gender non-conforming person falls under the same protections as women, and if the shop's policy inadvertently excludes them.\n\nThe shop's policy might be seen as excluding trans or non-binary individuals who don't conform to traditional gender presentations. Even if the policy is for women, if the customer is perceived as male but identifies as a woman, the shop might not be following their own policy correctly. Alternatively, if the shop strictly follows the policy as written (appointments for women), and the customer is mistaken about their eligibility, the shop isn't at fault. However, if the policy doesn't account for gender diversity, the shop could be seen as discriminatory.\n\nAnother angle is the intent behind the policy. The shop's policy is to serve women through a female barber due to religious reasons. If the customer is a woman who presents as male, the policy should still apply. But if the customer is a trans man or non-binary, the policy might not cover them, leading to confusion. The shop might not have considered how their policy affects gender-diverse individuals, which could be an oversight.\n\nIn terms of religious exemptions, some places allow businesses to follow religious beliefs in their services, but this is often tested in courts. The shop's religious beliefs are a factor here, but they must balance that against anti-discrimination laws. The key issue is whether the customer's presence disrupts the shop's religious practices. If the shop can't serve them without violating their beliefs, the policy might be justified. However, if the shop can make an exception or adjust their policy to accommodate without violating their beliefs, they might be at fault.\n\nThe user's answer options are A (at fault) or B (not at fault). Given the complexities, it's a tough call. The shop's policy is clear, and they have a contracted barber for women. However, the policy might not adequately address the needs of gender-diverse customers. The customer might feel excluded or discriminated against because the policy doesn't account for their identity. The shop's religious reasons are valid, but they could be seen as not accommodating gender diversity properly. Therefore, the shop might be at fault for not considering the intersection of their policy with gender identity laws.\n"
