We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not cutting a customer's hair. The situation involves a barber shop with a policy that requires appointments for women, and they have a woman barber who's on a contract basis. The customer in question is a male-passing woman who wanted a men's cut but the staff couldn't serve her because of religious rules.\n\nFirst, the shop's policy is clear: they require appointments for women. They state this on their website, Facebook, etc. So they're upfront. The customer might not have been aware, but the information is publicly available. That seems like a valid policy. \n\nThen there's the religious aspect. The employees are Muslim, and they don't cut women's hair unless it's family. The woman barber is contracted for women. The staff isn't trained in women's hair due to this belief. The customer was a male-passing woman, which complicates things. The customer wanted a men's style, but the staff wasn't comfortable because the rules are about gender, not the style of the cut. \n\nThe author argues that they need to follow the policy for their employees' comfort and safety. They mention that the customer was trans and called them transphobic, but the author thinks they're not in the wrong. \n\nI need to consider if the policy is discriminatory. The shop is choosing to serve women only through a specific contracted barber, which might be legally okay if they're providing the same service but through a different method. However, if the policy is based on gender and the customer is a woman (even if presenting as male), the shop is not serving them, which could be seen as discriminatory. \n\nBut the shop is transparent about their policy. If the customer didn't check the website, maybe it's their fault. However, the customer might not be aware of the policy when arriving. Also, the religious exemption could be a factor. In some places, businesses can have religious policies, but there's a line when it comes to protected classes like gender identity. \n\nThe customer being trans adds another layer. If the shop refused based on gender identity, that could be discrimination. But the policy is about biological sex, not gender identity. However, the customer identifies as a woman but presents as male. The shop might not have had a clear policy on transgender customers, leading to the confusion. \n\nThe author did offer to get the contracted female barber, but the customer needed a few hours notice and they refused. That seems reasonable. The author tried to accommodate but the customer wasn't listening. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the policy is based on biological sex and is applied consistently, and they provide a way to access the service (through appointments with the contracted barber), then maybe they're not in the wrong. However, if they're denying service to trans women, that could be seen as discrimination. But the customer in question is a male-passing woman, so maybe the shop was following their policy correctly. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they have a policy they communicate, and they tried to offer an alternative. But the situation is complex with religious exemptions and potential discrimination. However, since the customer didn't book an appointment, and the shop is clear on their policy, the author might be justified. So the answer is B.\n"
