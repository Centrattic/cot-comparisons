We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the barber is in the wrong for not cutting a customer's hair. The customer is a male-passing woman who didn't have an appointment. The barbershop has a policy requiring appointments for women, due to religious beliefs\u2014specifically, the staff isn't trained in women's haircuts and the religious prohibition against male barbers cutting women's hair. \n\nFirst, the barbershop is clear about their policies on their website and signs. They mention needing appointments for women. The customer might not have checked those details, but the barbershop has made their policy public. That's a point in their favor.\n\nThe customer argues that they want a men's style, so maybe they expect a male barber. But the barbershop's issue is that they don't train in women's hair, regardless of the desired style. Also, their religious beliefs contribute to the policy. They have a female barber available for appointments, but that day, she wasn't present. The customer didn't give enough notice to call her in. The barbershop had to prioritize their employees' comfort and the service quality, which is understandable.\n\nThe customer accused them of transphobia and sexism, but the policy is about gender, not gender identity. The customer is a male-passing woman, so maybe there's a confusion here. The barbershop's policy is based on the customer's assigned gender at birth or biological sex, not their gender identity. That could be a point of contention. However, the barbershop is consistent in their policy, applying it to all women, regardless of how they present. \n\nThe key factors are transparency of policy, the staff's training and religious beliefs, and the availability of an alternative (the female barber). Since the barbershop can't provide the service without the female barber that day and the customer didn't book an appointment, they aren't at fault for not being able to help. They also expressed feeling bad, showing they care about the customer's experience but had to balance it with their employees' needs and religious practices.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
