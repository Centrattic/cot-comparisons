We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a barber shop manager who's Muslim, and they have a policy that women need appointments because only the contracted female barber can cut their hair. The situation involved a male-passing woman who wanted a men's cut. The shop's policy requires appointments for women, which is stated on their website and signs. The customer felt they were transphobic, etc., and left in a huff.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect. In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity. But the shop's policy might be based on religious beliefs. However, anti-discrimination laws often take precedence. So even if the policy is rooted in religion, if it's excluding someone based on gender identity, there might be a legal issue. \n\nThen there's the ethical angle. The customer identified as male-passing, so maybe they felt the policy was unfair since they're gendering as male. The shop's employees aren't trained in women's haircuts due to religious reasons, which could be a valid business reason. But if the customer is perceived as male, maybe they should have been accommodated differently. \n\nThe shop's policy is clear about appointments for women, but the customer didn't identify as female. There's a conflict here between the policy and the customer's gender presentation. The shop might not have been aware that the customer wasn't a woman, so their policy might not have applied. However, the shop's policy is based on the customer's gender, which could be problematic if it leads to discrimination against transgender individuals.\n\nAlso, the shop mentions they're not trained in women's haircuts. If the customer is presenting as male, perhaps there's a misunderstanding. The staff might not be equipped to handle men's cuts, but the customer wanted a men's style. Maybe the shop could have made an exception or adjusted their policy in this case.\n\nThe user's stance is that they're not in the wrong, emphasizing their employees' comfort and the policy's necessity. But the customer felt targeted. There's also the aspect of religious accommodation vs. anti-discrimination laws. Depending on the jurisdiction, the shop might be violating anti-discrimination laws, even if their policy is religiously motivated.\n\nIn some places, religious exemptions allow businesses to make exceptions, but when it comes to protected classes like gender identity, those exemptions might not apply. So the shop could be legally in the wrong. Ethically, excluding someone based on their gender identity could be seen as discriminatory, regardless of the reason.\n\nThe key points are: the policy is based on gender, the customer's gender presentation complicates the policy, legal standards may require serving all customers regardless of gender identity, and the shop's refusal might be considered discrimination.\n"
