We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the barber who refused to cut a male-passing woman's hair is in the wrong. The situation involves religious policies and business practices. \n\nFirst, the barbershop has a policy stating they don't cut women's hair unless there's an appointment for their contracted female stylist. The customer identified as a male-passing woman but wanted a men's cut. The manager explained that the policy is in place because of religious guidelines\u2014specifically, male employees aren't allowed to touch women's hair, and they don't train in women's hair. They tried to explain the need for an appointment but the customer got upset and left, accusing them of being transphobic, sexist, etc.\n\nNow, considering the business's stated policies on their website, social media, etc., they made it clear who they serve. The customer might not have checked those policies, so the shop isn't hiding the information. The manager also mentions that the policy isn't about the customer's gender per se but about the employees' religious beliefs and the training they have. The customer's response was emotional, but the shop tried to explain their reasoning and offered a solution (appointment). \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, businesses can have policies based on religion as long as they don't discriminate against protected classes. However, in some places, refusing service based on gender identity could be an issue. But here, the shop isn't refusing based on gender identity; they have a policy for women (regardless of gender identity) and have a process for that. The customer might be conflating the policy with being transphobic, but the shop's stance is about the employees' religious beliefs and training, not the customer's identity.\n\nThe manager did feel bad but stood by the policy to protect employees and ensure service quality. The answer hinges on whether the policy is legitimate and properly communicated. If the policy is clear and consistently applied, the shop isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, if the policy is being used as a pretext for discrimination (e.g., targeting transgender individuals), that's a different scenario. In this case, the manager is applying the policy as stated, and the female stylist is available by appointment, so the service isn't entirely denied but requires advance notice. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong) because the policies were in place, communicated, and there's a valid reason (religion and training) behind them. The shop provided an alternative solution, which shows they're not refusing service entirely but have operational constraints.\n"
