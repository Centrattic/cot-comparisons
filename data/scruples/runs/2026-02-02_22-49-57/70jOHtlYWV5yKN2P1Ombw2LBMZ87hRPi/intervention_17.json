We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is a barber shop run by Muslims where they have a policy that women need appointments, and they have a female barber they contract for that. The customer was a male-passing woman who wanted a man's cut, but the shop couldn't accommodate because of their policy and the religious rules about not cutting women's hair unless it's family.\n\nFirst, the shop clearly states their policy on their website and signs. That's important because they're being transparent. The customer might not have checked, but the policy is out there. The shop's reasoning is both religious and practical\u2014they don't train on women's hair, and their female barber isn't available on short notice. The employees aren't comfortable cutting women's hair, which relates to their beliefs.\n\nNow, the customer got upset, called them transphobic, etc. But the author argues that they're following their stated policies and respecting their employees' religious beliefs. The key points here are transparency and the religious exemptions. In many places, businesses can have religious objections that affect services, as long as they don't discriminate based on protected classes. However, if the customer identifies as male but presents as female, maybe there's a different angle here. But the shop's policy is about gender, not gender identity. So if the customer is a woman (gender-wise) passing as male, the shop's policy applies because they need an appointment for women. But if the customer's gender identity is male, maybe there's a conflict here between the policy and the customer's identity.\n\nBut the shop's policy is based on gender as presented, not gender identity. They might not have considered that, which could be a point against them. However, they are following their own stated rules and their employees' religious convictions. The author also mentions that they tried to explain that the appointment system is for women, which is why they can't just accommodate. The customer didn't accept that.\n\nLegally, in some places, businesses can have religious exemptions, but in others, they can't refuse service based on gender identity. This is a gray area. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong morally or ethically, not just legally. The author seems to be standing by their policy and the employees' comfort. The customer might feel wronged because they were denied service, but the shop had their policy in place. The author might be seen as not accommodating a trans person, which could be a problem. But if the customer is a cis woman passing as male, then the policy applies. The situation is complicated by the intersection of religious freedom and anti-discrimination laws.\n\nIn the end, the author might not be in the wrong if they followed their policy and made it clear. But if the customer is part of a protected class (like LGBTQ+), then the shop could be seen as discriminatory. However, the shop's stance is based on religious beliefs and the employees' comfort. It's a tough call. But since the user thinks the author isn't wrong, and considering the shop's transparency and policy, I might lean towards B. But I'm not 100% sure because the transphobic accusation is serious. However, the shop's policy isn't necessarily about gender identity but about biological sex as presented. If the customer is a trans man, then the policy might be problematic. But the shop might not have the resources to accommodate that. This is a complex issue with no clear answer, but based on the info given, the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
