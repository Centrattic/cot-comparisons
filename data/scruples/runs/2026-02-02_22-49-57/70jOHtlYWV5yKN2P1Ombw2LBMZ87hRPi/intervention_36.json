We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation involves a barber who is a manager at a shop that primarily serves men and has a policy of requiring appointments for women. The customer in question is a male-passing woman who wanted a men's haircut but didn't have an appointment. The shop's policy is set up because they don't have a woman barber on staff during that time, and their religious beliefs prevent male staff from cutting women's hair. The customer felt discriminated against and called the shop transphobic, sexist, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity or gender expression. The customer is a woman who identifies as such but presents in a way that might be mistaken for male. The shop's policy is based on religion, but they also have a contract with a female barber for appointments. The problem is whether the policy is a legitimate business rule or a form of discrimination.\n\nThe shop's argument is that they can't serve women without the female barber because of religious beliefs and lack of training. However, the customer is a woman who wanted a men's cut, which the male barbers could do, but the shop's policy prevents that. The conflict is between the shop's policy and the customer's right to service without discrimination.\n\nI should check if there are laws that require businesses to accommodate all customers regardless of gender identity. In the US, for example, the Civil Rights Act prohibits discrimination in public accommodations, and some states have broader protections. If the shop is refusing service based on the customer's gender identity, that could be illegal even if the refusal is due to religious views. The shop's policy might not be a valid defense if it's indirectly discriminatory. \n\nThe shop's sign and website stating that they require appointments for women might be seen as a legitimate policy, but when a customer doesn't fit neatly into the categories (like a male-passing woman), the policy could lead to discrimination. The customer might not know they need an appointment if they present as male. The shop's requirement could be seen as a blanket rule that doesn't account for individual circumstances, leading to unfair treatment.\n\nAdditionally, the religious exemption argument is tricky. While religious beliefs are protected, they don't always override anti-discrimination laws. The Supreme Court has ruled in some cases that religious objections don't exempt businesses from following basic anti-discrimination laws. So the shop's refusal might not hold up legally.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the shop is prioritizing their employees' comfort and religious practices, but that could be seen as justifying discrimination. The customer was denied service not because of their behavior or the service requested, but due to their gender identity. The shop might be in the wrong if their policy, while well-intentioned, leads to discriminatory outcomes.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong because the policy, based on religious beliefs and staff comfort, could be considered discriminatory against transgender or gender-nonconforming individuals. The shop's policy might not be a valid excuse under the law, and denying service in this case could be seen as transphobic or sexist, even if that's not the intention."
