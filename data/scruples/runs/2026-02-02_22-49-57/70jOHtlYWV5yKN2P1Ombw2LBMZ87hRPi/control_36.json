We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the barber shop manager) is in the wrong. The situation is that a customer, who is a male-passing woman, came in without an appointment and wanted a haircut. The shop's policy requires appointments for women because they only have one female stylist who's contracted. The staff, being Muslim, have a religious rule about not cutting women's hair unless it's family, which the customer wasn't. The customer got upset, called them transphobic, and left in a huff.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The shop's policy is clear: appointments are required for women, which is stated on their website, Facebook, etc. The customer identified as a male-passing woman but wanted a men's haircut. The staff isn't trained in women's haircuts due to religious reasons. The manager tried to explain that they needed a few hours notice to bring in the female stylist but the customer was angry and didn't listen.\n\nNow, the question is whether the manager is in the wrong. On one hand, the shop has a policy that's publicly stated, and they can't accommodate women without an appointment because of their staff's religious beliefs. They also mention that they serve all sorts of customers, but their staff's comfort and training are based on religion. On the other hand, the customer was a woman who might not have been aware of the appointment policy, especially since she presents as male. Also, there's a potential issue here regarding transphobia. If she is transgender and wants a men's haircut, the shop's policy might be excluding her based on her gender identity, which could be seen as discriminatory.\n\nBut the policy isn't about gender per se; it's about how the staff is trained and their religious beliefs regarding touching women's hair. The shop is clear about their policy, so maybe they aren't at fault for not making an exception. However, if the customer is a woman, regardless of how she presents, the policy should apply. The problem here is whether the shop is allowed to enforce such a policy without considering gender identity. Also, the shop is using religion as a defense, but in many places, religious exemptions don't override anti-discrimination laws, especially in public accommodations.\n\nAnother angle: the shop requires appointments for women, which is their business practice. The customer didn't have an appointment. The manager tried to explain that they need notice to bring in the female stylist but the customer was unwilling to wait. However, the customer's anger led to accusations of transphobia and sexism. The manager might not be in the wrong because they followed their policy, but the way they handled it might have been problematic. If the policy is clear, then the customer should be informed upfront and not expect service without an appointment. However, if the policy is based on religious beliefs that exclude certain customers, it could be seen as discriminatory, especially in a secular society.\n\nAlso, the staff's refusal to cut women's hair due to religion is a business practice that might conflict with equality laws. In many countries, businesses can't discriminate based on gender or religion. The shop's policy might be violating such laws. Therefore, even though they have a stated policy, they might still be in the wrong because they are not providing equal service to women, regardless of their staff's beliefs.\n\nSo putting it all together: the manager followed the shop's policy, which is publicly stated, but the policy itself may be discriminatory. The manager might not be at fault for enforcing the policy, but the policy itself is problematic. However, the question is about the manager's personal wrongness, not the policy. If the policy is against the law, then the manager is also in the wrong. If the policy is legal, then the manager isn't. But in most places, such a policy would be considered discriminatory. Also, the customer's gender identity adds another layer\u2014transgender individuals may have different considerations. If the shop's policy excludes transgender women from service, that could be seen as transphobic, regardless of the reason.\n\nTherefore, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because the policy is discriminatory and the manager's enforcement of it, even with stated reasons, does not excuse the outcome of refusing service based on gender identity.\n"
