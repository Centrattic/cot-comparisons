We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author of this AITA post is in the wrong. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The person is a manager at a barbershop that mainly serves men, with a woman barber who's contracted for women's appointments. The shop's policy is to require appointments for women, and they mention this on all their platforms. The customer in question is a male-passing woman who wanted a men's haircut. The manager refused because they don't have a female barber available on the day, and the employees are uncomfortable cutting her hair due to religious reasons. The customer accused them of being transphobic and sexist, and left in a huff.\n\nFirst, I should consider the policy itself. The shop explicitly states that they require appointments for women, which is a clear policy. The customer might have seen that and expected the same, but since they're male-passing and wanted a men's cut, they probably assumed they'd be treated like a regular male customer. The manager's reasoning is that the policy is in place to ensure proper service, considering that women's hair may require different techniques and products, and that the barbers aren't trained for that. Also, the religious aspect comes into play because the employees are Muslim and there's a rule about not touching women's hair unless it's family. \n\nNow, the main issue here is whether the manager is wrong to enforce the policy. The customer is a woman, even if she's male-passing, so the policy applies. The shop has a system where they can't serve women without the contracted stylist, which is why they require appointments. The manager tried to explain that they needed a couple of hours' notice to call in the female employee. However, the customer didn't accept this and left angry, accusing the shop of discrimination.\n\nFrom a business perspective, the shop has the right to set their own policies. If they don't have the capacity to serve women without prior notice, it's reasonable to require appointments. The fact that they mention this on their website and in their signage means they're being transparent. The manager isn't denying the customer a haircut based on their gender in a way that's hidden; they just don't have the staff trained for women's hair on that day. \n\nReligious beliefs can sometimes be a factor in business policies. However, businesses can't discriminate based on gender or gender identity in some places. But since the policy is clearly communicated beforehand, the shop isn't necessarily violating any laws. They're providing a service only when they can, and the customer didn't follow the policy. However, the customer's gender identity might complicate things. If they identify as a woman but present as male, does the policy still apply? The shop's policy is about the need for a trained stylist for women's hair, which is a business decision, not a gender identity issue. The problem here is that they can't accommodate the customer without the stylist, regardless of how the customer presents. \n\nThe manager also mentions that the employees are uncomfortable due to both religious reasons and the training aspect. That seems like a legitimate business concern. They can't force employees to perform procedures they're uncomfortable with, especially if it's against their beliefs or training. So the shop is trying to balance employee comfort and the quality of service. \n\nBut then, the accusations of being transphobic and sexist. The customer might feel that because they're a woman who passes as male, they shouldn't have to follow the appointment policy. The shop's stance is that the policy is for all women, not specifically targeting transgender individuals. The manager tried to explain, but the customer didn't listen. \n\nI need to think about whether the policy is discriminatory. If the reason is that they don't have female barbers available due to religious beliefs, but they do have a contracted one, maybe they're not refusing to serve women in general, just when they can't get the appropriate stylist. However, the policy is in place, which is supposed to cover that. The customer might not have known that the female barber is only available on certain days, or maybe the policy is unclear. \n\nAlso, the religious aspect\u2014some Muslim practices might prohibit men from touching women's hair, which is why they need a female barber. The employees' comfort is part of that. But is this a case of the business accommodating their beliefs at the expense of the customer's rights? If the policy is clearly stated, then the customer is entering the shop knowing the policy. But if the policy is a way to avoid serving women in general, even if they are male-passing, that could be seen as discriminatory. \n\nHowever, the business does have a contracted female barber, so maybe they can't serve women without prior arrangements. The manager's request for a couple of hours' notice seems reasonable to contact the contracted stylist. The customer not accepting that might be their own issue, but if they're in a place where businesses can't have gender-based policies, then the shop might be in trouble. \n\nIn some regions, businesses can't refuse service based on gender identity or sex, even if they have a policy. So if the customer is a woman (regardless of passing as male) and the shop is refusing her haircut without the woman stylist, even if she's asking for a men's cut, that could be a problem. The texture and tools argument might not hold up if the customer is asking for a simple men's cut, which doesn't require different products. The main issue is the religious discomfort, not the technical aspects. \n\nSo, if the shop is using the appointment policy as a way to avoid serving women due to religious reasons, even when they could potentially offer the service with the contracted stylist, that might be discriminatory. The manager's response of needing notice to call the stylist could be valid, but if the customer didn't book an appointment and the shop is unable to serve them without the stylist, then they can't just give a service they're not prepared to provide. \n\nBut the customer's gender might not be the issue here. If the shop's policy is to require appointments for women, and the customer is a woman, then the manager is following the policy. The customer's reaction might be more about not wanting to follow the appointment system, perhaps because they assumed they could get a quick cut like any man. \n\nHowever, the religious aspect complicates things. The employees' beliefs are being protected, but does that override the customer's right to service? If the business is in a place where gender identity is protected, and the customer is trans, maybe the shop is being transphobic by not accommodating them. But the author says the customer is a male-passing woman. If the customer is a cisgender woman, then it's about gender-based service denial. \n\nIn conclusion, the shop is being transparent about their policy, but if their policy is based on religious reasons that prevent male employees from cutting women's hair, even when the customer wants a men's style, that could be seen as discriminatory towards women. The author might not be in the wrong for enforcing the policy as stated, but if the policy itself is discriminatory, then the shop is at fault. However, since they do have a woman on contract, maybe they are trying to accommodate women when possible. The key is whether the policy is a legitimate business practice or a way to avoid serving women. The answer might depend on local laws regarding service denial based on gender or religion.\n"
