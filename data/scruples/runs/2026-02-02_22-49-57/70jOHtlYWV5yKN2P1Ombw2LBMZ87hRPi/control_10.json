We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about a barber shop that's mostly Muslim, and they have a policy where women need appointments because the main barbers can't cut women's hair due to religious reasons. The customer in question was a male-passing woman who didn't want to wait for an appointment. The author didn't cut her hair, leading to some backlash.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender or gender identity. Even if the business has religious beliefs, there might be laws requiring them to serve all customers equally. The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) requires businesses to make reasonable accommodations, but this seems more like a gender issue. The Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination because of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin. So here, the business is claiming a religious exemption, but the customer is transgender or gender non-conforming, which might fall under sex or gender identity protections.\n\nThe business's policy is that women need appointments because the male barbers can't cut their hair due to religious reasons. However, the customer is a male-passing woman, so maybe she doesn't identify as a woman? If the business requires appointments for women, but the customer doesn't identify as a woman, they might be refusing service based on gender identity, which could be illegal. Also, the policy might not account for non-binary or transgender individuals. \n\nThe business says they don't train for women's hair because of religion. But is that a valid defense? Religious freedom doesn't override anti-discrimination laws in this context. Courts often balance religious freedom with anti-discrimination, but if the business is open to the public, they might have to serve everyone regardless of gender or religion. \n\nThe customer was told they were transphobic, sexist, etc. The business argues they need the policy because of their staff's beliefs and the appointment system. However, if the customer is a woman (or identifies as such) and the policy requires appointments, but the business can't accommodate on the spot, maybe they could adjust their policy to be more inclusive. The author could have offered to schedule an appointment immediately, even if it's a few hours later, which might have resolved the issue. \n\nAlso, the staff's discomfort due to religious beliefs is part of the problem. If the employees are uncomfortable serving women, that's an internal issue the business should address, maybe by getting more trained staff or adjusting policies to comply with the law. The business can't use employees' personal beliefs as a reason to deny service to customers. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might be in the wrong because they refused service to a customer based on gender identity, which could be discriminatory. The policy might not be inclusive enough, and there's a legal obligation to serve all customers without discrimination, regardless of religious beliefs.\n"
