We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a manager at a barbershop that's mostly Muslim, with a policy that requires appointments for women because they have a contracted female barber. They got a customer who's a male-passing woman who wanted a men's haircut. The shop's policy is that they can only cut women's hair if it's family, and they don't train on women's hair due to religious reasons. The customer was upset, called them transphobic, etc., and they had to decline. The user is asking if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, the key points: the shop has clear policies stating they serve men and sometimes women with appointments. The customer identified as male-passing but wanted a men's cut. The shop's policy is based on religious beliefs, not the customer's gender identity. They have a specific arrangement for women's haircuts via their female barber. The customer felt discriminated against and left angry.\n\nNow, the main issue here is whether refusing the customer was wrong. The shop's policy isn't about gender identity but about the gender of the person being cut. The customer identifies as male but is biologically female. The shop's policy requires appointments for women, which this customer falls under. The shop's reasoning is religious, and they have a system in place to handle women's appointments. However, the customer might feel that because they present as male and want a men's cut, they should be treated like any other male customer. \n\nReligious exemptions are tricky. In many places, businesses can claim religious freedom, but that can conflict with anti-discrimination laws. However, if the shop openly states their policy and the customer didn't book an appointment, maybe they're within their rights. But if the policy is applied regardless of the customer's gender identity, that could be problematic. The shop's policy is based on biological sex, not gender identity. So if the customer is a woman (biologically) regardless of how they present, the shop's policy applies. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, this varies by location. Some places may allow religious exemptions, others not. The question is more about moral/ethical responsibility. The shop claims they aren't trained for women's haircuts and have religious reasons. The customer might see this as transphobic because they're being denied service based on their assigned sex at birth, not their gender identity. \n\nThe user feels they had to protect their employees' comfort and the quality of service. The customer, however, felt discriminated against. The answer hinges on whether the policy is applied based on gender identity or biological sex. If the shop's policy is based on biological sex and the customer is a woman, then it's not AITA. But if the policy is based on gender identity and the customer identifies as male, then the shop is in the wrong. But since the shop states their policy is about gender (women) and they have a system for handling appointments, and the customer is a woman regardless of presentation, the shop might not be in the wrong. However, the way it's presented might not consider gender identity, leading to conflict. \n\nIn the end, the shop has a clear policy they communicated, and they have a system in place. The customer didn't follow the policy. The shop's reasoning is based on their religious beliefs and operational setup. The answer is likely B, not in the wrong, but there's nuance. The key is whether the policy is applied consistently and based on the customer's biological sex as per the shop's stated policy, not their gender identity.\n"
