We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is a Muslim-run barbershop where they state they have a woman barber available by appointment. The customer was a male-passing woman who wanted a haircut but didn't have an appointment. The barbers refused to cut her hair because their policy is to require appointments for women, and none of the male employees (who are Muslim and follow religious rules against touching women's hair) were comfortable doing it. The customer felt discriminated against, called them transphobic, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender or gender identity. If the customer is a woman (or identifies as such), then the policy of only serving women by appointment might be problematic. The shop's policy says they serve all customers, but their practice might be excluding women unless they have an appointment. However, the shop does have a way to serve women through their contracted stylist, so maybe they aren't completely denying service, just requiring a different process.\n\nThe religious aspect: The employees have religious reasons for not cutting women's hair. But in many jurisdictions, religious exemptions don't extend to allowing discrimination against customers. For example, in the US, Title VII allows religious accommodations for employees but requires employers to make reasonable adjustments to avoid discrimination against customers. However, if the shop's policy is based on both the employees' religious beliefs and the business's stated practices, it's a gray area.\n\nAlso, the customer is a male-passing woman. Does that matter? If the shop's policy is based on the customer's gender (as perceived or as identified), then refusing service could be seen as discriminatory. If the shop doesn't make exceptions for people who are gender non-conforming, that might be an issue. The customer might feel that their gender expression should allow them to receive the same service as any other man. But if the shop's policy is gender-based for appointments, they might not be able to treat this customer differently without facing accusations of discrimination.\n\nAnother point: the shop mentions they don't train in women's hair due to religious reasons. But they have a contracted female stylist. So the issue isn't about ability to perform the service but about the policy and employee comfort. But if they can provide the service with the female stylist, then the refusal here could be considered a failure to accommodate, unless the female stylist wasn't available. However, the author says they needed a couple of hours notice to call her in. If the customer couldn't wait, then maybe that's a practical issue, but the refusal to even attempt to accommodate (by trying to reschedule or explain the policy) could be problematic.\n\nThe customer was upset and called them names. The author feels bad but is concerned about employee rights and service quality. However, the key question is whether the shop's policy constitutes discrimination. If the policy is applied even when a woman comes in clearly identifying as a woman (or male-passing woman), then regardless of the reasons, it might be seen as discriminatory. Especially since the shop does have a way to provide the service, just not immediately.\n\nIn terms of the AITA aspect, the author might not be in the wrong from their perspective, considering their policies and religious beliefs. But from a legal and ethical standpoint, denying service based on gender identity or expression could be problematic. The answer might depend on the jurisdiction's anti-discrimination laws regarding gender identity and religious exemptions. If the law allows businesses to have such policies based on religion, then the author isn't in the wrong. If not, then they are. Since the question is from the AITA perspective, which is more about social judgment rather than legal, but often legal considerations are part of it. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the answer is B (No), but I'm a bit conflicted because of the potential discrimination angle.\n"
