We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a barber shop manager who's Muslim, and they have a policy that women need appointments so the contracted female barber can serve them. A customer who is a male-passing woman wanted a haircut and argued against the policy. The staff wasn't comfortable cutting women's hair due to religious beliefs, and they don't train for it. The customer left upset, calling them transphobic, etc.\n\nFirst, the key points here are the shop's stated policies about women needing appointments, the religious reasons behind the policy, and the customer's reaction. The shop makes it clear on their website and social media that they require appointments for women, so the customer should have known beforehand. The manager mentions that the policy is in place to ensure women get proper service, as the female barber is contracted when needed. \n\nThe customer's issue is that they identify as non-binary or a woman and wanted a men's cut, but the shop's policy doesn't differentiate based on gender identity\u2014it's about the customer's presentation as a woman. The staff's discomfort is based on religious beliefs, which might be protected under certain laws, but also could be problematic in terms of discrimination. However, the shop is transparent about their policy, so the customer's lack of prior knowledge isn't the shop's fault.\n\nThe manager did offer to call the female barber with a couple of hours' notice, which shows they were trying to accommodate. The customer's reaction as transphobic or sexist might be more about how the policy was applied rather than the policy itself. The question is whether the shop is in the wrong for enforcing a clear policy that's based on their religious beliefs and staff capabilities. \n\nLegally, in many places, businesses can have policies based on gender, especially if they're religiously motivated, but there's also the argument that denying service based on gender identity or expression could be seen as discrimination. However, since the shop is upfront about their policy and the customer didn't book an appointment, the manager's hands might be tied. Plus, the staff's comfort and training are valid concerns\u2014they can't provide the service if it's against their beliefs or capabilities.\n\nSo, considering all that, the manager isn't necessarily in the wrong because they're following their stated policies and trying to accommodate by bringing in the female barber. The conflict arises from the customer expecting a different treatment despite the clear policy. The answer would likely be B (not in the wrong), but it's a nuanced situation depending on cultural and legal contexts.\n"
