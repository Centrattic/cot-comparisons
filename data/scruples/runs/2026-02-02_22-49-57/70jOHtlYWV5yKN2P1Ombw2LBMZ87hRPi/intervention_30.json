We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a barber who didn't cut a customer's hair because of their gender identity and the shop's policies based on religion. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The barbershop primarily serves men, has a woman barber available by appointment, and the staff isn't trained in women's hair due to religious reasons. The customer was a male-passing woman who wanted a men's cut but didn't have an appointment. The shop's policy requires appointments for women to ensure they can be served by the female barber. The staff wasn't comfortable cutting the customer's hair because of the religious rules. The customer accused them of being transphobic, etc.\n\nSo, the question is whether not cutting their hair under these circumstances is wrong. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to evaluate this.\n\nLegally, in many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity. However, religious exemptions might apply if the religious practices prevent serving certain groups. But there's a balance here. The shop has a policy to handle women's hair via appointments, which is a way to accommodate their religious beliefs. However, the customer here identifies as a male-passing woman, which complicates things. If the shop's policy is explicit about appointments for women, and the customer didn't have one, maybe they should have been aware. But if the customer's gender identity is male, does that change the policy? The shop might argue that appearance isn't the determining factor, but if their policy is based on perceived gender, that's a problem.\n\nEthically, it's tricky. The shop is trying to respect their employees' religious convictions, but refusing service to a trans man (if that's what the customer is) could be seen as discrimination. The customer might feel that their identity isn't acknowledged, and the shop is not making accommodations for that. The shop's solution would be to explain the policy and offer to schedule the female barber, but the customer didn't want to wait. That seems like a valid business policy, but if the customer's identity is male, the policy based on perceived gender is not appropriate.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the shop's signage and communication. If they clearly state that appointments are required for women, then perhaps the customer should have known. However, if the customer is transitioning or presents as male, the shop's policy might inadvertently exclude them without understanding their identity. The shop might need to review their policy to ensure it's inclusive, perhaps by asking about the customer's gender identity rather than relying on appearance.\n\nIn terms of the employees' comfort, the shop is protecting their right not to work against their religious beliefs, which is understandable. But the alternative is to have the female barber handle it, which the shop could do by scheduling her. The customer might not have realized the policy is based on gender, not the type of haircut. The shop could have explained that even for a men's cut, the appointment is needed if the customer is female. That's where the conflict arises.\n\nLegally, if the shop is in a place where religious exemptions don't cover this, they might be in the wrong. If the customer is trans and the shop isn't accommodating, that's a problem. However, if the shop is following their policy as stated and the customer didn't have an appointment, they might not be in the wrong from that perspective. But the way they handled it\u2014refusing service without accommodation\u2014could be seen as discriminatory regardless of policy.\n\nSo, considering all these angles, the answer hinges on whether the shop's policy is based on the customer's self-identified gender or perceived gender. If the policy is rigid and doesn't account for the customer's identity, the shop could be in the wrong. However, if they have a clear policy that's communicated and followed, and the customer didn't meet the conditions (appointment), then they might not be. But there's a strong argument that the policy itself is discriminatory towards trans individuals, regardless of their appearance. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not making an exception or not having a more inclusive policy.\n"
