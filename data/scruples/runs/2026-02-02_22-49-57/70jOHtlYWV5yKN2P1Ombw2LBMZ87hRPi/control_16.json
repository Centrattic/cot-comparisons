We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a barber shop manager who's primarily Muslim, and they have a policy that requires appointments for women because they don't train in women's hair due to religious reasons. They mention that they have a female barber on contract for appointments. The customer in question was a male-passing woman who wanted a men's style haircut. The manager refused because of the appointment policy, which is in place because of the religious rules about not touching women's hair unless it's family, and the lack of training for women's hair. The customer accused them of being transphobic, sexist, etc., and stormed out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity or expression. The customer is a transgender or gender non-conforming individual who presents as male but identifies as female. The shop's policy might be seen as discriminatory if it's based on gender. Even if the policy is intended to accommodate their religious beliefs, it's possible that the policy is not a valid exception. Religious exemptions don't always override anti-discrimination laws, especially when it comes to public accommodations. For example, in the US, Title VII allows religious practices, but public places must serve everyone regardless of gender identity.\n\nNext, the practical aspect: the shop has a female barber available for appointments. They could have offered to schedule an appointment with her. The manager mentioned that the customer wasn't listening to reason, but maybe the solution was to explain that while they can't do the cut in-house immediately, they can connect them with the female barber with a couple of hours notice. The refusal to even offer that option could be seen as discriminatory, even if the intention was based on religious beliefs.\n\nThe religious argument is tricky. While the employees' beliefs are valid, the business as a public entity might still be required to provide services without discrimination. The shop's policy could be a conflict between religious freedom and anti-discrimination laws. However, in many jurisdictions, religious exemptions have limits, especially when it comes to providing equal access to services.\n\nThe customer's perspective: they wanted a haircut, identified as male-passing, and the shop refused based on gender. If the customer is transgender or non-binary, this could be a case of gender identity discrimination. Even if the shop's policy is meant for women, the customer's gender identity might not align with the policy, leading to exclusion. The shop's signage and online mentions of their policy might be problematic if they don't account for all gender identities.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the manager's policy may be discriminatory. The fact that they have a female barber available suggests that the service is possible, but the policy is not accommodating to the customer's situation. The manager might be in the wrong for not making an exception or not offering the available solution, especially if they failed to communicate the option to schedule the female barber. The refusal to serve based on gender identity, even with religious reasons, could be seen as discriminatory. Therefore, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
