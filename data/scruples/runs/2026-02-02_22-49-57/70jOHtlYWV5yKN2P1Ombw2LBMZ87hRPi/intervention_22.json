We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not cutting a customer's hair. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a manager at a barbershop/salon that primarily serves men. They have a woman barber on contract for women's appointments. The shop is mostly Muslim, with varying levels of religious observance. The customer was a male-passing woman who wanted a men's style haircut. The shop's policy requires appointments for women because they don't serve women without appointments due to religious reasons\u2014male staff can't cut women's hair unless it's family. The customer got upset, called them transphobic, sexist, etc., and left.\n\nThe author thinks they're not in the wrong. The user agrees but wants my opinion. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer should be A or B.\n\nFirst, let me break down the key points. The shop's policy is clear: appointments for women only, because of religious guidelines. They have a female contractor for that. The customer identified as male-passing but wanted a men's cut. However, the shop's policy is based on gender (women need appointments), not gender identity. The customer might not have identified as a woman but presented as male, but the shop's policy is about biological sex, perhaps?\n\nWait, the customer is a woman who presents as male. The shop's policy is about serving women via appointments. So maybe the issue is whether the customer is considered a woman in this context. The shop doesn't train in women's hair because of religious reasons, so even if a woman comes in without an appointment, the male staff can't serve her. So the customer here is a woman (trans?) who didn't book an appointment. The shop can't serve her because they need a female barber, and they don't have one available that day without notice.\n\nThe shop's stance is based on religious beliefs. They state their policy publicly. However, the customer felt discriminated against. The shop is facing accusations of transphobia and sexism. \n\nIn terms of legal perspective, in many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity. But if their policy is based on biological sex, and the customer is a woman (even if presenting as male), they might still have to accommodate. However, if the shop's policy is based on religious beliefs, there might be some leeway, but it's a tricky area. \n\nBut the question isn't legal, it's about moral or ethical wrong. The author is standing by their policy, which is clear. They tried to offer the same price with a notice period. The customer wasn't willing to wait. The employees' comfort is also considered. \n\nHowever, the customer was a woman (biologically) seeking a service that the shop can't provide due to their policy. If the shop's policy is that women can't be served without an appointment, and the customer is a woman (even if presenting as male), then the policy is being followed. But the customer might feel that the policy is discriminatory. \n\nThe shop's policy is based on religious reasons, which they are allowed to have, but if it leads to denying service to a trans person, that's a point of contention. However, the customer is a woman (biologically) who may or may not be trans. The shop's policy is about gender, not gender identity. \n\nSo, from an ethical standpoint, the shop is following their stated policy, but the customer's experience is negative. The author is not in the wrong because they are adhering to their policy and religious beliefs. However, some might argue that the policy is discriminatory regardless of intent. But the author's stance is that they are not transphobic; they are following their religious guidelines. \n\nConsidering all that, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
