We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is a barber and manager at a shop that's mostly Muslim. They have a policy where women need appointments because they only have one female barber who's contracted. The customer in question was a male-passing woman who wanted a men's style haircut. The shop's policy states that women require appointments, but the customer argued it shouldn't matter. The staff wasn't comfortable cutting her hair due to religious reasons, and they refused, leading to the customer calling them transphobic, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the shop's stated policies. They mention on their website and signs that appointments are required for women. The customer might not have read or known about these policies. But if they did, and the customer didn't follow them, maybe the shop isn't wrong. However, the customer identified as a male-passing woman, so maybe they didn't realize they were being categorized as a woman for the appointment policy. \n\nThen there's the religious aspect. The staff isn't trained in women's haircuts due to religious beliefs, which is their right. But the shop is a business, so they should serve all customers unless there's a policy in place. However, the policy does require appointments for women, so if the customer didn't book one, the shop might not be at fault. \n\nBut the customer is trans, so maybe there's an issue with how the shop categorizes customers. If the customer identifies as male but presents as female, the shop's policy might be excluding them without considering their identity. The shop's policy is based on biological sex perhaps, but if the customer identifies as male, they might expect to be treated as such. \n\nThe shop manager is trying to protect their employees' religious beliefs, but also, by not accommodating a trans customer, they might be seen as discriminatory. However, the shop's website does state the policy, so maybe the customer is responsible for not following it. However, if the policy isn't clear or is based on gender identity, that's a problem. \n\nAlso, the shop could argue that they provided an appointment system for women, but the customer didn't use it. But if the customer didn't realize they were being classified as a woman, that's a communication issue. The staff's discomfort is based on religion, which is a protected belief, but the customer's rights as a service recipient might conflict here. \n\nIn some places, businesses can't refuse service based on gender identity. So even if the policy is in place for women, if the customer is trans and identifies as male, refusing service could be discrimination. The shop's policy might inadvertently exclude trans people, which could be problematic. \n\nThe manager's perspective is that they have a policy and the staff's comfort, but the customer's experience was negative. Legally and ethically, there's a tension here. Depending on the jurisdiction, the shop might be in the wrong if they're denying service to a protected class. \n\nSo considering all these factors, the answer might hinge on whether the shop's policy is inclusive of trans individuals and if they made exceptions or communicated their policy clearly. If the customer felt they were being discriminated against based on their gender identity, the shop could be at fault. But if they clearly stated their policy and the customer didn't comply, maybe not. It's a bit of a grey area, but I think the shop's policy might not be inclusive enough, leading them to be in the wrong.\n"
