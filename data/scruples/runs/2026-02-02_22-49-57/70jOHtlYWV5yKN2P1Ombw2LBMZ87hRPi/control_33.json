We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is a barber at a shop that's mostly Muslim, and they have a policy where women need appointments because they don't have enough female staff to cut their hair. The customer in question is a male-passing woman who wanted a men's haircut. The shop refused because their policy requires appointments for women, and they don't have any female employees available that day. The customer got upset, called them transphobic, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to check the specifics of the situation. The shop is clear about their policy on their website and social media. They mention that they mostly serve men and have a female stylist for women by appointment. The customer might not have known this, but the information is available. So, maybe the customer didn't check the appointment system before coming in.\n\nNext, the religious aspect comes into play. The employees are not allowed to touch women's hair except for family, which is why they have the appointment system. The author mentions that they don't train in women's hair due to religion. But the customer is a woman, and the shop is refusing service based on gender, which could be seen as a policy, but there's also the transgender angle here. The customer identifies as a woman but presents as male. The shop might be conflating gender identity with the physical aspects of hair (like texture, tools), but the customer is asking for a men's cut, which complicates things.\n\nThe key point here is whether the shop's policy discriminates against transgender individuals. If the policy is based on biological sex, then the customer, being a trans woman, might have a legitimate issue if the shop is not willing to serve them despite their appearance. However, the shop's policy is publicly stated, so maybe the customer is responsible for checking the appointment system. But the customer didn't have an appointment, and the shop couldn't provide service that day. The shop might be following their own policies and the customer is upset because of the transphobic accusations.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the shop's policies potentially being discriminatory under anti-discrimination laws in some regions. If the shop is refusing service to transgender people based on their gender identity, that could be problematic. However, the shop's policy is based on gender for the purpose of hair cutting, which might be a protected class in some places. The shop's reasoning is about the physical aspects of hair and employee comfort, which might be a defense, but if it's applied in a way that affects transgender people, that's where the conflict arises.\n\nThe shop's policy is to require appointments for women, but if the customer is a trans woman, does that make them fall under the \"women\" category for the policy? If yes, then the shop is following their policy. But if the customer is passing as male, maybe the shop should have made an exception. However, the shop's employees aren't trained in women's hair, so even if they tried to serve the customer, the staff might not know how to handle it properly, leading to a bad experience.\n\nAnother angle is the customer's right to service. In some places, businesses can have policies based on gender for hair services, but if they are not making accommodations for transgender individuals, that could be an issue. The shop might be violating anti-discrimination laws by not serving trans people, even if their policy is based on biological sex.\n\nAlso, the shop's refusal might be seen as transphobic because the customer is trans and is being denied service despite their appearance and request for a men's cut. The shop's policy might not account for gender identity, which is a different aspect from legal gender or appearance.\n\nIn conclusion, the shop's policy might be well-intentioned and based on their religious beliefs and operational constraints, but refusing service to a transgender woman who is presenting as male and requesting a men's cut could be considered discriminatory. The key factors are the clarity of the policy, the shop's adherence to it, and whether they are discriminating based on gender identity. If the policy is based on biological sex and the customer is a trans woman, the shop might be in the wrong by not making an exception. The fact that they couldn't provide service that day due to their own scheduling might not absolve them from responsibility if they are denying service based on gender identity.\n"

  "answer": "A",
  "full_response": "A\n\nThe author is in the wrong because the shop's policy, while based on religious beliefs and operational constraints, appears to have discriminated against a transgender individual presenting as male. By refusing service despite the customer's request for a men's haircut and their gender identity, the shop's actions could be perceived as transphobic. Policies based on biological sex may not account for gender identity, and the refusal to accommodate a transgender customer, regardless of the stated policy, likely violates principles of non-discrimination and inclusivity.",
