We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is a barber shop manager who didn't cut a customer's hair because the customer was a male-passing woman. They had a policy of requiring appointments for women because they don't have female staff trained in women's haircuts due to religious reasons. The customer was upset and accused them of being transphobic and sexist.\n\nFirst, the shop's policy is clear: they state on their website and signs that women need appointments. The reason given is that their staff isn't trained in women's haircuts due to religious beliefs. The manager mentions that they have a female stylist on contract for when appointments are needed. \n\nThe customer in question identified as a male-passing woman but wanted a men's cut. The shop's policy isn't about gender identity but about the training and comfort level of the staff. They explain that they can't touch women's hair unless it's family and that they don't train in women's hair because of their religion. The customer felt discriminated against.\n\nSo, the key points are: the policy is stated upfront, they have a way to accommodate women through appointments, and the staff's comfort and training are based on religious beliefs. The customer didn't want to book an appointment, leading to the conflict.\n\nNow, considering anti-discrimination laws in many places, especially in the US, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity. Even if the policy is in place, if it disproportionately affects transgender or non-binary individuals, it might be problematic. The shop's policy could be seen as excluding transgender men who present as male but identify as such. However, the shop's reasoning is based on their religious beliefs and the training of their staff. \n\nThere's a conflict between religious freedom and anti-discrimination laws here. In some cases, religious exemptions might allow businesses to opt out of certain services, but this is a gray area. The question is whether the policy, which is applied to all women regardless of gender identity, is discriminatory. \n\nThe manager argues they're not discriminating based on gender identity but on the need for specific training and the staff's comfort. However, the customer felt it was a direct refusal based on their gender expression, which could be seen as transphobic. \n\nThe answer depends on jurisdiction and specific laws. But from an ethical standpoint, the shop might be seen as not in the wrong because they have a stated policy and a way to serve women (appointments). However, the customer's experience and feelings are valid, and the shop's policy might not be inclusive of all gender identities, which could be considered discriminatory despite their stated reasons.\n"
