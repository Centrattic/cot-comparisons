We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a bit complex because it involves religious beliefs, business policies, and discrimination claims.\n\nFirst, the barbershop has a policy that requires appointments for women because they have a female barber who works on a contract basis. The customer in question is a male-passing woman who wanted a men's haircut. The barbershop's policy is based on the religious belief that male barbers can't cut women's hair unless they are family. The staff isn't trained for women's hair, and they have specific tools and products for that. The customer felt discriminated against and accused them of being transphobic and sexist.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the business's policy is due to religious beliefs and practical training, but the customer argues that it's discriminatory. The question is whether the author (manager) is in the wrong for not cutting the customer's hair despite their request.\n\nIn the US, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act allows for religious accommodations in business practices. However, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity or sex. But there's a nuance here. If the business's policy is based on religious beliefs, there might be some leeway, but if the policy disproportionately affects transgender or non-binary individuals, it could be problematic. \n\nThe key issue is whether the business's policy is a bona fide religious requirement. If the staff isn't trained to cut women's hair and has a policy in place to handle that, but the customer identifies as a woman who is male-passing and wants a men's cut, the business's refusal might be seen as discriminatory. Especially since the customer is transgender or non-binary, the policy might not account for their identity and could be infringing on their rights. \n\nAlso, the business requires appointments for women, but this customer is male-passing, so maybe they didn't realize the policy. The manager could have offered to schedule the female barber if given time. However, the staff was uncomfortable, but the business's policy should have a process to handle such cases, like calling in the female barber even if it takes time. \n\nReligious exemptions don't necessarily override anti-discrimination laws. The Supreme Court case Masterpiece Cakeshop vs. Colorado Civil Rights Commission said that businesses can't deny services based on religious beliefs if it violates anti-discrimination laws. So if the policy is seen as discriminatory, the business might be in the wrong. \n\nIn this case, by not accommodating the customer and not making an exception (like trying to contact the female barber even if it takes time), the business might be seen as violating anti-discrimination laws. The customer's gender identity is a factor here, and the business's refusal could be considered discriminatory. \n\nTherefore, the author might be in the wrong because the policy, while based on religious beliefs, doesn't account for the customer's identity and the business's obligation to serve all customers without discrimination. The staff's comfort level isn't a valid reason to deny service if there's a way to accommodate them, even if it requires some effort.\n"
