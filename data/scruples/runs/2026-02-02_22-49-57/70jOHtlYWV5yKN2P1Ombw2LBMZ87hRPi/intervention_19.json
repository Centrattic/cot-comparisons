We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the barber (the author) is in the wrong for not cutting a customer's hair. The customer is a male-passing woman who wanted a men's cut, but the shop has a policy requiring appointments for women because they don't have female barbers on staff except for a contracted one. The shop is primarily Muslim, and their policy is based on religious beliefs about not cutting women's hair unless it's family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender or gender identity unless there's a bona fide occupational qualification. For example, some states have laws that allow religious exemptions, but others don't. If the shop is a private business, they might have some leeway, but there's a line between religious practice and discrimination. \n\nThen there's the religious aspect. The shop's policy is rooted in their faith, which is protected under religious freedom. However, if this policy denies service based on gender identity, it could be seen as discriminatory. The customer identified as male-passing but wanted a men's cut, so maybe they felt the policy was arbitrary. The shop's stance might be considered transphobic if they're denying service based on the customer's gender identity rather than biological sex.\n\nAlso, the shop mentions that they don't train employees on women's hair due to religion. This could be a problem if it's leading to unequal service. The customer was upset and accused them of being transphobic, which adds another layer. Even if the policy is based on religion, the way it's applied might not consider the customer's identity.\n\nOn the other hand, the shop manager says they state the policy clearly on their website and signs, so the customer had prior knowledge. But if the customer didn't realize the policy or felt it was unfair, the shop's communication might not be effective. The manager also mentions that the female barber is contracted on an appointment basis, so they could have offered to reschedule her if given notice. However, the customer was unwilling to wait, leading to the conflict.\n\nBalancing religious freedom and anti-discrimination laws is tricky. Some places might side with the shop's religious practices, while others prioritize non-discrimination. The key here is whether the policy is applied consistently and if there's a genuine religious requirement. If the shop is willing to serve women through appointments, perhaps the issue is more about the customer not complying with the notice period. But if the customer is trans and the policy doesn't accommodate their identity, that's a different angle.\n\nIn conclusion, there's a conflict between religious practices and potential discrimination. The answer might depend on local laws and how the policy is framed. If the shop's policy is based on religious beliefs and they clearly communicate it, they might not be in the wrong. However, if the policy is seen as excluding transgender individuals based on gender identity, they could be considered discriminatory regardless of religion. The manager's intent to protect employees and provide quality service is there, but the outcome led to the customer feeling mistreated. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) if the policy is clearly stated and based on religious practices, but this is context-dependent.\n"
