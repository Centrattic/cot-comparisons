We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a barber shop that primarily serves men and has specific religious policies. The situation is that a customer who is a male-passing woman came in without an appointment and was denied a haircut because the shop's policy requires appointments for women due to religious reasons and training constraints.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The shop has a policy stated publicly that they require appointments for women. The reason given is both religious (not allowing male staff to cut women's hair) and practical (different techniques/products for women's hair). The customer in question identifies as a male-passing woman but wanted a men's cut. The staff didn't feel comfortable cutting her hair, so they refused the service. The customer accused them of being transphobic, sexist, etc., and left in anger.\n\nNow, considering the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, businesses can have certain policies based on religion, but there might be anti-discrimination laws that require serving all customers regardless of gender identity. However, the shop's policy is clearly stated in their marketing, so they might be within their rights to not serve women unless it's by appointment. But the complication here is the customer's gender identity. If the customer is transgender or non-binary presenting as male, does that change the situation? Some jurisdictions have protections for gender identity, so refusing service based on that could be problematic.\n\nThe shop's reasoning is based on their religious beliefs, but there's a balance between religious freedom and anti-discrimination laws. Also, the fact that they have a female employee who can be scheduled for women's appointments suggests they have a system in place. However, the customer might not know about the appointment system or expected to be accommodated on the spot. The shop requires a few hours' notice to bring in the female barber, but the customer didn't provide that notice.\n\nAnother angle: the shop's policy might be seen as discriminatory if it's not applied consistently. For example, if a cisgender woman comes in without an appointment, would they be denied? If the policy is strictly enforced regardless of gender, then maybe it's less of an issue. But if the policy is based on the gender of the customer (as perceived by the staff), that could be more problematic, especially if the customer is trans or non-binary.\n\nAdditionally, the staff's comfort level based on religious beliefs is part of the issue. But if the customer is male-passing, maybe the staff's discomfort is not based on gender identity but on the customer's sex. This could touch on whether the shop's policy is based on the customer's biological sex versus their gender identity, which is a sensitive area legally.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the shop's stated policy. Since they advertise that they have a female barber available for appointments, maybe the customer is within their rights to request the service and expect to be accommodated even if it requires an appointment. However, if the appointment system isn't for customers but for the shop's internal management, that might not hold up legally if the policy is to only serve women by appointment.\n\nI should also consider if the shop's policy is a form of indirect discrimination. By requiring appointments for women but not men, they might be limiting access, especially if the female barber is not always available. If the customer couldn't wait for the appointment, is that a problem? The shop's policy might be valid in terms of their religious practices, but if it creates a barrier to service, it could be discriminatory.\n\nIn some places, businesses can't refuse service based on gender identity. If the customer is trans and presents as male, they might be protected under anti-discrimination laws. The shop's refusal could be seen as transphobic even if their intention is religious. The balance between religious freedom and anti-discrimination laws is a gray area, but in many cases, anti-discrimination laws take precedence when it comes to public services.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The shop's policy is based on religious beliefs and practical training. However, the refusal to serve a trans or non-binary customer presenting as male could be seen as discriminatory. The fact that they have a system in place to accommodate women's haircuts (the female barber) suggests they can make exceptions, but the customer might not have known about the appointment system. The shop's policy is publicly stated, which is good, but applying it in a way that denies service to a trans customer might be in the wrong.\n"
