We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a barber who didn't cut a customer's hair because they're a male-passing woman, and the shop has a policy requiring appointments for women since they only have a female barber available on contract. The customer accused them of being transphobic and sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the policies mentioned. The shop clearly states they require appointments for women because they don't have a regular female barber. The author tried to explain that their religious beliefs prevent male employees from cutting women's hair unless it's family. They also mention that they can't train in women's hair due to religion. The customer, who identifies as a male-passing woman, wanted a men's cut but wasn't given an appointment because the policy is based on gender.\n\nThe key points here are the shop's stated policies and their religious reasons. However, the customer's gender identity complicates things. If the customer is a woman, even if they pass as male, the shop's policy would apply. But if the shop is following a religious rule that prevents men from cutting women's hair, they might be justified in their policy. However, in many places, discrimination based on gender identity is illegal, and businesses can't refuse service based on that. The shop's policy is based on the customer's gender as perceived by the shop, which might not align with the customer's actual gender identity. \n\nThe author might be in the wrong if the policy is discriminatory against transgender or gender non-conforming individuals. Even if the policy is in place for religious reasons, some jurisdictions require accommodations for gender identity. The author's refusal could be seen as both religious and discriminatory, which might be a conflict. Also, the customer was denied service without being offered an alternative (like the appointment), which the author mentions could have been arranged with a few hours' notice. The fact that the customer was told to make an appointment but refused might indicate the shop's policy isn't clearly communicated or that there's inconsistency in enforcement.\n\nIn summary, the author might be in the wrong if their policy disproportionately affects transgender individuals and doesn't make exceptions for those who don't fit the binary gender the policy was designed for. Religious exemptions might not cover discrimination based on gender identity in many places. So, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
