We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is a barber shop manager, and they didn't cut a customer's hair because the customer was a male-passing woman. The shop has a policy that women need appointments because they contract a female barber. The reason given is religious\u2014Muslim staff can't touch women's hair unless it's family. The customer got angry, called them transphobic, etc. The manager is asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The shop is Muslim-majority, and there's a religious rule against male staff cutting women's hair. They have a policy to require appointments for women so the female contractor can handle it. The customer in question identified as a male-passing woman, wanted a men's cut, but the staff weren't comfortable. The manager tried to explain they needed notice to get the female barber, but the customer left upset.\n\nNow, the key points here: religious accommodation vs. discrimination. The shop isn't refusing service to women in general; they have a way to serve them through the female contractor. However, the customer here is a trans man or a non-binary person who presents as male. Their gender identity is important here. If the shop's policy is based on the customer's assigned gender at birth rather than their gender identity, that could be problematic. But the shop's policy is based on the customer being female, not considering gender identity.\n\nIn terms of religious freedom, the employees are allowed to follow their beliefs. However, in many places, businesses can't refuse service based on gender identity. For example, in the US, the Civil Rights Act prohibits discrimination in public accommodations based on gender, including gender identity. So if the shop is in a place with such laws, their policy might be discriminatory.\n\nThe manager's argument is that they can't train staff on women's hair due to religious reasons, hence the policy. But if the customer is gender-identifying as male, maybe they should be classified under male customers, even if they were assigned female at birth. However, the shop's policy is based on the customer's sex as per their appearance or biological factors. There's a conflict here between the customer's identity and the shop's religious policy.\n\nAdditionally, the shop does serve women through the contractor, so the policy isn't a complete refusal. But in this case, the customer was told they couldn't be served that day without an appointment, which they didn't have. The manager tried to explain they needed time to get the female barber, but the customer was upset.\n\nThe manager is Muslim, so their religious beliefs are a factor. However, public accommodation laws in many places override religious exemptions when it comes to discrimination. So the shop might be violating anti-discrimination laws by refusing service to someone based on gender identity or sex, even if it's for religious reasons.\n\nAnother angle: the shop's signage and online presence make it clear that women need appointments. If the customer wasn't aware, maybe they should have checked beforehand. But if the customer presented as male, they might not have known they needed an appointment, which could be on the shop's communication. However, the customer's gender identity complicates things.\n\nIn summary, while the shop has a policy rooted in religious beliefs, their refusal to serve a trans or non-binary customer who presents as male could be considered discriminatory under anti-discrimination laws. The manager might be in the wrong because their policy doesn't account for gender identity, and they failed to provide service despite having a way to do so (the contractor). Even if they can't train staff on women's hair, they still have a method to serve women, which should include trans men or non-binary individuals who identify as male. The customer was denied service based on their sex assigned at birth, which could be illegal, and the manager's explanation doesn't hold up under legal scrutiny. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
