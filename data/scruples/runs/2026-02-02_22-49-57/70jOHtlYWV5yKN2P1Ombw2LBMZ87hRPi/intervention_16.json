We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The scenario involves a barber who didn't cut a customer's hair because the customer was a male-passing woman, and the shop has a policy requiring appointments for women due to religious reasons and lack of training.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the policies mentioned. The barbershop clearly states on their website, Facebook, etc., that they require appointments for women. The reason given is both religious (not allowing male staff to touch women's hair except family, which is common in some interpretations of Islamic modesty laws) and practical (different tools/products needed). The shop has a female barber on contract for such cases. The customer in question didn't book an appointment and insisted it shouldn't matter because they wanted a men's style. The staff wasn't comfortable cutting their hair, leading to the refusal and the customer storming out, accusing the shop of transphobia, sexism, etc.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author isn't wrong. Let me break down the key points. The shop had a clear policy in place, communicated through various channels. They have a system in place to accommodate women, which requires advance notice. The customer didn't follow the policy, and the shop couldn't make an exception because of staff availability and religious guidelines. The staff's discomfort is also a factor here, as they might feel pressured or uncomfortable violating their religious beliefs.\n\nFrom a policy standpoint, the shop isn't in the wrong because they followed their stated procedures. They provided an alternative (the female barber) when given proper notice. The customer's frustration is understandable, but they didn't adhere to the shop's requirements. However, there's a potential issue with accessibility. If the shop is in a location where other options are limited, not providing the service could be problematic. But the shop isn't obligated to serve everyone if they have a valid policy.\n\nReligious exemptions are often protected in many places, allowing businesses to operate based on faith, as long as they don't discriminate based on protected categories. Here, the refusal isn't based on gender identity but on the customer's gender as per the shop's policy. The customer is a male-passing woman, so under the shop's policy, they are considered a woman needing an appointment. The shop isn't refusing service based on trans identity but on the gender aspect of their policy. However, this could be a gray area. If the customer identifies as male, but presents as male and wants a men's cut, the policy might not apply. But the shop's policy is based on the customer's gender as per their own perception, which complicates things.\n\nThe staff's refusal could also be about personal comfort and religious beliefs. They aren't forced to provide a service they disagree with, which is a common debate in religious exemption cases. For instance, in some cases, businesses can deny services if it conflicts with their beliefs, though this is legally complex and varies by jurisdiction.\n\nOn the other hand, the customer argues they were discriminated against as a trans person. If the shop refused based on the customer's gender identity, that could be a different issue. But if the policy is based on the customer's gender (as perceived by the shop or by the customer's own declaration), it's tricky. The shop might be enforcing a policy that inadvertently affects trans individuals, but if the policy is consistent for all perceived genders, then it's more about the policy itself rather than discrimination against trans people.\n\nIn conclusion, the shop had a clear policy in place, communicated it, and provided an alternative when possible. The author followed the policy, and the staff's personal beliefs were respected. The customer didn't adhere to the policy's requirements. While the situation is sensitive, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong if the policy is applied consistently and the alternatives are available. However, there might be room for improvement in how they handle such situations to be more inclusive, but legally and according to their stated policies, they might be justified.\n"
