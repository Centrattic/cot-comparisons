We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not cutting a customer's hair. The situation involves a barber shop with specific policies related to gender and religion. \n\nFirst, I need to parse the details. The barbershop mainly serves men, has a woman stylist on contract for appointments, and explicitly states this on their website and signs. The customer in question is a male-passing woman who wants a men's cut but didn't have an appointment. The shop's policy requires appointments for women to ensure they can be served by the female stylist. The staff isn't trained in women's haircuts due to religious reasons, and none felt comfortable doing it.\n\nThe author explains that their religion prohibits male staff from cutting women's hair except for family members. The customer was upset, called them transphobic, etc., and left in a huff. The author is questioning if they did the wrong thing by not adjusting the policy in this case.\n\nSo, from a legal standpoint, in many places, businesses can have religious exemptions, but there are also anti-discrimination laws. However, the shop is upfront about their policy. They do serve women through appointments. The customer didn't book an appointment, so maybe the shop isn't obligated to provide service outside their stated policies. \n\nBut there's also the social aspect. The customer identifies as male-passing, which complicates things. If the shop had a policy that applies only to cisgender women, but the customer is a transgender man, that might be different. However, the shop's policy is based on gender as per their religious beliefs, not the customer's identity. \n\nThe author mentions that the female stylist is contracted for appointments. The customer could have made an appointment. The author argues that they can't provide a proper service without the right training and tools, which might be a legitimate business concern. However, refusing service based on gender could be seen as discriminatory, especially if the shop is in a jurisdiction that protects gender identity.\n\nBut the shop is transparent about their policies. They aren't hiding the fact that they serve women via appointments, and they state that upfront. The customer may have not checked the website or signs. In that case, the shop isn't wrong for enforcing their policies as stated. \n\nHowever, the customer's experience is also important. They might have felt discriminated against, particularly if they identify as male and the shop is treating them as female. There's a line between religious practice and discrimination. If the shop can make an exception in this case without violating their beliefs, maybe they should. But if the policy is firm and based on religious training, they might not be in the wrong for sticking to it.\n\nI need to consider if the author had the option to accommodate. The author says they could have called in the female employee with a couple of hours notice, but the customer wasn't willing to wait. The author's stance is that the policy is in place for the staff's comfort and service quality. If the customer is willing to wait, the shop could accommodate, but the customer was unwilling. \n\nIn this case, the shop's policy is clear, they do serve women through appointments, and they're not hiding that. They also mention that they're a religious business, which may allow them certain exemptions. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong for enforcing their policy consistently, especially since they offer an alternative (appointments for women). The customer's frustration might stem from not understanding or accepting the policy, but the shop isn't obligated to serve them outside their stated procedures.\n"
