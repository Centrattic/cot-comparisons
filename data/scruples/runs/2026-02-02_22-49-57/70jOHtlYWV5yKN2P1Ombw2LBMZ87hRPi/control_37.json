We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the user is a barber shop manager, and they had a customer who was a male-passing woman. The customer wanted a haircut but wasn't making an appointment. The shop's policy requires women to have appointments because they only have a female barber available. The customer argued that they wanted a men's cut and it shouldn't matter. The staff didn't feel comfortable cutting the customer's hair due to religious reasons. The customer got upset and accused them of being transphobic and sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity. Even if the shop has a policy for women, if the customer identifies as a woman but presents as a male-passing individual, it might complicate things. But the shop's policy is stated publicly about requiring appointments for women, which they have to enforce. However, if the customer is non-binary or transgender, the business might be seen as not accommodating their needs.\n\nNext, the religious aspect. The shop's policy is based on religious beliefs about not cutting women's hair. But in some areas, religious exemptions might not override anti-discrimination laws. If the customer is trans, their gender identity is a protected class in many jurisdictions. The shop's stated policy might be considered discriminatory if it prevents someone from accessing services based on their gender identity.\n\nThe shop also mentions they don't train employees on women's hair due to religion. If they have a female barber available by appointment, they might still need to handle such cases, but if the customer doesn't fit neatly into male or female, the policy might not be followed correctly. The customer could be seen as female-presenting but identifying differently, leading to confusion in applying the policy.\n\nThe employee's discomfort isn't a valid reason to deny service. Even if some staff are uncomfortable, the business should have a system in place (like the female barber) to handle such cases. The manager's refusal to accommodate might be seen as refusing service to a protected class, which could be illegal.\n\nAlso, the customer's argument that they wanted a men's cut doesn't align with the shop's policy based on gender. But if the policy is based on the customer's gender identity, that's where the conflict arises. If the shop's policy is based on perceived gender rather than identity, it could be problematic for trans customers.\n\nIn summary, the shop's policy might be discriminatory if they deny service to someone based on gender identity, even if they have a female barber available. The manager could be in the wrong if they're not accommodating customers who don't fit the traditional male/female categories. The answer might be A (they are in the wrong) because the policy could be discriminatory against trans or non-binary individuals, violating anti-discrimination laws.\n"
