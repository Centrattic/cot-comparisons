We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The author is a barber and manager at a shop that primarily serves men, with a policy requiring appointments for women because they hire a female barber on a contract basis. They mention that due to their Muslim faith, the male staff aren't trained or comfortable cutting women's hair, so they need to book the female contractor. \n\nThe situation involves a customer who is a male-passing woman wanting a men's style haircut. The shop refused to cut her hair without an appointment, which would require bringing in the female barber. The customer accused them of being transphobic and sexist, and they left in anger.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity or gender expression. However, there are exceptions for religious beliefs. The shop's policy is based on religious practices, which might be protected under certain laws. But the key here is whether the service denial was based on the customer's gender identity. If the customer is a woman who presents as male, the shop might be denying her service because of her gender, not her gender identity. This is a bit of a gray area.\n\nAlso, the shop's policy is to require appointments for women, which is stated publicly. If the customer identified as a woman (even if she presents as male), the shop would need to schedule the female barber. But if the customer identified as male, then the policy might not apply. However, the customer's gender identity versus their presentation is crucial here. If the shop denied service based on their appearance rather than their stated identity, that could be problematic.\n\nAnother angle is the shop's religious practices. They mention that they have varying levels of religious adherence among employees. Their policy of not cutting women's hair is based on religious beliefs. In some jurisdictions, religious exemptions might allow this, but others might require reasonable accommodation for customers. The shop is offering an alternative by scheduling the female barber with a couple of hours' notice, which seems like a reasonable solution. However, the customer might not have wanted to wait, leading to frustration.\n\nThe author argues that they have a policy in place and are trying to protect their employees' religious comfort. However, the customer felt discriminated against. The main issue is whether the denial of service was based on the customer's gender identity (which could be protected) or their gender as perceived by the shop (which might be different). If the shop is adhering to a policy that's publicly stated and offers an alternative, they might have a case. But if they refused based on the customer's appearance without considering their identity, that's more concerning.\n\nAdditionally, the shop's reasoning about different tools and training for women's hair is a bit of a red herring. If they can accommodate women with their female barber, then the issue is more about the policy and how it's applied rather than the technical ability to perform the service. The fact that they don't train in women's hair because of religion is a key point. However, if the customer is a woman, regardless of presentation, the shop should still have a process to serve her.\n\nIn conclusion, the shop's policy might be based on religious beliefs, but if they are denying service to a woman (even if she presents as male) without allowing her to schedule the appropriate barber, that could be seen as discriminatory. The author's failure to accommodate the customer's request by scheduling the female barber, despite the customer's explanation, could be the issue. The answer might depend on local laws, but generally, businesses are expected to serve all customers unless there's a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason.\n"
