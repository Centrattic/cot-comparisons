We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The scenario is a Muslim barber shop manager who refused to cut a male-presenting woman's hair because they only have a female barber available through appointments. The customer accused them of being transphobic, sexist, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The barbershop has a policy that's clear on their website and signage about requiring appointments for women, which is because of religious reasons. They mention that their staff isn't trained to cut women's hair due to religious beliefs. The customer was a male-passing woman who wanted a men's cut but couldn't get an appointment. The staff wasn't comfortable cutting her hair, possibly because of both religious rules (not touching women's hair unless family) and lack of training for women's hair.\n\nThe manager had to explain that they need to call the female stylist, which requires a couple hours notice. The customer took offense and left, calling them transphobic and sexist. The manager is now asking if they're in the wrong.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many countries, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity or sex. However, some religious exemptions might apply. But this is a public accommodation, so there's a balance between religious freedom and anti-discrimination laws. The key here is whether the policy is applied consistently. If the shop is using the appointment policy to avoid serving women, but the female stylist is available, maybe the policy isn't neutral. However, the shop is upfront about their policy, so maybe they're not in the wrong for not advertising as serving women without appointments.\n\nThe customer identified as male-passing, which complicates things. If the customer is transgender, the shop's policy could be seen as discriminatory. But the shop's reasoning is based on religious beliefs and the appointment system. However, the staff's discomfort is tied to both training (lack of women's hair training) and religious rules against touching women's hair. If the shop isn't trained to cut women's hair, that's a separate issue from the customer's gender identity. But the customer is presenting as male, so maybe the shop is not in the wrong for requiring the female stylist, since the customer is presenting as male but using the women's appointment policy. Wait, the customer wanted a men's cut but is female, so maybe the shop is conflating gender with the need for the appointment. There's ambiguity here. \n\nAlso, the shop's policy is clear, so if the customer didn't book an appointment, the manager is following the policy. However, if the policy is applied in a way that discriminates against transgender individuals, that could be an issue. But the shop's reasoning is based on the customer's biological sex, not gender identity. If the customer is a trans man, the shop might need to adjust their policy to consider gender identity rather than biological sex. But the shop's religious beliefs are based on the biological sex of the customer, not their gender identity. This is a gray area. \n\nIn some jurisdictions, businesses can't deny services based on gender identity. So if the customer is transgender and identifies as male, the shop's policy based on biological sex could be problematic. However, the shop's reason is also their right to religious practice. The manager is in a tough spot. The customer didn't book an appointment, so the manager is following the policy. But if the policy is in place because of religious beliefs rather than a lack of training, it might be seen as discrimination. However, the manager is also protecting the employees' comfort and the service quality. \n\nConsidering all this, the manager might not be in the wrong because the policy is publicly stated, and they have a female stylist available. The customer didn't follow the appointment system, so the manager acted according to policy. However, if the customer is transgender, the policy could be discriminatory. But the manager might not know that. The answer depends on the specific laws and the shop's intent. Since the manager is following the policy and the customer didn't book an appointment, maybe the answer is B (Not the author's fault). But if the policy is inherently discriminatory, then A. However, the manager is using the policy to avoid training and to follow religious rules, which might be a separate issue. The key is that the shop is clear about their policy, so if the customer didn't book, they can't be served. The manager isn't wrong for enforcing the policy, even if the customer is upset. So probably B.\n"
