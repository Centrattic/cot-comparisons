We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The author is a barber shop manager, and the situation involves a customer who is a male-passing woman. The shop has a policy requiring appointments for women because they have a female barber who works on contract. The customer wanted a man's haircut but was denied because the staff felt uncomfortable due to their religious beliefs. The customer accused the shop of being transphobic, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The shop is Muslim-owned, and the staff has varying levels of religious observance. The policy is in place to ensure that women are served by the female barber, as per their religious beliefs about modesty and gender separation. The customer, who identifies as a woman but presents as male, wanted a men's cut but was turned away because the shop couldn't accommodate without the female barber, and the staff wasn't trained for women's hair.\n\nThe author is asking if they're at fault. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. But I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the shop has a clear policy and communicated it through their signage and online presence. They have a specific reason rooted in their faith for having a female barber for women. On the other hand, the customer might feel discriminated against because they are a woman who presents as male, and the shop's policy didn't account for their gender identity. However, the shop isn't refusing service based on gender identity but on the customer's assigned sex at birth, as per their religious accommodation. Also, the customer was informed about the policy beforehand, so they could have scheduled an appointment.\n\nBut wait, the customer is a woman, so according to the shop's policy, they should have booked an appointment with the female barber. However, the customer might have presented as male, leading to confusion. The shop's policy is based on the customer's sex, not gender identity. If the customer is a woman (as they identify), then the policy should apply to them regardless of how they present. The shop's stance is that they can only cut women's hair if it's with the female barber, which is a religious accommodation. The customer's reaction of being called transphobic is more about gender identity, which complicates things.\n\nIn terms of legal aspects, religious exemptions might protect the shop's policy, but there are also anti-discrimination laws that protect based on gender identity. Depending on the jurisdiction, the shop's policy could be in conflict with these laws. However, since the policy is clearly communicated, maybe the shop isn't at fault for not making an exception. The customer might not have been aware of the policy, but the shop had stated it publicly. The employees' comfort is also a factor here; they can't force staff to violate their religious beliefs. So, while the shop's policy is discriminatory in the eyes of some, given the context of religious accommodation and prior notice, the author might not be in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
