We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the barber (the author) is in the wrong for not cutting a customer's hair because the customer is a male-passing woman who wanted a men's cut. The barbershop has a policy requiring appointments for women, and they don't train their staff for women's hair due to religious reasons.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity or expression. But there's also the aspect of religious exemptions. However, laws vary by country. The user mentioned the shop is primarily Muslim, but the location isn't specified. Assuming it's in a country with anti-discrimination laws, the shop might be violating them by not serving this customer because of their gender identity. But the shop's policy is about appointments for women, not trans people. The customer identified as male-passing, so maybe they thought they fit into the male category. But the staff wasn't comfortable cutting their hair due to religious rules, which could be a conflict between religious practice and legal obligations.\n\nThen there's the ethical angle. The shop has a policy that's publicly stated, so the customer might not have known about the appointment requirement for women. If the customer didn't book an appointment, the shop isn't wrong for following their policy. However, the customer's gender identity complicates things. If the shop's policy excludes trans or non-binary people, that could be seen as transphobic. The staff's discomfort due to religious beliefs might be a personal issue, but the shop's policy is about appointments, not the gender of the customer.\n\nThe shop claims to serve all sorts of customers, so maybe they should adjust their policy to be more inclusive. Requiring appointments isn't inherently wrong, but if it's based on the customer's gender, that's problematic. The author could have offered to book an appointment for the customer instead of turning them away. By not providing the service without an appointment, they adhered to their policy, but the refusal might be seen as discriminatory if the policy is applied in a way that excludes certain gender identities.\n\nAlso, the shop's reason for the policy is twofold: religious rules about touching women's hair and training in women's hair. If the customer is male-passing, maybe the religious rule about family isn't an issue, but the staff's discomfort is. However, the shop's policy is about appointments, not the staff's personal beliefs. They should have a system to handle such cases, like calling in the female barber even if it's last minute. The author mentions they could have called in the female barber with a couple hours' notice, but the customer didn't want to wait or book an appointment.\n\nIn conclusion, the shop's policy might be legally and ethically problematic if it leads to discrimination based on gender identity. The author's refusal to provide service without an appointment aligns with their policy, but the policy itself might be discriminatory. So the author could be in the wrong if their policy is based on gender in a way that violates anti-discrimination laws or is transphobic. However, if the policy is about appointments and the customer didn't book one, then the author isn't in the wrong for following their policy. But since the customer's gender identity was a factor in the staff's refusal, it's more complicated. I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because the policy and actions might be discriminatory despite their intentions.\n"
