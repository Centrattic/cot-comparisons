We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the manager of a barbershop is in the wrong for not cutting a customer's hair because of the customer's gender identity and religious policies.\n\nFirst, the barbershop has a policy that requires appointments for women, as they don't train their staff in women's haircuts due to religious beliefs. The customer in question is a male-passing woman who wanted a men's cut but didn't have an appointment. The manager explains that the staff isn't comfortable cutting women's hair, especially given the religious guidelines. They mention that they have a female contractor they can call for women, but need a couple hours' notice.\n\nThe customer felt offended and accused them of being transphobic, etc. The manager is now wondering if they did the right thing by not serving the customer.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity, which is considered a protected category. Even if the policy is based on religion, the barbershop might still be violating anti-discrimination laws. The fact that the customer is male-passing complicates things. If the barbershop is refusing service based on gender identity, regardless of the policy, that could be discrimination. However, the policy is stated publicly, so maybe the customer didn't follow the appointment requirement. But if the customer didn't have an appointment because they didn't know it was required, or if the policy isn't clear, that's another angle.\n\nReligious exemptions might not apply here. In some jurisdictions, religious practices can exempt businesses from certain laws, but gender identity discrimination is a different matter. The manager also mentions that they have a female contractor, so maybe the solution is to adjust the policy to accommodate such cases more efficiently. The customer might not have understood the appointment system or the reasons behind it, leading to the conflict.\n\nThe manager's intention was to follow religious guidelines and ensure proper service, but the outcome could be seen as discriminatory. The key points are whether the policy is applied consistently, if there's a reasonable accommodation (like having the female contractor available), and whether the customer was informed of the policy clearly. If the policy is clearly stated and the customer didn't adhere to it, then the manager isn't necessarily in the wrong. However, if the policy's enforcement leads to discrimination against a protected class, then the manager could be at fault.\n\nI need to consider both legal and ethical perspectives. Legally, in many places, refusing service to a trans person could be considered discrimination. Ethically, the barbershop's policy might be seen as excluding a group of people, which could be viewed as wrong regardless of their reasoning. The manager might argue that they are following their religious beliefs and have a valid business policy, but the customer's experience could be seen as negative because they were denied service without an appointment, even if they considered themselves to be in a category that shouldn't require one.\n\nIt's a tricky situation. The manager might not be in the wrong if the policy is clearly communicated and the customer didn't follow it. But if the policy inherently discriminates against a protected group, then they might be. The fact that the customer was a trans woman adds another layer, as their identity might not align with the shop's policy, leading to accusations of transphobia.\n\nIn conclusion, while the manager's intention was to uphold religious practices and business policies, the enforcement could be seen as discriminatory, especially if the customer was denied service due to their gender identity. So the answer might lean towards the manager being in the wrong (A), but there's a counterargument if the policy is clearly stated and followed.\n"
