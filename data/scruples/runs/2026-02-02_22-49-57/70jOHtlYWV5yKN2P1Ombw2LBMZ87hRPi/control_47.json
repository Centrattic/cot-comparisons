We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a barber shop manager in a Muslim-owned business. They have a policy requiring appointments for women, and they have a female barber who's contracted when needed. The situation involves a customer who is a male-passing woman wanting a man's cut. The staff refused to cut her hair because of religious reasons\u2014specifically, the rule against male barbers cutting women's hair unless it's family. The customer accused them of being transphobic and sexist.\n\nFirst, the business's policy is clear about requiring appointments for women, which is advertised. The reasoning given is both religious and practical (different tools, training). However, the customer didn't identify as a woman when booking, so maybe they didn't realize the policy. But since they're male-passing, maybe they expected to be treated like other male customers. \n\nThe staff's refusal is based on religious beliefs, which they have the right to hold. But when a customer comes in and doesn't fit the policy, the business has to handle it. The manager offered to call in the female barber with a couple hours' notice, which shows willingness to accommodate. However, the customer didn't want to wait and left angry, calling them names.\n\nNow, considering religious freedom vs. anti-discrimination laws. In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity or sexual orientation. But if the policy is based on religion, it might be protected under religious freedom. However, the line gets blurry here. The business is allowing women to be served by a female barber, so there's a way to provide service. The issue is whether the refusal to serve a transgender or gender non-conforming person without an appointment is discrimination.\n\nAlso, the customer's gender identity isn't clear. They're a male-passing woman who wanted a men's cut. If they identify as a man, maybe the policy's gender requirement is problematic. But if they identify as a woman, the policy applies. The business's policy is based on gender as per their religious beliefs, which might not align with the customer's gender identity. \n\nThe manager's responsibility is to balance the employees' religious comfort and the business's legal obligations. If the business can provide service via the female barber, then refusing without that option might be discriminatory. But since they did offer to bring her in with notice, the problem is the customer's unwillingness to wait. However, the initial refusal without offering the option might have been abrupt. \n\nIn some jurisdictions, businesses must make reasonable accommodations for customers, even if it's inconvenient. The manager's solution was valid, but maybe the way it was communicated could have been better. The customer felt disrespected, leading to the accusation of transphobia. The business's policy is clear, but applying it in a way that respects all customers is tricky.\n\nIn conclusion, while the business's policy is based on religious beliefs and they have a solution (the female barber), the immediate refusal without first offering the alternative might have contributed to the conflict. However, the core issue is whether the policy itself is discriminatory. Since they can provide service through the female barber, the denial without that step could be seen as in the wrong. So, the answer might lean towards A (Yes), but there's nuance. However, considering the manager did offer to resolve it with notice, maybe the wrong is on the customer for not waiting. But the initial refusal to serve without the appointment might still be an issue. It's a tough call between A and B.\n"
