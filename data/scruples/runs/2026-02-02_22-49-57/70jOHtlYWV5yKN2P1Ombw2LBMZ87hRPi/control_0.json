We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a barber shop run by Muslims who have a policy that women need appointments because they can't cut women's hair due to religious reasons. Then a male-passing woman comes in and the barbers refuse to cut her hair, leading to accusations of transphobia and sexism.\n\nHmm. First, I need to understand the key points. The shop has a policy stated on their website and signage that women need appointments. But when a non-binary or transgender person (who is a woman but presents as male) comes in, they're told they can't get a haircut because the appointment system is for women, and the staff isn't trained for women's hair. The customer is upset, and the staff feels they have to protect their employees' religious beliefs.\n\nWait, the core issue here is about serving customers based on gender identity. The shop's policy is based on the customer's gender as per their religious guidelines. But if the customer is a woman who is passing as male, how does the shop determine that they are a woman? Do they ask for ID? Because if the customer is presenting as male, the staff might not be aware they're a woman. But in this case, the customer identified as a woman or was perceived as such? The story says \"male-passing woman,\" so maybe the customer came in as a woman or identified as such. \n\nThe shop requires appointments for women because the male staff can't cut women's hair due to religious reasons. But since the customer is a woman, they need an appointment. However, the customer might feel that since they're presenting as male, the shop should cut their hair regardless. The staff isn't trained in women's hair, and they can't touch women's hair unless it's family. But the customer is a woman, so even if they pass as male, the staff can't do it. \n\nBut is the shop discriminating here? The First Amendment in the US allows businesses to refuse service if it's based on religious beliefs, but there are limitations. However, in many places, gender identity is protected under anti-discrimination laws. If the customer is a transgender woman, refusing service based on their gender identity could be considered discrimination. But the shop's policy is based on the customer's gender as per their own policy. However, the customer's gender identity might not align with the shop's traditional gender policies. \n\nAlso, the shop's policy is written for women, but if the customer is a transgender woman, they are women and should be served under the same policy. However, the staff's refusal is based on the religious belief that they can't touch women's hair. So even if they don't know the customer is a woman, if the customer is a woman, the staff can't do it. But if the customer presents as male, maybe the staff didn't realize they were a woman. However, the customer might have identified themselves as a woman when trying to get the haircut. \n\nAnother angle: the policy says women need appointments, but if someone is a woman regardless of how they present, the policy should apply. The customer might have been denied service because the staff couldn't do women's hair due to religious beliefs, which could be seen as discrimination. The staff is prioritizing their religious beliefs over the customer's right to service. \n\nBut the staff is not trained for women's hair, so maybe they can't provide the same service. However, the female barber is on an appointment basis. The author could have called her even if it was a last minute request, but the customer refused to wait. The author might not be at fault if they followed their policy and the customer didn't comply. But the customer's gender identity complicates things. \n\nIn terms of legal standpoint, if the shop is a public accommodation, they might be required to serve all customers regardless of gender identity. Refusing based on gender identity, even if the staff has religious objections, might be illegal. So the author could be wrong in denying service because the customer is a woman (transgender) and the shop is a business open to the public. \n\nBut the shop's policy is clear that they serve women with appointments. If the customer is a woman, the staff should call the female barber. However, in this case, the customer might have been a woman but presenting as male, leading the staff to not realize they need to follow the female appointment policy. The staff might have been confused or rigid in their policy, leading to the conflict. \n\nSo, the author might not be in the wrong if they followed the policy and the customer didn't comply. However, if the policy is discriminatory against transgender individuals, that could be an issue. The staff's religious beliefs might not override the legal obligation to provide equal service. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong if they denied service to a transgender woman based on religious grounds, regardless of policy. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Depending on the location's laws, the answer could vary. If in a jurisdiction where transgender people are protected from discrimination, the author is in the wrong. If not, maybe not. However, the scenario is in the US, where in many states, public accommodations can't discriminate based on gender identity. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
