We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a barber shop manager who's Muslim, and they had a situation where a male-passing woman came in for a haircut. The shop has a policy that requires appointments for women because the male barbers aren't trained or comfortable cutting women's hair due to religious beliefs. The customer was upset, called them transphobic, etc., and left in anger.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity or expression. However, the shop's policy is about the type of service (men vs. women) and the availability of trained staff. They mention they have a female barber available by appointment. So the issue here is whether the policy is lawful and not discriminatory.\n\nThe shop's signage and online presence clearly state that they serve men primarily, with women by appointment. That transparency is important. The customer might not have booked an appointment because they identify as male-passing, but the policy is based on gender, which could be problematic if it's seen as excluding transgender or non-binary individuals. However, the shop's policy is based on the staff's training and comfort, not the customer's gender identity per se. They mention that the male barbers aren't trained in women's haircuts due to religious reasons, which is a key point.\n\nReligious exemptions can sometimes be a factor in employment or service provision, but they might not override anti-discrimination laws. However, the shop isn't refusing service based on gender; they have a system in place for women to get appointments, which includes the female barber. The problem here is whether the customer's gender presentation (male-passing) was the issue. If the customer identified as a woman, they should have been directed to the appointment system. But since they presented as male, the barbers might have been under the impression they were a regular male customer. The confusion arises from the customer's gender presentation versus their actual gender for the appointment system.\n\nThe shop's policy is about the type of service (men's vs. women's haircuts) and the tools/products needed. The barbers aren't trained for women's hair, so they require an appointment to bring in the female barber. The customer might have expected a male barber to do a men's style cut, but the shop's policy is based on the hair type, not the customer's gender identity. However, this could still be seen as discriminatory if the policy doesn't apply consistently or if it's based on the customer's gender rather than the type of service needed.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the shop is prioritizing the comfort and training of their employees, which is understandable. But denying service to someone who identifies as male-passing might be seen as transphobic, especially if the shop's policy is based on the customer's perceived gender rather than the actual service requirements. However, the shop's transparency in their policies might mitigate some of that, as they clearly state who they serve best.\n\nThe key here is whether the shop can enforce a policy that requires appointments for women without violating anti-discrimination laws. Since they have a system in place to accommodate women through their female barber, the policy might be legal. However, the situation with a male-passing woman complicates things because the customer's gender presentation might have led to confusion. If the shop had a policy based on the type of service (e.g., different hair types) rather than gender, that might be more defensible. But since the policy is gender-based, it could be problematic.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be in the wrong from a legal standpoint if the policy is transparent and there's an alternative available (the female barber by appointment). However, ethically, there's a risk of appearing discriminatory, especially if the customer felt targeted due to their gender identity. The author's intention was to provide service within the shop's capabilities and respect employees' beliefs, which is valid, but the execution might have failed to consider the customer's perspective and potential discrimination issues.\n"

  "full_response": "A\n\nThe author is in the wrong. While the shop's policy may be based on religious beliefs and service capabilities, the refusal to accommodate a customer who identifies as male-passing (regardless of gender presentation) could be seen as discriminatory. Anti-discrimination laws often protect against gender identity and expression, and the shop's policy\u2014focused on gender rather than actual service needs\u2014may not hold up under scrutiny. Additionally, the lack of flexibility in addressing the customer's specific request (e.g., clarifying their needs or offering solutions) contributes to the perception of transphobia or sexism.",
