We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the manager of a barbershop is at fault for not cutting a customer's hair because the customer was a male-passing woman and the shop's policy requires appointments for women. The shop has a religious policy where male employees can't touch women's hair except for family, and they don't train in women's haircuts. The customer claimed the manager was transphobic, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity or sex. Refusing service because someone is a woman or transgender could be illegal. The shop's policy might be based on religious beliefs, but anti-discrimination laws might override that. The manager mentioned they have a female barber available by appointment, but the customer didn't want an appointment and insisted on a men's cut. The shop's policy is to require appointments for women, which might not account for non-binary or transgender individuals. \n\nAlso, the shop's policy is stated on their website and signs, so maybe the customer should have known. But the customer identified as male-passing, so maybe they didn't realize they were considered a \"woman\" under the shop's policy. There's a conflict between the shop's religious practices and the customer's rights. \n\nIn some jurisdictions, religious exemptions might apply, but others prioritize anti-discrimination laws. The manager might not be in the wrong if the policy is clearly stated, but if the customer wasn't aware or if the policy discriminates against protected classes, the manager could be at fault. Also, the term \"transphobic\" is thrown around, but the shop's policy may not be targeting trans people specifically. It's more about the gender of the barber and the customer, which could still be discriminatory.\n\nI think the key points are: legality of the policy, clarity of the policy, and whether the customer was aware. If the policy is against the law, the manager is in the wrong. If it's legal, then maybe not. But in many areas, refusing service based on gender identity is prohibited. So the answer might be A (the manager is wrong) because the policy could be discriminatory despite their religious beliefs.\n"
