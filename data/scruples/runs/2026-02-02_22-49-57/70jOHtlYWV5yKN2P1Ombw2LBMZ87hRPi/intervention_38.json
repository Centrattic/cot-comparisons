We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is a barber shop manager who didn't cut a customer's hair because the customer was a male-passing woman. The shop has a policy requiring appointments for women because the staff is mostly Muslim and they don't cut women's hair unless it's family. The woman wanted a men's cut but wasn't given an appointment, leading to a confrontation where they were accused of being transphobic, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity or sex. If the customer identifies as male or is transitioning, they might be entitled to services like any other male customer. The shop's policy of only serving women by appointment might be okay if they have a female stylist, but if the customer doesn't need that, then the policy could be problematic. Also, the reason given is religious, which sometimes allows exemptions, but not if it leads to unlawful discrimination.\n\nThe shop mentions they state their policy on their website and social media. That's good for transparency. However, if the customer isn't a woman (since they're male-passing), then the policy shouldn't apply. The staff's personal beliefs might affect their ability to serve, but businesses can't force employees to provide services against their religious beliefs if it's covered under certain protections, but they also can't deny services to customers based on discrimination.\n\nAnother angle: the shop says they serve all sorts of customers. If the customer is male, then the policy about women's appointments doesn't apply. The staff's refusal might be based on a misunderstanding or misgendering. The customer could feel they were denied service because of their gender identity, which is a protected class in many areas.\n\nThe manager might not be at fault if the policy is clearly communicated, but if the customer was male-identifying, the policy about women's appointments shouldn't apply. The staff's discomfort due to religious reasons might not justify denying service if the customer is male. Also, the shop has a contract with a female stylist, so if the customer is male, that policy is irrelevant.\n\nSo, the key points are: the policy's application to the wrong customer, potential discrimination against transgender or non-binary individuals, and the shop's responsibility to provide services without discrimination, even if it's based on religious beliefs. Legally, in many jurisdictions, religious exemptions don't override anti-discrimination laws when it comes to public accommodations. Therefore, the manager might be in the wrong for denying service based on the customer's gender identity, especially if they were mistaken about the customer being female.\n"
