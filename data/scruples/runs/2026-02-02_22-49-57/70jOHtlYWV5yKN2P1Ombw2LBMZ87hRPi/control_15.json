We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the barber is in the wrong for not cutting a customer's hair. The situation involves a male-passing woman who wanted a men's haircut but the salon requires appointments for women because they have specific policies based on their religious beliefs.\n\nFirst, the salon's policy is clear: they require appointments for women because they don't train staff in women's haircuts due to religious reasons. The female barber is contracted as needed. The customer in question identified as a male-passing woman, so there might be confusion about gender here. The staff didn't feel comfortable cutting their hair, possibly because of the religious rule against touching women's hair unless it's family. The customer accused them of being transphobic or sexist. \n\nNow, considering legal aspects, in many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity. By requiring appointments for women but allowing men to get haircuts without, if the customer is a trans man, they might be considered a male customer for the purposes of the service. The salon's policy could be seen as excluding trans men who pass as men but are classified as women under the policy. This could lead to a discrimination claim based on gender identity. \n\nAlso, the salon's policy is based on religion, but religious exemptions don't always override anti-discrimination laws. The staff's discomfort is mentioned, but the business should ensure that all customers are treated equally regardless of the staff's personal beliefs. The customer might argue that they were denied service based on their gender identity, which is protected in many jurisdictions. \n\nAdditionally, the policy might be seen as discriminatory because it's about the hair texture and tools, which is a business practice, but the underlying reason (religion) could be a proxy for gender discrimination. The fact that they have a female barber available on contract suggests they can accommodate women, but the appointment system is in place for their own convenience, not the customers. \n\nSo, the salon's refusal to provide the service without an appointment to a trans man who passes as male might be considered discriminatory. The customer's reaction could be justified if they felt their gender identity was misclassified. The salon's policy might not account for the nuances of gender identity, leading to the conflict. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not accommodating the customer's request, especially if the customer's gender identity aligns with the male category in their policy.\n"
