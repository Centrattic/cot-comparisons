We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is a manager at a barbershop that's primarily for men. They have a female barber on contract for women's appointments. The question is whether it's their fault for not cutting a customer's hair, who identified as male-passing but the staff considered them a woman.\n\nFirst, the barbershop has clear policies stating they need appointments for women because of religious reasons. They mention that Muslim staff aren't supposed to touch women's hair unless it's family, which is why they have the female barber. The customer argued they wanted a men's cut, but the staff wasn't comfortable. The customer then accused the shop of being transphobic and sexist.\n\nI need to consider a few angles. Legally, in many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity. However, religious exemptions might allow certain practices. But there's a line between policy and discrimination. The shop claims they have a female barber available, but if the customer wasn't booked in advance, they couldn't be served. But if the customer is male-passing, does the shop have the right to deny them based on perceived gender? \n\nReligious accommodations are tricky. If the policy is strictly based on gender, not gender expression or identity, then it might not align with current anti-discrimination laws. For example, in some areas, refusing service to a transgender person based on religious beliefs could be considered discrimination. The shop's policy might not account for gender non-conforming individuals.\n\nAlso, the customer's claim that they wanted a men's cut suggests they don't require the services of a female barber. If the shop's policy is rigid and doesn't allow for exceptions, they might be failing to accommodate. The staff's discomfort is their own issue, but the business is responsible for providing service as per the law.\n\nAnother point: the shop's policy is stated on their website and signage, which is good for transparency. However, if a customer doesn't fit neatly into the categories presented (male or female), the policy might not cover them. The customer might not have known they needed an appointment because their gender identity is fluid.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the shop is prioritizing their religious beliefs and employees' comfort, which is their right. But if that leads to denying service to someone who doesn't fit the traditional binary, it could be seen as discriminatory. The customer might feel they were treated unfairly based on their gender expression, which is a protected class in many jurisdictions.\n\nSo, the author's position is that they followed the policy, but the policy itself might be problematic. They might not be in the wrong in their own perspective, but legally or ethically, there could be issues. It's a balance between religious freedom and anti-discrimination laws. In some places, religious exemptions might not cover this scenario, so the author could be in the wrong.\n"
