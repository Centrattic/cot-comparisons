We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is a barber and manager who refused to cut a male-passing woman's hair because they have a policy requiring appointments for women, and their employees are Muslim with a rule about not touching women's hair unless it's family. The customer got upset, called them transphobic, etc. The user thinks they're not wrong, but wants to know if they are.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The business has a stated policy that appointments are needed for women. The reason given is religious, as their employees are Muslim and have a rule against cutting women's hair. However, they have a female barber who can handle those appointments. The customer in question was a male-passing woman, so maybe they didn't want to go through an appointment because they felt it was a men's service. The barber tried to explain that the policy is in place for the employees' comfort and service quality (different tools, products, etc.), but the customer was upset.\n\nNow, the key points here are: the business has a clear policy, which they advertised. The policy is based on religious beliefs of the employees, and they make exceptions by having a contracted female barber. The customer was informed of the policy, but didn't want to comply, leading to a conflict.\n\nIs the barber in the wrong? Well, they followed their own policy, which is important for business operations and employee comfort. The policy is stated publicly, so the customer had prior knowledge. However, the customer felt discriminated against, possibly because they were trans or non-binary. The business might be seen as enforcing a policy that could be perceived as discriminatory, even if the intention is based on religion.\n\nBut in some jurisdictions, religious accommodations are allowed as a defense against discrimination claims. However, if the policy disproportionately affects a protected group (like gender identity), there might be legal or ethical issues. But the business is trying to provide the service via the female barber, so they aren't completely denying service. It's about the method of service, not the service itself.\n\nOn the other hand, the customer might argue that the policy is transphobic if they were male-passing and wanted a standard men's cut, which the business refused. The business could claim it's a religious practice and that they still offer service through the female barber. But maybe the policy is not accommodating transgender individuals, even if unintentionally.\n\nIt's a tricky situation. The author may not be in the wrong if the policy is clearly stated and they have a way to provide the service (via the female barber), but there's a risk of appearing discriminatory. However, if the policy is genuinely based on religion and they make accommodations by having a female barber available, then legally they might be in the right. Ethically, it's more nuanced because it could be seen as excluding transgender individuals. But since the business is transparent about their policy, they might not be at fault.\n"
