We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that a barber (the author) refused to cut a customer's hair because the customer is a male-passing woman. The barbershop has a policy requiring appointments for women because they don't have women's hair training and religious reasons.\n\nFirst, the customer's identity is a bit tricky. They identify as a male-passing woman, so they might not be trans, but they're not a man either. The shop's policy says they need appointments for women, and they can't cut women's hair due to religious beliefs. The customer argued they wanted a men's cut, but the author explains that the policy isn't about the customer's gender but about the staff's training and religious practices.\n\nThe key points are: the shop's policy is clear and communicated publicly. They contract a female barber for appointments. The staff's discomfort is due to both religious reasons and lack of training. The customer felt discriminated against as transphobic and sexist.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity. Even if the shop's policy is based on religion, it might still be considered discriminatory as they're not making accommodations for those who can't conform to the appointment policy. The author's reasoning might be based on their beliefs, but if the policy excludes people based on gender identity, it's problematic.\n\nHowever, the shop does have a way to accommodate (appointments for women), but the customer might not have an appointment. The issue here is whether the customer's gender identity (as male-passing but not a man) fits into the policy. If the shop considers the customer a man because they pass as male, then they might not need an appointment. But if the shop's policy is based on biological sex (which is what the religious rules might be referring to), then the customer is a woman and requires an appointment.\n\nThe customer probably felt wronged because they were denied service based on their gender identity, even though they pass as male. The author might not be in the wrong if the policy is based on biological sex and they have a system in place for women. However, if the policy is based on gender identity and not allowing trans people to be served without appointments, that's different. Also, the staff's discomfort due to religious beliefs might not be a valid reason to deny service in many jurisdictions.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong because they failed to accommodate the customer's needs despite having the means to (appointments), and their policy could be seen as discriminatory against gender-diverse individuals. Alternatively, if the policy is based on biological sex and the customer is a woman (biologically), then the policy is followed correctly. But the customer's identity as male-passing complicates that. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards the author being in the wrong due to potential discrimination against transgender or non-binary individuals.\n"
