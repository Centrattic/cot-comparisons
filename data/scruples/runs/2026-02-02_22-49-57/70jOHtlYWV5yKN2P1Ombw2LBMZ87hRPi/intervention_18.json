We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (a barber shop manager) is in the wrong for refusing to cut a male-passing woman's hair due to their religious policy and lack of training. The situation involves a customer who identified as a man but was a woman, and the shop has a policy that requires appointments for women because their male employees aren't trained in women's hair and have religious restrictions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, discrimination based on gender identity is illegal. Even if the shop has policies about women, if the customer identifies as a man, then the policy might not apply. The shop's policy states they require appointments for women, but if the customer is presenting as a male-passing woman, there's a conflict here. The customer might see it as discrimination because they identify as a man and are being treated as a woman. \n\nNext, the religious justification. The shop is primarily Muslim, and their employees have religious beliefs about not cutting women's hair unless it's family. However, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act allows religion as a defense, but it doesn't override anti-discrimination laws, especially regarding gender identity. There's a balance between religious freedom and anti-discrimination laws here. If the customer is transgender or non-binary, the shop might be violating anti-discrimination laws by refusing service based on gender identity, regardless of the employee's beliefs.\n\nAlso, the shop's policy mentions they serve all sorts of customers, but the signage and website specify appointments for women. That might not account for people who don't fit neatly into binary categories. The customer might feel they were discriminated against for being a woman or for their gender identity. \n\nThe employees' comfort is a factor, but the shop could have made an exception if the customer was willing to wait for the female barber. The manager mentions that the female barber is on contract, so they needed a couple of hours' notice. The customer didn't want to wait, leading to the conflict. The manager might not be in the wrong if they followed their policy, but if the policy itself is discriminatory, especially against transgender or non-binary individuals, that's a problem.\n\nAnother angle: the shop's policy is based on gender, but if the customer identifies as a man, the policy shouldn't apply. However, if the customer is a trans man, they might have a different experience. The shop's approach could be seen as misgendering or not respecting the customer's identity. \n\nIn terms of religious exemptions, some states allow businesses to refuse service based on religious beliefs, but others don't, especially when it comes to protected classes like gender identity. The manager might be in the wrong if their policy conflicts with local laws that protect against gender identity discrimination.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the manager's policy might be based on religious beliefs and operational practices, but if the customer is part of a protected class (gender identity), the shop could be violating anti-discrimination laws. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong. However, if the policy is clearly stated and the customer didn't follow the appointment system, the shop might have a case. But considering the customer's identity, the shop's policy might not be applicable, making the manager at fault.\n"
