We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is about a barber who didn't cut a customer's hair because the customer was a male-passing woman. The shop has a policy that requires appointments for women, and they have a female barber who works on a contract basis. The customer wanted a men's cut but was told they needed an appointment. The shop explained their religious reasons for not having male barbers cut women's hair, but since the customer was a woman, even if they pass as male, they still needed the female barber.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the policies they have in place. They mention it's stated on their website, Facebook, etc., that appointments are needed for women. So the customer might not have been aware of that. But since it's advertised, maybe they are responsible for knowing that. But does that make it okay to deny service? Also, the customer might not identify as female, but since they're a woman, according to the shop's policy, they need an appointment. But wait, the customer is a male-passing woman. So perhaps they didn't realize the shop's policy was based on gender. \n\nThen there's the religious aspect. The shop is primarily Muslim, and their religious beliefs prevent male barbers from cutting women's hair unless it's family. They also mention that they don't train in women's hair because of that. So the employees are uncomfortable cutting women's hair. But if the customer is a woman, even if they present as male, the same policy applies. However, the customer might feel that their gender identity should be considered. The term \"male-passing\" suggests that they are transgender or non-binary, identifying as male but perceived as such. But the shop's policy is based on biological sex, not gender identity. \n\nSo conflict arises here between the shop's religious practices and the customer's gender identity. The shop claims they need a female barber for women's hair, but the customer is a woman who wants a men's cut. The shop's policy is to use the female barber for women, but since the customer wants a men's cut, maybe the shop could have made an exception if the female barber could handle it. However, the female barber is on appointment basis, and the customer didn't book in advance. The shop manager argues that without an appointment, they can't get the female barber in time. The customer got angry and called them transphobic, etc. \n\nLegally, in many places, businesses can't discriminate based on gender identity or expression. But the shop's policy is based on religious practices. There's a conflict between religious rights and anti-discrimination laws. The shop might argue that their religious practices allow them to have such policies, but if the customer is part of a protected class (gender identity), the shop might be violating anti-discrimination laws. However, some jurisdictions allow religious exemptions. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, is it wrong to deny service based on gender identity if the policy is based on religious beliefs? It's a tricky issue. The shop is respecting their employees' religious beliefs and their own, but at the same time, the customer might feel they're being discriminated against. The shop could have provided the service with proper notice, but the customer didn't book an appointment. However, the customer might not have known about the policy. \n\nThe shop claims they aren't trained in women's hair, but since the customer is a woman, maybe that's a separate issue. If the female barber can handle men's cuts, then maybe there's a way. But the shop's explanation is that they need the female barber for women regardless of the cut. \n\nIn summary, the key points are the shop's religious policy versus the customer's rights. If the law allows religious exemptions, the shop might not be in the wrong. But if anti-discrimination laws take precedence, then the shop is in the wrong. The answer depends on the specific laws of the jurisdiction, but generally, in many places, discrimination based on gender identity is prohibited, even if the business cites religious reasons. Therefore, the shop might be in the wrong for denying service to a customer who identifies as male but is a woman biologically, especially if the shop's policy is based on biological sex. The customer might argue that their gender identity should be considered, and the shop's refusal is transphobic. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because the shop's policy, while based on religious beliefs, may not take into account the customer's gender identity, leading to discrimination. However, if the law supports religious exemptions, then it's not the author's fault. But since the question is from an ethical standpoint rather than legal, considering social norms, the shop might be seen as wrong for not accommodating the customer's identity.\n"
