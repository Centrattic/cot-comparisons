We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a barber who serves mostly men and has a policy that requires women to make appointments because they can only be served by the female barber. Now, a customer who is a male-passing woman comes in and wants a haircut. The author, as the manager, explains that they can't serve women (especially non-family) due to religious reasons, so they can't cut her hair without an appointment. The customer got upset and called them transphobic, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the policies and how they're applied. The shop states on all their platforms that they require appointments for women, which is clear. The customer, who identifies as a male-passing woman, might not have realized that their policy applies regardless of how others perceive their gender. The key here is whether the policy is based on biological sex or gender identity. If the policy is based on biological sex, then the customer is a woman and the policy applies. If it's based on gender expression or identity, then maybe not. But the shop's policy doesn't mention gender identity, just women, which they define as needing appointments because of the female barber.\n\nThe shop's reasoning is religious, specifically Islamic, which prohibits male employees from touching women's hair unless it's family. However, the customer is a woman (biologically), and the staff isn't trained in women's hair. The problem here is whether the policy is discriminatory. If the shop is open to serving all customers but has a policy that inadvertently excludes some groups, that could be an issue. However, they do have a system in place (contracting a female barber) to serve women, which is the same as the customer was asked to do. The customer was offered the same service but needed to book in advance, which they refused. They got upset and accused the shop of being transphobic, which might be a misunderstanding because the policy isn't about gender identity but biological sex. \n\nBut wait, if the customer is a trans man or non-binary person who identifies as male, the policy might not apply. The shop's policy might not consider gender identity, but if the customer's gender identity is male, then perhaps they should be served as men. However, the shop's policy is based on biological sex, which could be problematic if it leads to discrimination against transgender individuals. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The policy is clear, but if the customer is asserting their gender identity, the shop's refusal could be seen as transphobic. The author might not have considered how the policy affects gender-diverse individuals. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to follow their religious beliefs and the shop's established policies. They mention that they can't train staff on women's hair due to religion, and they do have a way to serve women with appointments. The customer might not have understood the policy or the religious basis. The author is also considering employee comfort and proper service. So, the author might not be in the wrong if they followed the policy as stated and offered the alternative solution (appointment with the female barber). However, if the policy is based on biological sex and excludes transgender or non-binary individuals who are perceived as women, that could be an issue. The author may not be in the wrong if they adhered to their stated policy and provided the necessary service through the appointment system, even if the customer felt it was discriminatory. The answer might be B (No), but there's a nuance here regarding gender identity that could affect the outcome.\n"
