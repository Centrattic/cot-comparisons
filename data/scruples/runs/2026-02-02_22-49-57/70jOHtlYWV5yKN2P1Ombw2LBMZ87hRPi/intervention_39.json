We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the barber (the author) was in the wrong for not cutting a customer's hair. Let me go through the details provided.\n\nThe barbershop is primarily Muslim, with most employees being Muslim. They have a policy that requires appointments for women because they only have a female barber available on an appointment basis. The customer in question is described as male-passing but is a woman. The customer wanted a men's style cut, but the barbers didn't feel comfortable doing it because of the religious rule about not touching women's hair unless it's family. The staff isn't trained in women's haircuts due to their religion, and they have a policy to require appointments for women to ensure they can be served properly.\n\nSo, the author didn't cut the customer's hair because of the policy and the employees' comfort levels based on their religious beliefs. The customer felt targeted and accused them of transphobia, sexism, etc., and left in anger.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let me consider both sides.\n\nFirst, the barbershop's policy is clear: they require appointments for women. The customer might not have known this or might not have followed the appointment system. If the customer didn't book an appointment, the barbershop is within their right to follow their policy. However, the customer identified as male-passing but is a woman. The barbershop's religious rules prevent them from cutting women's hair, even if the customer is presenting as male. So there's a conflict here between the customer's gender identity and the barbershop's religious policies.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author isn't in the wrong. I need to check if that's valid. The key factors are the policy, the staff's training, and the religious beliefs. The barbershop is transparent about their services\u2014stating they mainly serve men and require appointments for women. If they made that clear, then the customer might have had the opportunity to book an appointment. However, the customer might have believed that because they are male-passing, they should be treated as a man and not require the appointment. The barbershop didn't make a distinction based on the customer's gender identity, which could be problematic. But they also have a right to operate under their religious beliefs, which prohibit cutting women's hair unless it's family. \n\nThere's a potential issue with discrimination here. While the barbershop's policies are based on religious beliefs, they might inadvertently exclude transgender or non-binary individuals who are recognized as women by the business. However, the barbershop is clear about their services, so they might not be obligated to change their policy. At the same time, refusing service based on gender identity could be seen as discriminatory, depending on local laws and the specific circumstances.\n\nIn some places, businesses can have religious exemptions that protect them from discrimination claims. However, if the barbershop is refusing service based on the customer's gender identity, that could cross a line. The author is caught between their religious practices and potential discrimination. The fact that they had a female employee available for appointments shows they do provide that service, but the customer might not have wanted to wait or might not have known.\n\nAnother point is that the barbershop's staff isn't trained in women's haircuts due to religious reasons. If the customer is considered a woman by the barbershop's standards, then their refusal is based on that, even if the customer feels they should be treated as a man. The barbershop's policy is clear, but the customer may not have adhered to it, leading to conflict.\n\nIn terms of the author's responsibility, they followed the policy and considered the comfort of their employees. However, if the policy is not inclusive of gender identities beyond the binary, that could be an issue. The author might not be in the wrong for following their stated policy, but they could be seen as in the wrong if the policy doesn't account for gender identity. The conflict here is between religious practices and the customer's gender identity.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the barbershop's policy is inclusive enough. Since they clearly state they serve men and require appointments for women, and the customer is a woman (as per their own policy), the author isn't in the wrong for following the policy. The customer might have misunderstood or not followed the appointment system. However, if the customer identifies as male, but the barbershop's policy is based on biological sex, that's another angle. But the customer's situation is that they're male-passing but are a woman, so the barbershop's policy might not account for that. It's a bit of a grey area.\n\nGiven that the barbershop is transparent about their services and the customer didn't book an appointment, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They had a policy in place and followed it. The employees' comfort and training are also valid considerations. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
