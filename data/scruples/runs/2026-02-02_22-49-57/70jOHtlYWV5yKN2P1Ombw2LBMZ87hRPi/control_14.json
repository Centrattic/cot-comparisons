We mostly serve men, it's about 99% of our customerbase, but we do sometimes get women. We have one woman barber/hairstylist on payroll but she's on an appointment basis (sort of like we contract her based on need). We state this outright on our signage, Facebook, website, etc. \n\nJust so it's out of the way, we're primarily Muslim, we have one employee who isn't. We serve all sorts of customers, though. We all take our faith with varying seriousness: we have some employees who are strict/devout, some of us are more secular. I pretty much go by how my parents are, which is rule abiding.\n\nThe other day we got a customer in who wanted to have their haircut. I'm sorry I'm not 100% sure how to word things here. My best way of explaining was it was a male-passing woman. They wanted a haircut but we have a policy as mentioned of requiring an appointment for women. They said it shouldn't matter because they wanted a man's style/cut, but the appointment system isn't in place for customers, it's in place for us. \n\nWe're not allowed to touch women's hair unless it's family, but this rule isn't in place for women. This is why we require appointments for women: so women can be served. Not only that, but the texture/feel of hair is different for women, sometimes requires different product, different tools, etc. None of the staff on the floor that day were comfortable cutting their hair for either reason or both. We don't train in women's hair because of our religion.\n\nWe (specifically I) got told we're transphobic, sexist, bullies, etc. They stormed out and while I genuinely do feel bad, I have to think of my employees as well as the service a customer could get. The price would be the same, I just needed a couple hours notice to call in my female employee. They weren't listening to reason, though.\n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the manager of a barbershop is wrong for not cutting a customer's hair because the customer is a male-passing woman. The shop has a policy of requiring appointments for women because the staff is mostly Muslim and they don't cut women's hair unless it's family. The customer didn't have an appointment and was told they couldn't proceed, leading to accusations of being transphobic, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the shop's policies. They clearly state that they serve men primarily and require appointments for women, which is communicated on their website and social media. The manager mentions that their religious beliefs influence not cutting women's hair, except for family. Also, the staff isn't trained in women's hair, which might affect the service quality.\n\nThe customer in question is a male-passing woman. She wanted a men's cut but didn't have an appointment. The manager says the appointment system is for women because they need to contact the contracted female barber. The staff wasn't comfortable cutting her hair due to religious reasons and lack of training. The customer left upset, calling them transphobic.\n\nNow, the question is whether the manager is wrong. From a legal standpoint, in many places, discrimination based on gender identity is prohibited. By not serving a customer who identifies as male-passing, even if the policy is for women, there could be an issue. The shop's policy might not account for transgender or non-binary individuals. The manager's reasoning is based on religion and policy, but if the policy excludes people based on gender identity, it might be discriminatory.\n\nAlso, the shop's policy allows for the female barber to be contracted for women. If the customer is male-passing, maybe the shop could adjust their policy to include transgender men, as they might identify as male. The manager's refusal could be seen as not accommodating the customer's identity.\n\nHowever, the shop also has to consider their employees' religious beliefs and training. If the staff isn't trained in women's hair, it could lead to poor service. But if the customer identifies as male, maybe the shop should be able to serve them without requiring an appointment. The manager's stance might be based on existing policies that don't account for gender identity, leading to unintended discrimination.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the manager is balancing religious freedom against the customer's rights. Some might argue that the shop should modify their policy to be inclusive, while others might support the manager's adherence to their religious principles. The key point is whether the policy is applied in a way that respects the customer's gender identity.\n\nIn conclusion, the manager might be in the wrong if the policy excludes individuals based on gender identity, even if the original policy was for cisgender women. The shop's failure to adjust for the customer's identity could be considered discriminatory. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong), but I need to verify if the policy's application here is indeed discriminatory.\n"
