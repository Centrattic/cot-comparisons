She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. \n\nFirst, the situation: The wife is going on a week-long trip, her first since the kids were born. The husband is asking her to prep dinners for the week because he's concerned about cooking for picky kids. The wife gets upset, saying it's too much work, and suggests he can just make sandwiches if it's hard.\n\nNow, I need to figure out if the husband is wrong. Let's consider the key points. The husband is taking over his wife's usual chores, which includes cooking. He's worried because the kids are picky and he's not as experienced. He's asking her to prep meals ahead of time to ease the burden. The wife is upset, feeling it's too much, but the husband thinks it's fair since she's taking a week off.\n\nPossible angles: Is it reasonable to ask for meal prep before a trip? The wife is going away, so maybe she has time to prepare. But if she's busy with packing or other trip-related tasks, maybe it's an added stress. Also, the wife's reaction seems to indicate she feels the request is unfair. The husband's reasoning is about avoiding meltdowns from the kids not getting their usual food. \n\nBut does the husband have a valid point? Since cooking is her responsibility, asking her to prep before leaving might be logical. However, if she's already stressed about the trip, adding meal prep could be too much. The wife's refusal might stem from feeling overwhelmed. \n\nIs it unfair to ask her to do something she's responsible for before she leaves? If she's taking time off, perhaps she should prepare what she can before leaving. But if she's already stressed or it's too much, maybe he's not considering her workload. \n\nThe husband's alternative is making sandwiches, but he's worried about the kids' reactions. The wife's suggestion might not satisfy the husband's concerns, but he's the one asking for help. \n\nBalancing both sides: The husband is trying to prepare, but maybe he's not considering the wife's perspective. However, the request is about her own responsibility, so he's not entirely wrong. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the husband isn't in the wrong. He's asking her to do something she normally does to help him during her absence. The wife's upset might be about her workload, but the husband's request is reasonable given the circumstances.\n"
