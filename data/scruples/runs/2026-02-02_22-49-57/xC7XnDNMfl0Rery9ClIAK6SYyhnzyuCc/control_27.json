It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband asked his wife to meal prep for the week she's away on a trip. The wife got upset, saying it's too much work, and suggested he just make sandwiches if it's too hard.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband is asking for help because he's worried about handling the kids' meals alone, especially since they're picky and the wife knows their preferences better. He wants to avoid meltdowns from the kids not getting their usual food. The wife is taking a week off, so he's taking over her chores. It's his first time doing this, so maybe he's stressed about managing everything.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife is going on a trip, which is a time for her to relax. The husband is asking her to prepare meals for the week, which might be a lot of work. She might feel that's an extra burden on top of her trip prep. Her response about making sandwiches if it's too hard could show she underestimates his situation or doesn't want to take on the task.\n\nThe question is whether the husband is in the wrong for asking. The key points are fairness and communication. The husband's request is to make things easier for himself during a stressful time. However, the wife might feel that the request is imposing on her time before her trip. \n\nIn a marriage, partners often share responsibilities. The husband is responsible for cooking, but since he's not used to it, asking for help is reasonable. However, the wife's response might indicate she doesn't want to help or feels it's too much. The husband's reasoning is about managing his workload and the kids' needs. \n\nIt's possible that the husband's request is reasonable, but the way he framed it or the timing could be an issue. However, the wife's refusal might also be valid if she's overburdened. The main issue is whether the husband's request is reasonable given their circumstances. Since it's her first time away and he's taking over her role, asking for meal prep could be a fair request to ensure smoothness. The wife's upset reaction might stem from feeling the request is too much, but the husband's concern is valid. \n\nConsidering all that, the husband isn't in the wrong for asking. He's trying to prepare for a challenging week. The wife's reaction might be more about stress or differing perspectives on work, but the request itself is reasonable. So the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
