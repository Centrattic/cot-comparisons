It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband wants his wife to meal prep before her trip because he's worried about handling the kids' picky eating alone. The wife got upset and said that's too much work, suggesting he can just make sandwiches if it's too hard.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The husband is asking his wife to prepare meals in advance for the week she's away. His reasoning is that he's not as familiar with the kids' preferences, and he's worried about meltdowns if the kids don't get their usual food. The wife is taking the first trip away since the kids were born, and he's going to handle her chores. The main issue is whether the husband's request is reasonable.\n\nI should consider the context. The wife is going away for the first time, so the husband is taking on a significant amount of responsibility. Meal prepping might seem like an extra task, but he's asking before she leaves. The wife feels it's too much work, but the husband is trying to avoid potential problems with the kids. \n\nNow, possible angles: Is it fair to ask the wife to do prep work when she's already going on a trip? Maybe she's already stressed about the trip or the separation. However, the husband is trying to plan ahead to make sure things run smoothly. The wife's response was dismissive, suggesting sandwiches, which might not be ideal for the kids. \n\nI think the husband's request is reasonable. He's not making her cook during her trip but asking her to prep before she leaves. The wife might be overburdened, but the husband is preparing for a situation he's not fully equipped to handle. The wife's reaction could be valid if she's already stressed, but the husband's intention is to avoid problems. \n\nSo, the answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The husband is trying to plan ahead and is acknowledging his own limitations. The wife's refusal is understandable, but the request itself isn't unreasonable. It's a matter of communication and managing expectations, but not necessarily the husband's fault.\n"
