On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the husband is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. Let's consider the situation.\n\nFirst, the wife is going on a week-long trip. It's her first time away from the kids since they were born, so the husband is taking over all her responsibilities. He's working and managing chores, which is a lot. The main issue is cooking. The wife usually does the cooking, and she knows the kids' preferences better. The husband isn't against doing it himself but is worried about the kids' meltdowns if the food isn't right. He asked her to prep meals, but she got upset, thinking it's too much work.\n\nNow, the husband's reasoning is that since she's going away, it's reasonable to ask her to help out before leaving. He wants to make sure the kids eat well and to avoid stress. The wife's reaction is that it's too much work, and he can just make sandwiches. \n\nIs the husband in the wrong? Well, he's trying to manage a big workload and is asking for help. Meal prepping could save him time and reduce stress. The wife's refusal might be valid if she's already stressed or if the request is unrealistic. But the husband's request seems reasonable. He's not asking for something impossible, just prepping meals. It's a common practice for people to meal prep before leaving. The wife's response might be dismissive, suggesting sandwiches as a last resort, which could be seen as not supporting his needs. \n\nHowever, the key point is whether the husband's request is unfair. Since he's taking on her responsibilities, it's logical to ask her to assist in an area where she's more skilled. The husband isn't forcing her; he's making a request. The wife's reaction might stem from feeling overwhelmed, but the husband isn't wrong for wanting the help. \n\nSo, based on this analysis, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The husband's request is reasonable given the circumstances.\n"
