It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. He's taking over her chores and cooking, which is usually her responsibility. The kids are picky, and he's concerned about handling meals without her. He asked her to prep the dinners, but she got upset, saying it's too much work and suggested he just make sandwiches.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are about expectations and communication. The husband is trying to plan ahead to manage the workload, especially since it's his first time alone with the kids. The wife might feel that the request is adding to her already busy schedule before her trip. But is he in the wrong for asking?\n\nFirst, meal prepping can be time-consuming, and if she's already preparing for her trip, he might be adding extra work. However, he's also trying to set himself up for success by having meals ready. On the other hand, maybe she feels that once she's gone, he should handle it on his own, even if it's challenging. It's a balance between support and independence.\n\nI think the husband's intention is reasonable. He's not asking her to do something unreasonable; he just wants to make sure the kids have meals they like. However, his wife's reaction suggests that she might feel overburdened or that the request isn't fair given her own prep work. But is the husband wrong for making the request? Probably not. He's asking for help in a way that makes sense for their situation. The issue might be more about communication or the wife's capacity to take on more at that time. So the answer is B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
