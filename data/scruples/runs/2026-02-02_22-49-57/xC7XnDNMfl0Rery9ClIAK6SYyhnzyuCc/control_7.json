It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is at fault for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going away for a week, and the husband is concerned about handling the kids' meals, which are picky. He asked her to prep dinners, but she got upset and refused, thinking it's too much work. He feels it's reasonable since she's the one cooking normally and knows the kids' preferences.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the dynamics here. The husband is taking over her chores, so asking her to prep might seem logical. But the wife is already going to be away, so maybe she's already stressed about the trip. If she's upset, maybe she feels it's an additional burden. But the husband's reasoning is that he's not as familiar with the kids' food, so prepping would prevent meltdowns. \n\nIs he wrong? Well, he's trying to make things manageable. But maybe he didn't consider her workload before the trip. If she's preparing to leave, adding meal prep might be too much. The key here is communication. Did he consider her perspective? If he asked, but she felt it was too much, he should respect her feelings. Maybe there's a compromise. However, the husband's intention is to avoid problems when she's away. \n\nThe question is whether his request is unfair. Since he's taking over her responsibilities, it's reasonable to ask for help in that transition. But the wife might have valid reasons for not being able to prep. Maybe the trip is short notice, or she's already busy packing. The answer depends on mutual understanding. The husband isn't wrong for trying to prepare, but he might need to find another solution if she can't help. The wife's reaction suggests she feels overburdened. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but maybe he could have approached it differently. However, based on the information, the answer is likely B (No), because seeking support to manage responsibilities isn't wrong.\n"
