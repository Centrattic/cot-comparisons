I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted about wanting their wife to meal prep before her trip is in the wrong. So the situation is that the wife is going on a week-long trip, and the husband is asking her to prep meals for the kids during her absence. The wife got upset and said it's too much work, suggesting sandwiches if it's too hard.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The husband's reasoning is that he's not used to cooking because his wife usually does it, and the kids are picky. He wants consistency to avoid meltdowns. The wife is upset, maybe because she feels the request is unreasonable or she's already stressed about the trip. \n\nThe question is whether the husband is in the wrong by asking her to prep meals. Let's consider both sides. From the husband's perspective, he's trying to manage responsibilities he's not familiar with. He's working and taking over chores, so meal prepping could help. But the wife is going away, which might be a necessary trip, and maybe she has her own preparations to do. If she's already stressed about the trip, adding meal prep might be too much. \n\nIs it fair to ask her to do the meal prep when she's going to be away? The husband is asking her to do something before she leaves, which might be feasible. However, if she feels it's too much, maybe the husband didn't consider her workload. The wife might feel that her trip is a chance to rest or attend to something important, and being asked to do extra work before leaving could be a burden. \n\nThe husband's argument is that he's unprepared to handle the cooking, and the kids need consistency. But is it reasonable to expect her to prep for a whole week? Meal prepping for a week can be time-consuming and requires effort. If the husband can manage simpler meals like sandwiches, maybe his request is a bit excessive. \n\nAnother angle: communication. Did the husband and wife discuss this beforehand? Maybe the husband didn't consider her feelings and just assumed she could do it. The wife's response suggests she felt the request was unfair, so the husband might not have considered her perspective. \n\nIn terms of fairness, it's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, the husband is trying to prepare for his new responsibilities. On the other, the wife is already going away, and the request might add stress. The outcome depends on their usual dynamic. If the wife is used to cooking and it's her usual role, maybe the husband should have taken more initiative to learn or adjust. \n\nSo, the answer could be B for No, the husband isn't in the wrong. He's trying to manage his responsibilities. But some might argue A for Yes, because he didn't consider her feelings and the extra work. However, given the context\u2014first time alone with the kids, work, etc.\u2014it's reasonable to ask for help, even if it's a bit much. The wife's reaction might be about stress from the trip itself, not the request. Therefore, the husband isn't in the wrong.\n"
