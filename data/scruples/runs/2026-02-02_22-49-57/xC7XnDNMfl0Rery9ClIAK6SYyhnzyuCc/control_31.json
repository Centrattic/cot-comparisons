It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going away for a week, and the husband is worried about handling the kids and chores, especially since cooking is usually her responsibility. He asked her to prepare meals for the week, but she got upset and said it's too much work. He's concerned about the kids' reactions if the food isn't as usual.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband has a valid reason: he's overwhelmed with taking over all the chores and kids, especially since he's not as experienced in cooking as his wife. Meal prepping would make his week easier and ensure the kids eat what they're used to. On the other hand, the wife is going away for the first time, and she might be stressed about that trip. Adding meal prep could add extra pressure on her before she leaves. Maybe she feels it's an unfair request because she's already preparing for her trip, and the husband isn't considering her workload or feelings.\n\nBut the husband's request is reasonable. He's asking for help to manage the household during her absence. It's about shared responsibilities. However, the way he framed the request might matter. If he came across as demanding instead of collaborative, that could be an issue. Also, the wife's response suggests she feels it's too much, so maybe the husband didn't consider her perspective. Perhaps he should have discussed alternatives, like partial prep or other ways to help. But the core issue is whether the request itself is unfair. The husband isn't asking for something unreasonable; he's seeking support during a time when he's overburdened. The wife's refusal might be about not wanting to take on extra work, but the husband isn't in the wrong for needing that support. However, communication could have been better. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. I think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because his request is practical and to support his own ability to manage the household, but there's a nuance in communication. Still, the main point is the fairness of the request itself, not the communication style. So, the answer is B.\n"
