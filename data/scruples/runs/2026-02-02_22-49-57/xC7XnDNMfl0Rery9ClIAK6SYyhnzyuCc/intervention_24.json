It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting his wife to meal prep before her trip. \n\nFirst, the situation: The wife is going on a week-long trip, her first since the kids were born. The husband will be handling all the responsibilities alone, including work and childcare. Cooking is usually the wife's job, and the kids are picky, so he wants her to prep meals for the week. She gets upset, saying it's too much work, and suggests the husband just make sandwiches if it's hard. He argues that he doesn't want the kids to have meltdowns over unfamiliar food, and he thinks it's fair to ask her since she's the one taking the trip.\n\nHmm, I need to consider both sides. The husband's request seems reasonable. He's asking for help to manage a challenging week. The wife, on the other hand, might feel that being asked to prepare meals for a whole week adds extra work on top of her existing responsibilities. But she's the one going on the trip, so maybe it's fair to expect her to assist in making the transition easier for the husband. \n\nThe key points here are mutual responsibility and understanding. The husband is trying to prevent stress and potential problems during her absence. The wife's reaction might stem from feeling overwhelmed or maybe not seeing the husband's perspective. But if the husband is already taking over her half of the chores, it's understandable he'd want some support in the form of prepped meals. \n\nI should also think about communication. Did the husband approach the request sensitively? Maybe he didn't consider her workload before the trip. However, the main issue is whether his request is unfair. Since the wife is the one leaving, and the husband is handling her responsibilities, it's logical he'd want her to help with the transition. The wife's suggestion to just make sandwiches might be dismissive of the husband's concerns about the kids' preferences. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the husband isn't asking for anything unreasonable. Meal prepping for a week is a common practice in many households. The wife's refusal might be based on her own stress about the trip or feeling it's too much. But the husband's perspective is valid because he's trying to maintain stability for the kids, which could affect his ability to work and manage the household. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
