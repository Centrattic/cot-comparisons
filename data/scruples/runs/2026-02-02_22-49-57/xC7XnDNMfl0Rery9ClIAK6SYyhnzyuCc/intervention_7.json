It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the wife is going on a week-long trip, and the author wants her to meal prep for the week before she leaves. The reason is that the wife usually handles cooking, and the kids are picky eaters. The author is worried about handling both work and the kids' meals without her, so he's asking her to prep meals. She gets upset, thinking it's too much work, and suggests he just make sandwiches instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is asking for help to make things easier during a time when he'll be overwhelmed. The wife is going away, so it's her time to herself, and meal prepping might add stress. But the author's request seems reasonable because he's managing a lot without her. He's not asking her to do something she's not responsible for; cooking is already her role. But she's saying it's too much work. Maybe she's already stressed about the trip or the separation.\n\nThe key points are mutual responsibility and communication. If the wife usually handles cooking, asking her to prepare meals for the week before she leaves could be seen as a way to maintain the established routine. The author isn't trying to shift responsibilities but to maintain consistency for the kids. However, the wife might feel it's an extra burden, especially if she's already planning a trip. The argument is whether the request is reasonable given the circumstances.\n\nThe author's intention is to avoid meltdowns from the kids due to unfamiliar food. That's a valid concern. The wife's response of \"just make sandwiches\" might be dismissive, implying that the author should handle it on his own, which could be unfair if he's not as experienced. However, the wife might be overwhelmed with her trip preparations and not want to take on extra work.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author is not overstepping. He's asking for help in an area she already manages. The wife's refusal might stem from personal stress or a different perspective on workload. It's possible that their communication could be improved. The author's request is reasonable, but the wife's reaction might be due to her own feelings about the trip or the added responsibility.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author is not in the wrong. The request is practical and based on their established roles. The wife's refusal might be due to her own stress, but that doesn't make the author's request unreasonable. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
