It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going on a week-long trip, her first time away from the kids since they were born. The author is worried about handling all the chores and cooking, especially since the kids are picky and his wife knows their preferences better. He asked her to prep meals, but she got upset and said it's too much work. He doesn't want to risk the kids' meltdowns if the food isn't right.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that he's managing a lot during her absence, and meal prepping would help him. The wife's reaction is that it's too much work, and she's maybe feeling overwhelmed or not up for the task. The key points here are about fairness, communication, and mutual support in the relationship.\n\nIs it unfair to ask for meal prep? Well, the wife is going away, and it's her first time. Maybe the author is trying to prepare himself for the challenges ahead, which makes sense. But the wife's reaction suggests she might have other priorities or feels that the request is excessive. Maybe she's already stressed about her trip or the separation from the kids. It's possible that the author didn't consider her workload when she's preparing for the trip herself. \n\nAlso, the author assumes that the wife can and should do the meal prep, but he's also acknowledging that she's better at cooking for the kids. However, asking someone to do something extra when they're about to leave might not be the best approach if they're already busy. Communication is key here. Did the author and wife discuss this beforehand? If the wife feels caught off guard or that her efforts aren't being acknowledged, that could lead to tension.\n\nAnother angle: the author mentions that cooking is the wife's responsibility. If that's the case, maybe he's right to expect her to handle meal prepping, even when she's away. But the wife might feel that since she's not there, the responsibility shifts. It's a balance between expecting her to help from afar versus the author taking on more himself. \n\nThe wife's response of \"just make sandwiches\" might be dismissive, but maybe it's a way of saying she's not up for the task. The author's main concern is avoiding meltdowns, which is valid. But if the wife is unable to prep, the author might need to find another solution, maybe compromising by prepping a few meals or getting takeout. \n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it's about the fairness of the request. Since it's her first time away, maybe the author should have planned ahead more, perhaps by prepping meals himself in advance or adjusting the menu. Alternatively, the request isn't unreasonable, but the way it was communicated might have caused the upset. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong because he's trying to manage his responsibilities during her absence, but there's room for better communication and understanding on both sides. The wife's reaction might be valid if she's stressed about her trip, and the author might need to adjust his expectations. However, the core issue is about shared responsibilities and preparation. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong, but the situation could use more dialogue and flexibility.\n"
