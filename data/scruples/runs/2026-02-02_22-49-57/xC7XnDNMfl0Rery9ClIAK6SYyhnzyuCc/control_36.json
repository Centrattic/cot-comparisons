It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the husband is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. His main points are that he's going to be handling all the chores and cooking alone for the first time, especially since the kids are picky and his wife knows their food preferences better. He thinks it's fair because she's the one leaving, and he wants to avoid meltdowns if the kids don't get their usual meals.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is going on her first trip since the kids were born, and the husband feels overwhelmed. He's asking her to prep meals to make his week easier. The wife is upset, thinking it's too much work, and offers an alternative of sandwiches if it's too hard.\n\nIs the request reasonable? Meal prepping for a week might be time-consuming, but the husband is asking for her to prepare dinners, which are typically her responsibility. Since she's the one leaving, maybe he's right to ask for help. However, maybe she's already planning to be away and might be under stress, so adding meal prep could be an extra burden. But he's trying to manage the household without her, so it's understandable he wants support.\n\nThe key here is whether it's unfair to ask her to do this. The husband isn't asking her to do something she's not normally responsible for; he's just extending her usual role into the future while she's away. The wife's response of offering sandwiches seems dismissive, maybe not taking his request seriously. However, the husband's concern about the kids' pickiness is valid. If the wife knows their preferences better, prepping meals would help avoid stress and meltdowns.\n\nOn the other hand, if the wife is already stressed about her trip, adding meal prep might not be feasible. But the husband could have considered this and maybe found a middle ground, like prepping a few days instead of the whole week. However, the question is about whether he's in the wrong. Since he's trying to manage a challenging situation and is asking for help that's within her usual responsibilities, it's reasonable. The wife's upset reaction might be more about feeling overburdened rather than the request being unfair. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
