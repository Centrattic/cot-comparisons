It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a husband asking his wife to meal prep for their kids while she's away on a trip. He's concerned because he's not as familiar with the kids' picky eating habits, and he wants to avoid meltdowns. The wife is upset because she thinks it's too much work.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is going on her first trip since the kids were born, so the husband is taking on all her responsibilities. He's working and handling chores, which is a lot. Cooking isn't his usual task, so asking her to prep meals in advance seems logical for him. The wife's reaction is frustration, feeling that it's too much extra work. \n\nIs the husband being unreasonable? He's not asking her to do something during her trip; he wants her to prepare before she leaves. Since she's the one who usually handles cooking and knows the kids' preferences, maybe it's reasonable. But why is she upset? Maybe she's already preparing for her trip and finds the prep work adding stress. Or perhaps she feels he's not taking responsibility enough. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband is trying to manage without her. It's understandable he wants to avoid the chaos of cooking unfamiliar meals. The question is whether his request is fair. Since she's the one who normally does it, and he's not as experienced, maybe he isn't in the wrong. But if she's already stressed about her trip, adding meal prep might be too much. However, it's her responsibility, and she's not there during the trip. So maybe he's not wrong in asking. \n\nThe key points are: the husband is asking for help to manage a situation he's not used to, and the wife is upset about the extra work. The fairness depends on their usual roles and how reasonable the request is. Since he's not making her do it during her trip but beforehand, and she's the usual cook, it's a valid request. Therefore, the answer is B (not in the wrong).\n"
