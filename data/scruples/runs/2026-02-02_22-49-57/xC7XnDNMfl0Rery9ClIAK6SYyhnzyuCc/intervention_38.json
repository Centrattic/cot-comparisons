It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going on a week-long trip, the first time away from the kids since they were born. The husband will be handling all the chores and cooking alone, which is usually the wife's responsibility. The kids are picky eaters, and the wife knows their preferences better. The husband asked her to prep meals, but she got upset, saying it's too much work, and suggested sandwiches if it's hard.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband is asking for help because he's taking over a significant responsibility. Meal prep could ease his burden, especially since the kids are picky. The wife's reaction is important here\u2014she's upset, which might indicate that the request is a problem. But why is she upset? Maybe she feels it's an extra burden when she's already preparing for the trip. Or perhaps she's stressed about the trip itself and doesn't want additional tasks. \n\nIs it unreasonable to ask her to prep meals? If the husband is taking her responsibilities during her absence, it's logical to want some preparation. However, the wife might feel that the husband should handle it since it's his responsibility now. There's a balance between expecting mutual support and overstepping. The husband is trying to make the transition easier, but the wife might feel it's not her job to do extra work before leaving. \n\nAlso, the husband's concern about kid meltdowns due to unfamiliar food is valid. The wife's suggestion of sandwiches is a compromise, but maybe the husband is worried that sandwiches won't be satisfying for the kids. \n\nIn terms of fairness, if the wife normally handles cooking, it's reasonable to ask her to prepare meals for the week. However, if she's already stressed about the trip, adding meal prep might be unfair. The key is communication\u2014maybe the husband didn't consider her stress levels, but his request is still reasonable. The wife's reaction could be due to underlying stress, not the request itself. So, the author might not be in the wrong, but there's room for understanding both sides. The answer probably leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the request is practical and based on the wife's usual role.\n"
