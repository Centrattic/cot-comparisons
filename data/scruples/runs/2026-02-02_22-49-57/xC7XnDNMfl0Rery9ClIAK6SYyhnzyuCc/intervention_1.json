It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going away for a week, and the husband is worried about handling the kids and chores alone. Cooking is usually the wife's responsibility, and he wants her to prep meals so it's easier on him. She got upset and said it's too much work, offering sandwiches instead.\n\nSo, the user thinks the author isn't wrong, but they want input. I need to decide if the answer is A or B. \n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The husband is asking his wife to do something she normally does, but she's going on a trip. He's concerned about the kids' picky eating and wants consistency. The wife is upset about the prep time. \n\nIs it reasonable to ask? Well, the wife is going away, so maybe she has other things to do. But the husband is asking her to do something she already does. However, the trip is her first time away, so maybe she's stressed about that too. \n\nOn one hand, the husband is trying to prepare for a situation that's new for both of them. On the other hand, the wife might feel that the request is adding to her stress before the trip. \n\nThe wife's response was dismissive, suggesting sandwiches as an alternative. That might be part of the issue. But does the husband have a valid reason? He's handling the kids alone, and the kids are picky. If he's not used to cooking, it could be challenging. \n\nIs the request fair? It depends on their usual dynamics. If the wife usually does the cooking, asking her to prep might make sense. But if the trip is a time for her to relax, maybe she's not in the mood. \n\nI think the husband isn't wrong. He's trying to manage the household without her, and the request is practical. The wife's reaction could be part of the problem, but the request itself isn't unreasonable. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
