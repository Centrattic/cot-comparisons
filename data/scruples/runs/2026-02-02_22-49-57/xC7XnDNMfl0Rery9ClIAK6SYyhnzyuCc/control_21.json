It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that his wife is going away for a week, and he wants her to prepare dinners for the kids because he's not as confident in cooking for them, especially since the kids are picky. She's upset that he's asking her to do that, saying it's too much work and offers to just make sandwiches if it's hard. He thinks it's not unfair since she's the one going away.\n\nHmm. So first, I need to consider both sides. The author is asking for help that makes sense given the situation. He's taking on her half of the chores, and cooking is part of her responsibility. Since the kids are picky, relying on sandwiches might be less stressful than trying to cook unfamiliar meals. But his wife is already stressed about the trip and possibly the extra work. Maybe she's overwhelmed with packing and other preparations, so adding meal prep could be too much. \n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. Did the author consider her workload or feelings when making the request? He mentioned she got really upset, which suggests maybe the request was made in a way that didn't account for her stress. However, his reasoning is valid\u2014he's trying to manage the kids' needs. \n\nIs it fair to ask her to preplan meals? Well, she's the one who knows the kids' preferences. If she's capable and it's within her capacity, then it's reasonable. But if she's already overburdened, maybe he should have offered a different solution. However, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong just for asking. Sometimes in relationships, partners help each other out with responsibilities, especially when it's about the kids. \n\nOn the flip side, maybe the author could have been more understanding if she declined. Instead of pushing her to prep, he could have accepted the sandwiches or found another compromise. But the main question is whether he's in the wrong for making the request. Since he's trying to ensure the kids' well-being and the wife is the one who's going away, the request isn't inherently unfair. So the answer is probably B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
