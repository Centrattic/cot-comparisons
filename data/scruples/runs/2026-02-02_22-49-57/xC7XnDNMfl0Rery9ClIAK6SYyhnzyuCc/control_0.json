It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author asked his wife to meal prep for the week she's away so he can handle the kids and chores alone. The wife got upset, thinking it's too much work, and suggested he just make sandwiches. The author thinks it's fair to ask her since she's going away.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's reasoning is practical: the kids are picky, he's not as familiar with their preferences, and he's stressed about managing alone. Meal prepping would make things easier. On the other hand, the wife might feel that being asked to prep meals on top of her own trip preparations is an extra burden. Maybe she's already stressed about the trip or her work, and adding meal prep seems like an unreasonable request. \n\nIs it fair to ask someone to do extra work before a trip? Well, if the author knows that meal prepping would help him, maybe he should have considered that earlier. But the wife might feel it's not her responsibility anymore, or she might think the author should handle it since he's the one staying. There's also the aspect of communication. Did they discuss this beforehand? If the author didn't plan ahead, maybe that's on him. However, he did explain his reasoning, and the wife reacted negatively without considering the alternative of sandwiches.\n\nThe key points here are about fairness and mutual support. The author is asking for help that would make his week manageable, which is reasonable. But the wife might feel overwhelmed. The answer depends on whether the request is seen as a reasonable ask for help or an imposition. Since the author is in a vulnerable position (first time alone with the kids), it's understandable he wants to prepare. The wife's refusal could be due to her own stress about the trip. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because he's asking for support that makes sense given the circumstances. The wife's reaction might be valid if she's overburdened, but the author's request is reasonable. So the answer is B.\n"
