It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for asking his wife to prep meals before her trip. \n\nFirst, the situation: The wife is going away on a week-long trip, the first time since the kids were born. The husband has to take over all her chores, including cooking, which he's not as comfortable with. The kids are picky eaters, and the wife knows their preferences better. He asked her to prep dinners for the week so it's easier for him. She got upset and said it's too much work, suggesting sandwiches instead.\n\nI need to evaluate if the request is reasonable. The husband's argument is that he's asking for help because he's not as experienced, and the kids might not like the food if he makes it. But the wife is already taking a week away, so maybe she's in a different time zone or has her own tasks? The husband is taking on her usual chores, so asking her to prep could be seen as sharing the workload before she leaves. However, she's already gone, so maybe she's not around to cook during the trip. But she's asking her to prepare before leaving, which might be a one-time effort. \n\nPossible points to consider: Is meal prepping a reasonable request given the circumstances? The husband is asking for support because he's overwhelmed. The wife might feel that she's already giving up time, and the prep work is adding more. But the husband's need is valid because he's not as skilled. Maybe the wife could have said she's willing to do something else instead of full prepping. \n\nIs there a middle ground? The wife suggested sandwiches, but the husband feels that's not ideal. The key is whether the request is fair. Since the wife is leaving, she's not there to cook, so prepping is a way to help. The husband is asking for a favor to ease his burden, which is understandable. The wife's reaction might be about the amount of work, but the husband's request is to help him manage. \n\nI think the husband isn't in the wrong. He's asking for support in a stressful time. The wife's refusal might be about workload, but the husband's request is reasonable. So answer B.\n"
