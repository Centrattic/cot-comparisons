It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for wanting their wife to meal prep before her trip.\n\nFirst, the situation: The wife is going on a week-long trip for the first time since the kids were born. The husband will be handling all the chores and cooking alone. Normally, the wife does the cooking, and she knows the kids' preferences better. He asked her to prep meals for the week to make it easier, but she got upset and refused, suggesting he just make sandwiches if it's too hard.\n\nSo, the main points here are about expectations and fairness. The husband is asking for help to manage the household alone, especially since the kids are picky. The wife feels it's too much work. The question is whether his request is unreasonable.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The husband's request is practical\u2014he's trying to prepare for a challenging week. The wife's reaction might be due to stress or feeling overburdened. Maybe she's already preparing for her trip and feels this is an extra task. Or perhaps she feels he's not doing his part to handle the chores without her help.\n\nBut is the husband in the wrong? Well, he's asking for something that's within her capability (meal prepping) before her trip. Since she's going away, it's logical she would do it before leaving. He's not asking her to stay and help; he's just asking for a week's worth of prepped meals. It's reasonable to want consistency for the kids, reducing stress.\n\nHowever, maybe the wife feels that the husband should take more responsibility without her help. But the husband is already acknowledging his limitations and the kids' pickiness. He's not expecting her to do all the work during her trip, just prior to it.\n\nSo, the husband's request seems fair. The wife's refusal might be due to other stressors, but the husband isn't in the wrong for making a reasonable ask. Therefore, the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
