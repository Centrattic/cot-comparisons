It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the husband) is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going away for a week, and the husband is worried about handling the kids and chores alone, especially cooking since the kids are picky. He asked her to prep meals for the week, but she was upset and said it's too much work, suggesting he could make sandwiches instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband has a valid concern. Taking over all the chores, including cooking, when the kids are picky could be really stressful. He's asking for help to make it manageable. On the other hand, the wife is going on a trip, which is a personal time she's earned, and meal prepping for a week is a significant task. It's possible she's already stressed about her trip or maybe she feels that asking her to prep is unfair when she's trying to relax.\n\nThe husband's request isn't unreasonable. He's acknowledging that he can do it, but wants to avoid possible meltdowns from the kids if the food isn't right. However, the wife's reaction suggests she might feel overwhelmed or that the request is an added burden on her trip. Maybe she's already planning to do a lot of packing or has her own stressors related to the trip. It's important to communicate and find a middle ground. But in terms of right or wrong, the husband is justified in wanting help, especially since the wife is the one who normally handles cooking and knows the kids' preferences better. The wife's refusal might be based on her own capacity, but that doesn't necessarily make the husband's request wrong. He's not forcing her; he's asking. So unless there's more context about past interactions or agreements, the husband isn't in the wrong.\n"
