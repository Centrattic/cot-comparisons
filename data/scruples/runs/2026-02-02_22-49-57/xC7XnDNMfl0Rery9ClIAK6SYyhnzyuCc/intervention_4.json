It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person (AITA) is wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the wife is going on a week-long trip, first time away from the kids. The husband will be handling all the chores and cooking, which is usually the wife's responsibility. The kids are picky eaters, and the wife knows their preferences better. The husband asked her to prep meals so it's easier for him. She got upset, saying that's too much work, and suggested he just make sandwiches if it's too hard. The husband feels it's fair to ask since she's taking a week off.\n\nHmm. The husband's reasoning is that he's not used to cooking for picky kids, so meal prep would help avoid meltdowns. He's asking for help before she leaves to make his week manageable. The wife's response is that it's too much work. But is it reasonable?\n\nI think the husband's request is practical. He's trying to prepare for the challenge he's facing. Since cooking is her usual role, she's in a better position to prep meals that the kids will like. The wife might be overwhelmed by the prep work, but the husband's concern is about managing without her. Maybe there's a middle ground, like prepping a few meals instead of all, but the question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nI don't see him being in the wrong. He's asking for support before her trip to make his week feasible. The wife's refusal might stem from her own stress about the trip or not wanting the extra work. But the husband's request seems reasonable. So the answer is B.\n"
