It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband asked his wife to meal prep for the week she's away so he can handle the kids and chores. The wife got upset and said it's too much work, suggesting he make sandwiches instead. The husband feels it's not unfair to ask since she's taking the trip.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's request is about managing the household while she's away. He's already taking on extra chores and work, and meal prep would help prevent stress with picky kids. He might be reasonable in expecting some help from her since she's the one leaving. On the other hand, the wife might feel overburdened. Meal prepping for a week can be time-consuming, especially if she's already busy. Maybe she didn't realize the extent of the problem or didn't want to add to her own workload before the trip.\n\nIs the husband in the wrong? He's asking for something practical. It's reasonable to expect a spouse to help prepare for their absence, especially in a domestic division of labor. But maybe he didn't consider her workload or the time required. However, he's not asking her to do it all; just prepping meals for the week. The wife's reaction seems a bit harsh if her role is typically cooking. If she's the main cook, it's logical she knows the kids' preferences better. So the husband's request is practical. But maybe he should have discussed it earlier or offered to help with the prep. Did he? The question says he asked her to prep, so maybe he didn't offer to assist. But the wife's refusal might be because she's overwhelmed. \n\nIn terms of fairness, it's about shared responsibilities. If she's the primary cook, it's reasonable for her to prepare meals in advance. The husband is taking on her chores, so expecting her to handle the meal prep could be fair. However, if she has her own preparations for the trip, maybe she feels it's too much. The key is whether the request is reasonable given their usual responsibilities. The husband's reasoning makes sense, but the wife's stress is also valid. However, the question is whether the author (husband) is in the wrong. Since he's asking for help that aligns with her usual role, and the wife's refusal seems to dismiss his legitimate need, the husband isn't in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
