It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is asking if they're at fault for asking their wife to meal prep before her trip. The key points here are that the wife is going away for a week, the author is taking over all her chores, and the kids are picky eaters. The author wants prepped meals because they're not as experienced with the kids' preferences, but the wife feels it's too much work.\n\nFirst, considering the situation: the author is handling a lot more responsibility during the week. It's their first time managing alone since the kids were born. The wife normally handles cooking, which is a significant part of the household duties. The author is trying to plan ahead to avoid potential issues with the kids, which makes sense. They're not asking for something unreasonable per se, but maybe the timing or the way it was asked could be a factor. However, the main argument is that the author is trying to make things easier for themselves and the kids, which seems valid. The wife's reaction might stem from stress about her trip or feeling overwhelmed, but the author's request is practical. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
