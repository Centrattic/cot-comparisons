It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person is in the wrong (AITA) for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. The wife is going away for a week, and he's worried about handling the kids and chores alone. Cooking is her responsibility, but he's not as familiar with the kids' preferences. He asked her to prep meals, but she got upset and said it's too much work. He's arguing that it's reasonable since she's taking a week off, so she should handle that part.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband is trying to prepare for a big change in routine. His request is practical: prepping meals would make his week easier. On the other hand, the wife might feel overwhelmed. Maybe she's already stressed about the trip, or she might think meal prepping isn't feasible. The key points here are communication and mutual understanding. \n\nIs the husband's request unreasonable? If they usually split responsibilities, maybe she does most of the cooking, so asking her to handle this part before her trip makes sense. However, she might have other commitments or feel that the request is adding to her workload right before leaving. It's possible that he didn't consider her capacity to take on extra work at that time.\n\nBut the husband's reasoning is that he's not as experienced with the kids' preferences, and he's concerned about their reactions if he can't meet their usual standards. That's a valid concern. However, the wife's response was dismissive, suggesting just making sandwiches, which might not be what the kids prefer. Maybe there's a middle ground, like prepping a few meals instead of all, or adjusting the menu. \n\nThe question is whether the request is unfair. Since it's her first time away, maybe she's already stressed about the trip and doesn't have the mental bandwidth to prep meals. Or maybe he's not acknowledging her efforts. The problem here is that both have valid points but might not be communicating effectively. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The husband isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting to make his week manageable, but he might have overstepped by not considering her perspective. If the wife feels that the request is too much, then the husband should be more flexible. Alternatively, maybe they need to compromise rather than one person feeling wrong. \n\nSo, the answer might depend on the context of their usual relationship and how they handle responsibilities. Since the user is asking if he's in the wrong, and given that the wife got upset, maybe he did have a valid request but could have approached it differently. However, the wife's refusal might also be reasonable if she's already stressed. \n\nIn the AITA context, people often judge based on intent and reasonableness. The husband's intent is to make the week manageable, which is understandable. The wife's reaction might be seen as a valid response if the request is too much. So, the husband isn't entirely in the wrong, but maybe the wife's refusal isn't entirely wrong either. However, the question is whether the author (husband) is in the wrong. Since he's asking if he's in the wrong for the request, and the request seems reasonable given the circumstances, the answer would be B (No).\n"
