It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the wife is going on a week-long trip, which is the first time the husband is handling everything alone with the kids. The wife usually does the cooking, and the kids are picky. The husband asked her to meal prep for the week so he can manage better. She got upset, saying it's too much work, and suggested he just make sandwiches.\n\nFirst, the husband's reasoning is that he's not used to cooking for the kids, and they're picky. Since the wife knows their preferences, he wants her to prepare meals in advance. The wife is taking a week off, so it makes sense he's asking her to help before she leaves. But she's upset about the extra work. \n\nNow, the question is whether the husband is in the wrong. Let's think about responsibilities. They have shared responsibilities, but if cooking is her main responsibility, and he's stepping in temporarily, it's reasonable to ask her to help with meal prep before she leaves. It's a proactive step to prevent problems. She has the time before the trip, so prepping meals isn't something that has to be done during her trip. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife might feel that the request is adding extra work on top of her existing tasks. Maybe she's already busy with packing or other preparations. But if it's within her capability and she's the one who usually cooks, then the husband's request seems fair. He's not asking her to do more than she's already responsible for; he's just asking for a bit of planning ahead. \n\nAnother point is communication. The husband might not have expressed his concerns clearly, leading to her feeling overwhelmed. However, the request itself seems reasonable. The wife could have offered alternatives, like prepping some meals and letting him handle others, but she dismissed the idea by suggesting sandwiches, which might not be in line with the kids' preferences. \n\nIn terms of fairness, since the wife is the one leaving, it's logical she would help in a way that makes the transition easier. If she's the primary cook, asking her to prep meals for the week is a way to maintain consistency. The husband isn't making her do anything during her trip; he's just asking for advance preparation. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the husband's request is a practical solution to a problem. The wife's reaction might be due to stress or feeling overburdened, but the husband isn't in the wrong for asking for help that aligns with her usual role. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
