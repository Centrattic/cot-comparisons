It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for wanting their wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going on a week-long trip, her first since the kids were born, so the husband has to take over all her chores. Cooking is her responsibility, and since the kids are picky, he wants her to prep meals for the week. She's upset and thinks it's too much work, suggesting sandwiches instead.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the husband is in the wrong. The key points here are the request for meal prep, the wife's reaction, and the context of the trip being her first time away. The husband is asking for help to manage the kids' meals, which is understandable because he's not used to doing it alone. The wife is taking time off, which is valid, but he's asking her to do extra work before leaving. \n\nIs it unfair? Well, the husband is trying to make things easier for himself, but maybe he didn't consider that the meal prep could be a significant task. The wife might feel that after a trip, she's already going to be away and not present, so being asked to do extra work before departure is adding stress. He might not be wrong for wanting to plan ahead, but maybe he didn't communicate effectively or consider her perspective. \n\nOn the other hand, he's in a new situation where he's taking over responsibilities he's not used to. The kids are picky, so relying on prepped meals makes sense. The wife's solution of sandwiches is less ideal for the kids, so there's a valid concern there. \n\nI think the husband isn't entirely in the wrong because his request is practical. However, maybe the way he asked or the assumption that she must do it without considering her workload could be a point. But given the information, he's asking for help to manage a challenging week. So the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
