It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going away for a week, the first time since the kids were born. The husband is taking over her chores, including cooking, which is normally her responsibility. The kids are picky, and he knows they eat better when she cooks. So he asked her to prep dinners for the week. She got upset, said it's too much work, and suggested he just make sandwiches if it's hard.\n\nHmm. So the question is whether the husband is at fault. I need to consider both perspectives. The husband's reasoning is that he's asking for help because he's overwhelmed, and the kids are picky. The wife is going on a trip, so maybe she's already preparing and stressed. She might feel that asking her to prep meals on top of her trip preparations is too much. But the husband is trying to manage his workload and ensure the kids eat well.\n\nIs the husband in the wrong? Well, his request is reasonable in that he's asking for support to handle the added responsibility. However, maybe he didn't consider how much extra work it is for her. The wife might be dealing with her own stress from the trip, and adding meal prepping could be overwhelming. Alternatively, maybe the husband didn't communicate his needs clearly, or perhaps he didn't realize she was already doing a lot. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband is trying to be proactive. He's not asking for something unreasonable; he's just seeking help. The wife's response about making sandwiches if it's too hard suggests she might be dismissive of his concerns. But maybe she has valid reasons to say no. \n\nIn terms of fairness, if the wife is going away, perhaps she should prepare as much as possible. But if she's already stressed, adding prepping meals might not be feasible. The key here is mutual understanding. The husband's request is understandable, but maybe he should have offered to help with some of the prep or found another solution. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because he's trying to manage his responsibilities and the kids' needs. It's a reasonable request, even if the wife feels it's too much. The problem might be in the communication rather than the request itself. Unless there's a prior agreement or a specific reason the wife can't prep, the husband isn't necessarily wrong. The wife's reaction might stem from her own stress, but that doesn't make the husband wrong for asking. So the answer is B.\n"
