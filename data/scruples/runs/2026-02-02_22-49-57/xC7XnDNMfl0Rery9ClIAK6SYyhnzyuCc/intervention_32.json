It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault (AITA) for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. The wife is going away for a week, and the husband is worried about handling the kids and chores alone. Cooking is her responsibility, and he's asking her to prep meals because the kids are picky and he's not as familiar with their preferences. She got upset, saying it's too much work and suggested he just make sandwiches.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband is taking on a lot more responsibility during her absence. It's his first time managing alone with the kids. He's working, so time is a factor. He's asking for help that would make the week easier, not just for him but for the kids too. The wife is going away, which is a temporary situation. Her not wanting to prep might be because she's stressed about the trip or feels it's an extra burden beyond her already existing responsibilities.\n\nBut wait, is it fair to ask her to do extra work when she's about to leave? Meal prepping is time-consuming and might interfere with her trip preparations. Maybe she's already overwhelmed. However, the husband's request is reasonable if it's to make his transition easier. The kids' preferences are an important factor here. If the kids have meltdowns over food, it's a valid concern. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife's reaction might indicate that she feels the husband isn't sharing the load equally or that he's making an unfair request. Maybe she feels he should take more responsibility instead of expecting her to do more before leaving. \n\nThe key points are: the husband's request is to make the week manageable, the wife is going away, and she's upset about the prep work. It's a balance between mutual support and individual burdens. The husband isn't wrong for wanting help, but maybe he didn't consider her perspective. However, given the context, his request seems reasonable. So the answer is likely B (Not in the wrong). He's asking for help that's in the best interest of the kids and himself during a challenging time. The wife's refusal could be due to stress, but the husband's intent is valid.\n"
