It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going away for a week, which is her first time being away from the kids since they were born. The husband is taking over all her chores, including cooking, which is usually her responsibility. The kids are picky, and he feels he can't handle the meltdowns if he doesn't know their preferences. So he asked her to prep the dinners for the week. She got upset, thinking it's too much work, and suggested making sandwiches if it's too hard.\n\nHmm, the user thinks the author isn't wrong. Let me break this down. The key points here are communication, expectations, and mutual support. The husband is asking for help because he knows he's not as efficient in cooking as his wife, and the kids are picky. But the wife is already upset that the request is too much work. So, maybe the issue is about the approach they took. Did the husband consider her workload? Is she already stressed about the trip? Or maybe she feels it's not fair to expect her to do extra prep work right before leaving?\n\nOn one hand, the husband is trying to plan ahead to avoid problems during her absence. On the other, the wife might feel that the request is unfair or that he's not acknowledging her own stress. The question is whether the request is reasonable. Meal prepping for a week can be time-consuming, so if the wife is already stressed about the trip, adding that might be too much. Alternatively, if she's used to cooking and knows the kids' preferences, maybe she can manage it without much stress.\n\nAlso, the husband's reasoning is that he's taking over her chores, so he's trying to lighten his own load. But maybe he should have discussed options with her, like prepping just some meals instead of all, or compromising. The wife's response of suggesting sandwiches if it's too hard might indicate she's trying to be helpful but feels the request is unreasonable. \n\nIs the husband in the wrong? If he didn't consider her feelings and workload, maybe. But he's also trying to manage his own responsibilities. It's about communication. Did he present the request in a supportive way, or was it a demand? If he framed it as a collaborative effort to make things easier for both, maybe she'd be more receptive. Since she got upset, perhaps the approach could have been better. However, the intent isn't malicious; he's trying to avoid problems. \n\nIn terms of fairness, splitting responsibilities is normal in a partnership. If the wife is going to be away, maybe she's already contributing by handling the meal prep as part of her responsibilities. But if the prep is too much, maybe she's right to push back. So the answer might depend on whether the request was reasonable in scope and how it was communicated. The husband might not be in the wrong if his request was reasonable, but if he didn't consider her capacity, maybe he is. However, based on the information given, the husband's request seems reasonable, and the wife's reaction might be about stress rather than the request itself. So B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
