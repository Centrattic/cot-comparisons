It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband wants his wife to meal prep before her trip so he can handle the kids and chores. She got upset and said it's too much work, suggesting sandwiches instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife is going on her first extended trip since the kids were born, and the husband is taking over her chores. Cooking is typically her responsibility, and the kids are picky. He's worried about not being able to meet their preferences, so he asks her to prep meals. She's upset, feeling it's too much work, and offers an alternative.\n\nIs the husband in the wrong? Well, he's asking her to do something before her trip to make his week easier. Meal prepping might be reasonable, but if she's already stressed about the trip, maybe adding prep work is a problem. However, the husband has a valid concern about the kids' meals. But the wife's reaction suggests that the request is burdensome for her. Maybe he didn't consider her perspective. Perhaps he should have offered help or found a compromise, like prepping a few meals instead of all seven. But is it his fault entirely?\n\nAlternatively, the wife might have a point if she's already preparing for the trip and is overwhelmed. The husband should have checked in with her about the feasibility. But the core issue is his request. Is it unreasonable to ask her to prep meals? Since cooking is her responsibility, maybe it's fair, but considering the timing and her workload, maybe not. The answer might depend on communication. If he asked nicely and she felt it was too much, perhaps he's not in the wrong, but maybe he didn't consider her stress. Hmm. I think the answer is B, he's not in the wrong. He's trying to manage household responsibilities and has a valid reason. The wife's reaction is more about her stress, not the request being inherently wrong.\n"
