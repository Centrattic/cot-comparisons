It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for asking their wife to meal prep before her trip. The main points are that the wife is going away for a week, which is her first time away from the kids since they were born. The husband is worried about handling the chores and cooking, especially since the kids are picky and he's not as experienced. He asked her to prep meals, but she got upset and refused, suggesting he can just make sandwiches if it's too hard.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband is taking on a new challenge by being solely responsible for the kids and chores. Meal prep could make this easier for him. On the other hand, asking his wife to do this right before her trip might add stress for her. It's possible she's already dealing with the logistics of her trip and might not have the bandwidth for additional tasks. \n\nIs it fair to ask her to prep meals? Well, she's the primary cook, and he's acknowledging that she knows the kids' preferences better. So his request is based on practicality. However, he's also expecting her to take on extra work just before a trip, which might be a fair point of contention. Maybe he didn't consider how much time meal prepping would take or if she's already overwhelmed with her trip preparations. \n\nThe wife's reaction could stem from feeling that the request is unreasonable, especially if she's already stressed about her trip. If she's not willing to prep, maybe she expects him to adjust instead. The husband might not be in the wrong because he's trying to manage the household, but he could be misunderstanding her capacity or stress level. \n\nAlternatively, he is in the wrong if he's not considering her perspective. He should have maybe discussed this earlier or found a compromise. Since she's going on a trip, it's possible she has her own things to handle, and adding meal prep might be too much. \n\nIn terms of fairness, it's a balance between his need for support and her ability to provide it. If he's asking for something that's a significant additional task, especially right before a trip, it's reasonable for her to push back. But if she's capable and just unwilling, then the husband's request isn't inherently wrong. The key is whether the request is reasonable given their circumstances. Since he's the one taking on all the responsibilities, maybe he should have anticipated the need for meal prep and communicated it earlier. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong now. \n\nConsidering all these angles, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because his request is practical and based on the need for support while she's away. However, it's possible he didn't consider her stress levels. But the core issue is that he's asking for something that would make his week manageable, which isn't unreasonable. The wife's refusal might be more about her own stress than the request itself. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
