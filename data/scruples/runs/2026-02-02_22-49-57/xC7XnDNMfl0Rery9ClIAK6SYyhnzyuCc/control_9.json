It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband wants his wife to meal prep before her trip, but she's upset and refuses. He argues that she usually handles cooking and knows the kids' preferences better, so he needs the prepped meals to manage without her. She thinks it's too much work and suggests he can just make sandwiches if it's too hard.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband is asking for help that makes sense given the circumstances. He's taking on more responsibilities with the kids and work, and meal prepping could ease the burden. He's not asking her to do something harmful, just to plan ahead. On the other hand, the wife is going away for the first time since the kids were born, which is a significant event. She might feel overwhelmed preparing meals for a week, especially if she's already preparing for her trip. Also, she's suggesting an alternative (sandwiches) which shows she's trying to accommodate, but he's not accepting that.\n\nIs the husband in the wrong? Well, he's not making an unreasonable request. He's explaining his need based on the kids' picky eating and his own limitations. However, the wife's feelings are valid too. She might feel pressured, especially if she's already stressed about the trip. Maybe he could have approached it differently, like offering to help with the prep or finding a middle ground, like prepping a few meals instead of all seven. But the core issue is whether his request is unfair. Since he's trying to manage without her and she's in a position to help (since she's going away anyway), it's not entirely his fault. However, his tone or approach might have been better. But according to the story, he's not asking for something unreasonable. So the answer might be B, he's not in the wrong. But I need to check if there's any nuance I'm missing. The wife being upset could be due to the timing or the amount of work. The husband's reasoning seems logical, so the answer is probably B.\n"
