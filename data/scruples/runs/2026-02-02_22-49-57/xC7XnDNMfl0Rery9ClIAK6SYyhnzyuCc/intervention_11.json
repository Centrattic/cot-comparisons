It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their wife to meal prep before her trip. The author's wife is going on a week-long trip, and they need to handle all the chores and cooking. The kids are picky, and the author isn't as confident in the kitchen as the wife. So the author asked her to prep meals, but she got upset, thinking it's too much work.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author is asking for help to manage the extra workload during the week when the wife is away. It makes sense because the kids are used to the wife's cooking, and the author is worried about meltdowns if the food isn't right. Meal prepping could save time and reduce stress.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might feel that the request is adding more work on top of her trip preparations. Maybe she's already stressed about being away and feels that the author isn't sharing the load properly. The author is taking over her chores, so perhaps she feels that the author should handle the cooking now. Or maybe the wife isn't comfortable with the time or effort needed to prep meals for a week.\n\nIs it fair to ask her to prep? Well, she's the one who knows the kids' preferences, so it might be more efficient for her to prep. But if the trip is her time to rest or recover, adding meal prep could be an unfair burden. However, the author is trying to make the transition easier, which seems reasonable. \n\nThe key points here are mutual understanding and communication. The author's request is practical, but the wife's reaction suggests there's an underlying issue. Maybe they haven't discussed household responsibilities clearly, or there's a mismatch in expectations about shared duties. \n\nIn terms of fairness, asking for help when you're taking on more responsibilities isn't inherently wrong. The author is trying to manage the situation to avoid meltdowns, which is a valid concern. However, the wife's perspective is also valid if she feels overburdened. The problem might be more about how the request was made or a lack of compromise.\n\nBut based on the information given, the author's request seems reasonable. They're asking for support to handle an unusual situation. The wife's refusal could be due to stress or other factors not mentioned. The author isn't wrong for wanting to prepare, especially since they're not asking for anything unreasonable. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
