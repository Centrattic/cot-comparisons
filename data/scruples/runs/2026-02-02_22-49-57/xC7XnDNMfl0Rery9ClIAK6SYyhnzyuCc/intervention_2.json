It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going away for a week, and the husband is worried about handling the kids and chores alone. He asked her to prep dinners because he's not as confident in cooking for picky kids, and she got upset, saying it's too much work.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband's reasoning is practical: the kids are used to his wife's cooking, and he's worried about meltdowns if he can't meet their preferences. He's taking on a big load by handling everything alone, so asking her to prep meals makes sense as a way to reduce stress. On the other hand, the wife might feel that the request is unfair or added stress before her trip. Maybe she's already busy or doesn't want the extra responsibility right before leaving.\n\nBut the key points here are that the husband is managing the household alone for the first time and is asking for help that he's not confident doing himself. The wife is being asked to do something that's within her usual responsibilities. The husband isn't asking her to take over during the trip, just to prep meals in advance so he can manage. The wife's response of \"just make sandwiches\" seems dismissive and might not address the husband's actual concerns, especially if the kids are picky and sandwiches might not be sufficient.\n\nI think the husband is in the right because he's being proactive and reasonable. The wife's reaction might stem from stress or feeling overwhelmed, but the husband's request is valid given the circumstances. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
