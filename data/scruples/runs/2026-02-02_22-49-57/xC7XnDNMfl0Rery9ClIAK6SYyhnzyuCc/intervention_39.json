It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going away for a week, and the author will be handling all the chores and cooking for the kids. Since the kids are picky and the wife usually does the cooking, he asked her to preprep meals. She got upset and refused, saying it's too much work.\n\nHmm. The author's reasoning is that he's trying to avoid the kids' meltdowns from unfamiliar food. He's taking over her responsibilities during her absence, so asking her to help in advance makes sense. But maybe the wife feels that since she's already taking time off, she shouldn't have to work extra. There's a balance here between mutual support and expectations during a partner's absence.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to consider both perspectives. The author is trying to make things easier for himself, which is understandable. However, the wife's reaction might indicate that she feels overwhelmed or that the request is unreasonable given her own plans. Maybe the author could have approached it differently, like discussing alternatives or acknowledging her effort. But is that enough to say he's in the wrong?\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author's request is practical, but maybe he didn't consider her perspective. However, the wife's refusal without offering an alternative might also be an issue. Since the author is seeking support for his position, and the wife's response seems dismissive, the author's stance is reasonable. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
