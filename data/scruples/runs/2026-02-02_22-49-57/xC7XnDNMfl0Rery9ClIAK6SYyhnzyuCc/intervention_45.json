It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. The author's wife is going on a week-long trip, her first time away from the kids since they were born. He's concerned about handling the chores and cooking, especially since the kids are picky and she knows their preferences better. He asked her to prep dinners for the week, but she got upset, thinking it's too much work, and suggested he make sandwiches instead.\n\nHmm. The author's reasoning is that he's taking over her half of the chores and wants to avoid meltdowns from the kids not having their usual food. He doesn't think it's unfair since she's leaving for a week. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong but wants my opinion. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a legitimate concern about managing the household alone, especially with kids. Meal prepping could save him time and stress. However, his wife might feel overwhelmed, especially if she's already preparing for her trip. She might see the request as adding extra work on top of her travel prep. \n\nIs it reasonable to ask her to do the meal prep? Well, since she's the primary cook and knows the kids' preferences, it makes sense. But maybe the timing is bad. She's going to be busy with her trip, so the author might not have considered her workload. Alternatively, maybe she's not willing to take on extra tasks even if it's for the family. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual understanding. The author's request is practical, but he might not have considered his wife's feelings or capacity. On the other hand, she might not have explained why she can't do it. The problem might be more about how the request was made rather than the request itself. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author wants to reduce his own stress and ensure the kids are well-fed. It's reasonable to ask for help, especially since she's the one who usually does it. But if she's already stressed about the trip, adding meal prep could be too much. The author might need to find a middle ground, like prepping a few meals instead of all, or adjusting expectations. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Not necessarily. His intentions are good. However, he might not have considered his wife's perspective. The issue could be a communication breakdown rather than a clear right or wrong. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and the options are A or B, I need to decide. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because his request is reasonable and based on practical needs. However, there's room for better communication and compromise. The main issue isn't his request but how it was received. So, I'll go with B.\n"
