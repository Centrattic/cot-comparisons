It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about the wife going on a trip and the husband asking her to meal prep for the week. The husband's reasoning is that he's not as familiar with the kids' picky eating as the wife is, and he wants to avoid meltdowns. The wife is upset because she thinks it's too much work.\n\nSo, first, I need to evaluate the request. Meal prepping isn't unreasonable, especially since the wife knows the kids' preferences better. The husband is taking on her other chores, so cooking might be an extra burden he's not used to. But he's asking her to do something before she leaves, which is a one-time effort for her. The wife's response is that it's too much work and suggests sandwiches instead. The husband feels it's fair because she's going away, so she's not taking over his responsibilities during her absence.\n\nIs the husband in the wrong? Well, he's making a reasonable request for help, not an unreasonable one. The wife is choosing not to do it, but the husband isn't forcing her. It's more about their communication and priorities. The husband isn't wrong for wanting to make things easier for himself, especially given the circumstances. The wife's reaction might stem from stress or feeling overwhelmed, but the request itself isn't unreasonable. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
