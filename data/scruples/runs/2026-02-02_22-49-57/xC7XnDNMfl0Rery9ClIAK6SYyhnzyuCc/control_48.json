It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their wife to prep meals before her trip. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author's wife is going on a week-long trip, which is her first time away from the kids since they were born. The husband mentions that he'll have to take over her chores, including cooking, which he can do but isn't as familiar with the kids' food preferences. He asked her to prep dinners for the week to make it easier for him. She got upset and refused, suggesting that he can just make sandwiches if it's too hard. The author feels it's not unfair to ask since she's the one going away.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife is taking a break, which is understandable, especially after being the primary cook. The husband is stepping in, but he's not as confident in her kids' preferences. He's trying to avoid meltdowns from the kids if the food isn't right. The wife's reaction seems a bit harsh because she's the one going away, yet she's resistant to helping. \n\nBut wait, meal prepping might be a lot of work, even though it's for a week. The wife might feel overwhelmed or stressed about the trip, and the request could add to that stress. However, the husband has a valid point about the kids' pickiness and wanting consistency. \n\nIs the author being reasonable? He's asking for help to manage a situation that's new for him. On the other hand, the wife might feel that the request is an extra burden when she's already preparing for her trip. But since she's the one leaving, maybe the responsibility should be on her to ease the transition. \n\nI think the key here is whether the request is reasonable. The husband isn't asking her to do something unreasonable; he's just asking for prepped meals to avoid stress. The wife's response of suggesting sandwiches seems dismissive. If the husband is struggling with cooking, the wife's refusal might be contributing to his stress. \n\nBut maybe the wife has her own reasons for not wanting to prep, like time constraints or physical exhaustion. However, since she's the one going away, it's fair to expect her to assist in setting things up. The husband is trying to be proactive. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong. His request is practical, and the wife's refusal might be based on her own stress rather than a valid reason. So the answer should be B.\n"
