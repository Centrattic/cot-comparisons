It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for wanting their wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going away for a week, the husband is worried about handling the kids and chores alone. He asked her to prep dinners because he's not as familiar with the kids' picky eating as she is. She got upset and offered to make sandwiches instead if it's too hard. He feels it's not unfair since she's going away.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband's request seems reasonable. He's asking for help to manage a challenging week when she won't be there. Meal prepping could make a big difference in reducing stress. But the wife is upset, maybe because she feels overburdened. Maybe she's already doing a lot, and adding meal prep on top of her trip preparations is too much. Or perhaps she feels her contribution is being undervalued, thinking that if it's too hard, he should handle it himself.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual understanding. The husband's request is practical, given his inexperience with the kids' preferences. However, the wife's reaction suggests she might feel it's an added burden or that her efforts aren't appreciated. It's important to consider whether the husband's request is reasonable but maybe the way he presented it could be improved. Alternatively, maybe he's right in asking for support since she's the one taking the trip and not being there to help. \n\nAnother angle is that sometimes when someone is going on a trip, they might expect the other partner to step up, especially if the trip is a rare opportunity. The husband is trying to prepare to avoid meltdowns, which are stressful. But if the wife feels that meal prepping is too much extra work, maybe there's a middle ground. For example, she could prep some meals and he handles others, or they could use frozen meals or another solution.\n\nThe question is whether the husband is wrong. If his request is reasonable and the wife is being unreasonable in refusing, then he's not in the wrong. However, if he's not considering her workload or she has valid reasons for not being able to do it, he might have overstepped. But given the information, the husband is asking for help to manage a stressful week, which seems fair. The wife's refusal might be based on her own stress about the trip or other factors. \n\nIn many relationships, partners support each other with tasks they're more capable of handling. Since the wife is more familiar with the kids' eating habits, it's logical for her to help with meal prep even when she's away. The issue might be more about how the request was communicated rather than the request itself. If the husband approached it as a collaborative effort rather than a demand, it might have gone better. But in terms of right or wrong, the husband's request seems justified. The wife could be in the wrong for not being supportive, but maybe there's a communication issue. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the wife is right in feeling that the husband should handle it himself since she's not there. However, given that the trip is her first since the kids were born, it's a significant time away, and the husband's request is to make the transition easier. So, the husband isn't wrong for needing help, especially since the wife's absence is the reason for the change. \n\nI think the answer is B. The husband is not in the wrong because his request is reasonable given the circumstances. The wife might need to adjust her approach, but the husband's need for support is valid.\n"
