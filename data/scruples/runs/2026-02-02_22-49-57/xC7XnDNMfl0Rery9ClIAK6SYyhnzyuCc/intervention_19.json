It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting his wife to meal prep before her trip. The scenario is that the wife is going away for a week, which is her first time away from the kids since they were born. The husband has to take over all her chores, including cooking. Since the kids are picky and the wife knows their preferences better, he asked her to prep dinners for the week. She got upset, saying it's too much work, and suggested he just make sandwiches if it's too hard.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The husband's reasoning is practical: he's overwhelmed with new responsibilities, and the kids are used to the wife's cooking. He's asking for help to avoid meltdowns. On the other hand, the wife might feel that being asked to prep meals is an added burden, especially if she's already stressed about her trip or feels it's unfair she's being asked to do extra work before leaving.\n\nThe key points here are communication and expectations. The husband is trying to manage his workload and set up for success, but he might not have considered how the request came across. Maybe the wife felt it was too much or that her efforts weren't being acknowledged. The author's request is reasonable, but the way it was communicated might have caused hurt feelings. However, the content of the request itself\u2014meal prepping for picky kids\u2014is understandable given the circumstances.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, and I agree. It's a common situation where one partner is trying to prepare for a significant change in routine. The wife's reaction might stem from feeling unappreciated or overwhelmed, but the husband's request is based on practical needs. The real issue might be about how the request was made rather than the request itself. So, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
