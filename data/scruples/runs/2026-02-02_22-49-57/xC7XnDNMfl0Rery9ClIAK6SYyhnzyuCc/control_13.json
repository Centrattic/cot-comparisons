It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a wife going on a trip and the husband asking her to meal prep before she leaves. The husband feels it's reasonable because he's not as familiar with the kids' preferences and wants to avoid meltdowns. The wife got upset, saying it's too much work and suggested he just make sandwiches if it's too hard.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the roles here. The wife usually handles cooking, which the husband acknowledges. He's taking on her chores for a week, so he's asking her to help out by prepping meals. The key points are the wife's responsibilities versus the husband's request. The user wants to know if the husband is wrong for making this request.\n\nThe husband's reasoning is that he's not as experienced with the kids' food preferences, leading to potential meltdowns. He's asking her to do something before she leaves, which is a common practice like meal prepping. The wife, however, feels it's too much work and is upset. But she's the one going away, so maybe it's fair to ask her to help by prepping before she leaves, especially since she's more familiar with the kids' needs.\n\nThe wife's refusal might stem from stress or feeling overwhelmed, but the husband's request is practical. Meal prepping before a trip is a common strategy to ease the burden when someone else is taking over. Since the wife isn't there during the trip, the prep work is done before she leaves. The husband isn't asking her to do the cooking during the trip but to prepare in advance. That seems reasonable because it's a proactive way to manage the situation. The wife's alternative suggestion (sandwiches) might not be sufficient for picky kids, leading to the husband's concern about meltdowns.\n\nSo, considering all that, the husband's request is logical and not unreasonable. The wife's reaction might be valid if the prep is too time-consuming, but since the husband is asking her to do it before her trip, it's her responsibility to manage her time accordingly. Therefore, the husband isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B (No).\n"
