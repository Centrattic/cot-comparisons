It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting his wife to meal prep before her trip.\n\nSo the situation is that the wife is going on a week-long trip, her first since the kids were born. The husband will be handling all the chores and cooking alone. Normally, the wife does the cooking, and she knows the kids' preferences better. The husband asks her to prep meals for the week so it's easier for him. The wife gets upset, thinking it's too much work, and suggests he just make sandwiches if it's too hard. The husband argues that it's fair since she's going away, and he doesn't want the kids to have meltdowns over unfamiliar food.\n\nFirst, I need to assess both sides. The husband's request seems reasonable. He's taking on extra responsibility by handling all the chores alone. Since the wife is more familiar with the kids' food preferences, asking her to prep meals could be a practical solution to avoid stress and ensure the kids eat well. The husband's concern about meltdowns is valid, especially if the kids are picky.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might feel that being asked to prep meals is an added burden, especially if she's already stressed about the trip. Maybe she feels that the husband should handle it himself, or she might have other commitments. However, the husband isn't asking for her to do something she's not already doing in normal circumstances; he's just shifting the timing of her usual responsibilities. Since she's going on a trip, which is a temporary change, prepping meals might be a way to share the load temporarily.\n\nThe key points here are mutual understanding and compromise. The husband's request is about preparing for a challenging week, and the wife's reaction might stem from feeling it's too much. But the husband isn't in the wrong for wanting to ask her to help in a way that leverages her strengths. The wife's response of \"just make sandwiches\" might not be helpful if the kids are used to different meals. The husband's reasoning is practical, aiming to maintain stability for the kids during his solo parenting week.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
