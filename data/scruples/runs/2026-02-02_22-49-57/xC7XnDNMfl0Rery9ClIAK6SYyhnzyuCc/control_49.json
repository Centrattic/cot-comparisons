It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is wrong. The situation is that the man is asking his wife to meal prep for the week she's away so he can handle the kids and chores by himself. The wife is upset and refuses, saying it's too much work, and suggests he can make sandwiches instead.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The wife is going on her first trip since the kids were born, so the husband is dealing with all the responsibilities alone. Cooking is her responsibility, and she knows the kids' preferences better. He wants her to prep meals for the week before she leaves. She's upset because it's too much work. He's worried about the kids' meltdowns if they don't get their usual food.\n\nNow, is he in the wrong? Let's break it down. He's asking for help that seems reasonable given the circumstances. Meal prepping can save time and stress, especially for someone who's not used to cooking for the family. The wife is the one who usually handles cooking and knows the kids' needs better. By having her prep, he's trying to make his week easier. However, she's taking on the trip, which might be stressful for her too. Maybe she's already preparing a lot else for her trip and adding meal prep is too much.\n\nBut is his request unfair? He's not asking her to do it during her trip, just before she leaves. It's a week's worth of dinners, which might take a day or two of her time. If she's capable and it's within her capacity, maybe it's reasonable. However, she's clearly upset, so maybe he didn't consider her workload or stress levels. Maybe he should have offered to help with the prep or adjusted expectations.\n\nOn the other hand, he's just trying to manage the household during her absence. It's understandable he wants to avoid meltdowns. The wife's suggestion of sandwiches might not be ideal, and he's trying to maintain consistency. So, is he wrong? It's a bit of a grey area. If his request was made in a respectful way and he's considering her workload, maybe not. But if he's being selfish or not considering her stress, then maybe yes. However, from the scenario, he seems reasonable, trying to make things easier for himself, which is normal. The wife's reaction might be over the top. \n\nI think the key here is whether the request was reasonable. Meal prepping is a common way to help someone. Since she's the one who knows the kids' preferences, it makes sense. Unless she has an overwhelming workload, he's not wrong. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
