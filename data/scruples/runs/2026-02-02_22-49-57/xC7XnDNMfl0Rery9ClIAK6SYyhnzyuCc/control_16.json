I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip.\n\nFirst, the situation: The wife is going on a week-long trip, the first time since the kids were born. The husband is taking over all her chores, including cooking. The kids are picky, and the wife knows their preferences better. He asked her to prep meals for the week. She got upset, saying it's too much work and offered sandwiches instead. He feels she should do it since she's leaving, but she's not happy about it.\n\nSo, the question is whether the husband is in the wrong. \n\nLet me break down the factors. The husband has a valid reason: the kids are picky, he's not as experienced, and he's already taking on extra chores. He's trying to manage his workload and avoid meltdowns. On the other hand, the wife is being asked to prepare meals for an entire week, which could be time-consuming and maybe stressful, especially since she's about to leave. She might feel overburdened, even if the trip is for a good reason.\n\nIs asking her to prep meals unreasonable? Well, it's a week's worth, which is a lot. Maybe she's already preparing for her trip, packing, etc., so adding meal prep might not be feasible. But the husband's request is to make things easier for him during her absence. The wife's response seems dismissive, suggesting sandwiches, which might not be suitable for the kids. \n\nThe key points here are mutual understanding and communication. The husband's request is to ease his transition, but the wife might feel that the timing is bad. It's possible that the husband didn't consider her capacity to handle the prep, especially if she's already busy. However, the wife's reaction might be too harsh if the request is within reason. \n\nIn many relationships, partners support each other by covering responsibilities. The husband is asking for help in advance, which is proactive. The wife's refusal might stem from not wanting to take on extra work before her trip, which is understandable. However, the husband's need to manage the household is also a valid concern. \n\nIt's possible that the husband isn't in the wrong because he's trying to plan ahead. But the wife's feelings are valid too. The answer might depend on the balance between their expectations and communication. Since the wife is the one refusing and getting upset, maybe the husband isn't wrong in making a reasonable request. However, if the prep is too much, maybe he should have asked for something else. But given the information, the husband's position seems reasonable. So the answer might be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
