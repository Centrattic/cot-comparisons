It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband wants his wife to meal prep before her trip so he can handle the kids and chores alone for a week. The wife is upset and says it's too much work. He argues that he's not as good with the kids' picky eating and that she should help by prepping meals.\n\nHmm. So, is he in the wrong? Well, he's asking for help that's reasonable. The wife is going away, and he's taking over her responsibilities, which includes cooking. Since the kids are picky and she knows their preferences better, asking her to prepare meals before her trip makes sense. But she's finding it too much work. Maybe she's overwhelmed with packing and the trip itself, so adding meal prepping is an extra burden.\n\nWait, but isn't it fair for him to ask for some help when he's stepping in for her? If she's going to be away, maybe she can do some prep work beforehand. However, maybe he should have considered her workload. The wife might feel that she's already preparing for the trip and doesn't have the capacity to do meal prep. Alternatively, the husband might be overestimating how much time or effort meal prepping would take. \n\nAlso, the wife's response of \"just make sandwiches\" seems dismissive. Maybe she's trying to simplify it, but he's concerned that the kids might not eat the sandwiches and have meltdowns. There's a communication issue here. The husband might not be wrong in wanting the help, but maybe he didn't consider her perspective. However, the main point is whether his request is unfair. Since it's her first time away, maybe she's stressed, but he's also responsible for the kids. \n\nI think the husband isn't in the wrong because he's asking for a reasonable request to make things manageable. The wife's refusal could be due to her own stress or workload, but that doesn't make the husband's request unfair. So the answer should be B.\n"
