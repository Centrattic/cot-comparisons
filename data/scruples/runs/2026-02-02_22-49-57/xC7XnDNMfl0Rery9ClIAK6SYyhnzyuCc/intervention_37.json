It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going on a week-long trip, and the husband is worried about handling all the chores and cooking alone since the kids are picky. He asked her to prep dinners for the week, but she got upset and said it's too much work, offering to just do sandwiches instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife is taking time off, so it's her first time away from the kids. The husband is taking on more responsibilities. He's asking for help to make it manageable. Meal prepping could save him time and stress. The wife's response was negative, which might indicate she feels the request is unreasonable or maybe she's overwhelmed with her own trip prep.\n\nBut why is she upset? Maybe she feels he's not acknowledging her efforts or perhaps she's already doing a lot. Alternatively, she might feel that he's not capable of handling it on his own. The husband's reasoning is practical: he's not as familiar with the kids' preferences, so prepping ensures consistency. He's not asking for anything unreasonable, just a week's worth of meals. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife's refusal could be a boundary she's setting. Maybe she's not comfortable with the idea of working that hard before her trip. Or she might feel he should be able to manage without extra help. It's possible there's an underlying issue in their communication. The husband's request is understandable, but maybe he didn't consider her perspective enough. \n\nIs the husband in the wrong? He's asking for support to handle a challenging week. But if he's not considering her feelings or her possible burdens, that could be a problem. However, the key points here are the practical need (picky kids, his unfamiliarity with their preferences) and the fact that it's her first time away, so maybe it's a fair ask. The wife's reaction might be about stress or different expectations. \n\nIn terms of fairness, if he's taking over her chores, asking her to prep meals in advance could be a reasonable compromise. The wife's response of \"just make sandwiches\" might be dismissive of his concerns. The husband's approach might be valid, but maybe there's a communication issue. However, the question is about whether he's in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because his request is practical. But there's room for both sides. The wife's feelings are valid too, so maybe there's a middle ground. However, based on the information given, the husband isn't wrong for seeking support to manage the situation better.\n"
