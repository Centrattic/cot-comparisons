      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting his wife to meal prep before her trip. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe wife is going on a week-long trip, her first since the kids were born. The husband is handling everything alone, including work and chores. Cooking is typically the wife's responsibility, and the kids are picky eaters. The husband knows the wife knows their preferences better, so he asks her to prep dinners for the week. She gets upset, says it's too much work, and suggests he can just make sandwiches if needed. The husband feels it's fair to ask since she's taking the trip.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the fairness of the request. The husband is asking the wife to do something that's outside her normal routine but before her trip. Meal prepping for a week might be a significant task, especially if she's already packing and preparing for her trip. However, the husband's reasoning is that he's not used to cooking for the kids and wants to avoid stress and potential meltdowns. \n\nIs it reasonable to ask someone to do something that's part of their usual responsibilities when they're about to leave? The wife is the primary cook, so prepping meals in advance could help the transition. But she's also going away, so maybe she's already stressed about the trip. The key here is whether the request is reasonable given the circumstances.\n\nThe wife's reaction is important. She finds it too much work. Perhaps the timing is an issue. If she's already busy with her own preparations, adding meal prep might be overwhelming. The husband's alternative of sandwiches is a backup, but he prefers the wife's cooking for consistency with the kids. \n\nI need to consider communication. Did the husband give her enough notice? Was the request made in a respectful manner? The user mentions that the husband asked her to prep, which she found unreasonable. Maybe there's a misunderstanding about how much work it entails. Also, the husband might not realize the strain it could put on her before her trip.\n\nAnother angle: taking on her responsibilities while she's away is part of the deal. But asking her to do extra work right before her trip could be seen as unfair. However, the husband is trying to ensure the kids' needs are met, which is understandable. \n\nI think the husband isn't in the wrong because he's trying to manage household responsibilities during her absence. However, he might need to adjust his approach. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer would depend on whether the request is fair. Since the wife is the primary cook, asking her to prep meals for the week when she's going to be away might be fair. The issue might be more about the wife's capacity to handle the prep before her trip, but the husband's intention is reasonable. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
