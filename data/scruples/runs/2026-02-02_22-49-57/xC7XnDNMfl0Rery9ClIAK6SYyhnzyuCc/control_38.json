      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the wife is going on a trip for a week, and the husband wants her to pre-make the dinners for the kids during that time. The wife is upset because she thinks that's too much work, and he's frustrated because he's worried about dealing with picky eaters and potential meltdowns.\n\nFirst, I need to look at both sides. The husband's reasoning is that he's not used to cooking because his wife usually does it. The kids are picky, and she knows their preferences better. So, asking her to prep meals ahead of time would make his week easier. On the other hand, the wife is going away for the first time since the kids were born, so maybe she's already stressed about that. She might feel that prepping meals adds extra work before her trip, which could be tiring or time-consuming. She suggests that if it's too hard, he can just make sandwiches, which seems like a simpler solution but might not meet the kids' usual standards.\n\nThe question is whether the husband is in the wrong for asking her to do the meal prep. The key factors here are communication and consideration. The husband's request is based on his need for support during her absence, which is understandable. However, the wife might feel that the request is unreasonable given the timing and her own responsibilities. It's possible that the husband didn't consider how much work it would be for her or that she might already be busy packing or preparing for her trip. \n\nAlso, there's a bit of a mismatch in expectations. He wants her to take on more work before her trip, but she might feel that she's giving up her family time to go on this trip, and now he's adding another task. The wife's reaction might stem from feeling that her efforts aren't being recognized or that her own needs during the trip aren't being considered. \n\nThe husband's alternative plan of making sandwiches is practical, but he's concerned about the kids' reactions. However, maybe there's a middle ground. Perhaps prepping a few meals instead of all of them, or involving the kids in simple food prep, or using frozen meals. The main issue here is whether the request is fair. \n\nSince the wife is the one who is going away, the husband might expect her to help set things up before she leaves. But if the prep work is too much, it could be seen as an unreasonable request. The answer might depend on the usual workload and how they typically share responsibilities. If the wife usually handles cooking and the husband is now taking over, maybe he needs to adjust his expectations. \n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? It's possible that he is not in the wrong because he's trying to prepare for a challenging week. However, he could have been more considerate of his wife's perspective and maybe offered to handle some of the prep work together or found another solution. The fact that the wife is upset suggests that the request might have been a bit much, especially if it's an additional burden on top of her trip preparations. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the husband is in the right because he's asking for help in a way that he's used to, and it's reasonable to expect his wife to assist before leaving. But the key is whether the request is fair given the circumstances. Since the wife is taking time away, perhaps the husband should have been more flexible or considered other options. \n\nIn conclusion, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because the husband's request is based on his need for support, but he might need to communicate better and find a compromise. However, the wife's reaction is valid if the prep work is too much for her. The answer could be B, but there's a nuance here.\n"
