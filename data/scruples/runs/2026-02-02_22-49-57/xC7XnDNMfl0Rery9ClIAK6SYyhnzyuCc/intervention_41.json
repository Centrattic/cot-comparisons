It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the question is in the wrong. The scenario involves a husband asking his wife to meal prep for a week while she's away on a trip. The wife is upset about it, and he's wondering if he's being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife is going on her first trip away from the kids, and the husband has to take over her chores. Cooking is usually her responsibility, and the kids are picky. The husband wants her to prep meals so it's easier for him. The wife feels it's too much work and suggests making sandwiches instead.\n\nI should think about the fairness of the request. The husband is asking for help before she leaves, which is logical. But the wife might feel that the trip is her time to relax, and the prep work adds to her stress. However, the husband's reasoning is about managing the kids' needs and reducing his own stress. \n\nThere's a balance between shared responsibilities and individual capacities. The husband isn't asking for anything more than what's necessary for the kids, and since the wife knows their preferences better, it makes sense. But the wife's refusal could indicate she feels overburdened, even if it's for a week before her trip. \n\nI should also consider communication. Did the husband express his needs clearly? He mentions not wanting meltdowns from the kids, which is a valid concern. The wife's response might stem from her own stress about the trip or other factors not mentioned. \n\nIn terms of fairness, asking someone to do something reasonable before leaving could be justified, especially if it eases the person staying behind. But maybe the husband didn't account for her workload before the trip. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nI think the husband isn't in the wrong because he's trying to plan and reduce stress for the family. The wife's reaction might be valid, but the request itself is reasonable. So the answer is B.\n"
