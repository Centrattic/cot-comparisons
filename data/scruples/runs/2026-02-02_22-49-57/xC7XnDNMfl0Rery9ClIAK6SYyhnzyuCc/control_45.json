It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is the wife is going on a week-long trip, and the husband is asking her to meal prep for the week so he can handle cooking for the kids. She's upset because she thinks it's too much work. The husband argues that it's reasonable since she's the one who knows the kids' preferences better and he's worried about handling everything alone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband has a valid point about needing help with chores and cooking when she's away. It's his first time managing everything alone, and the kids are picky eaters. Meal prepping would make things easier for him. On the other hand, the wife is going on a trip, which is a time for her to have a break. Asking her to prep meals might feel like an added burden, especially if she's already stressed about the trip or if she doesn't have the time or energy to do it.\n\nThe key here is whether the request is reasonable. The husband isn't asking her to do something while she's away, but before she leaves. If she has the time and ability to prep before her trip, then it's a fair request. However, if she's already busy with packing or other pre-trip tasks, maybe the timing isn't right. Also, communication is important. The husband asked her, and she felt it was too much. Maybe there's a middle ground, like prepping a few meals instead of all, or adjusting the menu to something simpler. \n\nThe wife's response of suggesting sandwiches might be a way to downplay the situation, but it also shows she's trying to be helpful in her own way. However, the husband's concern about the kids' meltdowns is valid too. He needs consistency for the kids. \n\nI think the husband isn't in the wrong because he's asking for help to manage a challenging week. But it's also important for him to listen to her concerns and find a compromise. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and he's making a reasonable request based on his needs, the answer is probably B (No), he's not in the wrong. The wife's reaction is valid, but the request is understandable given the circumstances.\n"
