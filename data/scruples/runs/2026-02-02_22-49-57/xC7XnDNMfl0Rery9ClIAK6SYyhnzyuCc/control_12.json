It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the wife is going on a week-long trip, and the husband is asking her to meal prep for the kids during her absence. He's worried about handling everything alone, especially since cooking is her responsibility and she knows the kids' preferences better. She got upset and said that's too much work, suggesting he just make sandwiches if it's too hard.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the reasons given. The husband is asking for help to manage without the wife being there. Meal prepping might be a way to reduce stress for him, given that the kids are picky. But the wife is refusing because it's too much work. Maybe she's already preparing for her trip and feels that adding meal prep is too much. \n\nThe question is whether asking her to meal prep is unfair. The husband argues it's reasonable since she's going to be away, but the wife feels it's an added burden. It's about dividing responsibilities. Normally, cooking is her role, so asking her to handle that aspect even when she's away might be seen as logical. However, she's already leaving the house, so maybe the extra task is too much. \n\nAlso, the wife's reaction is important. If she felt the request was unreasonable, maybe the husband didn't consider her workload or stress before the trip. But the husband is trying to prevent meltdowns from the kids over unfamiliar food. \n\nI think it's a balance between needing help and respecting each other's capacities. The husband isn't wrong in wanting to avoid problems, but maybe he didn't communicate the request sensitively. However, the wife's refusal is also valid if it's too much for her. Since the request is about preparing for the week, which is a common task, and he's trying to make it easier, maybe he's not in the wrong. But maybe he should have considered her feelings more. Hmm.\n"
