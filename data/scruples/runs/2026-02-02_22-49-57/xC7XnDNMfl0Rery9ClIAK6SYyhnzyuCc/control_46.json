It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post) is in the wrong for wanting his wife to meal prep before her trip.\n\nFirst, the situation: The wife is going on a week-long trip, her first since the kids were born. The husband will be handling everything alone, including work and chores. Cooking is normally the wife's job. The husband asks her to prep dinners for the week to make things easier for him, especially since the kids are picky and he's not as familiar with their preferences. The wife gets upset, says it's too much work, and suggests he just make sandwiches if it's too hard. The husband feels it's not unfair to ask since she's the one leaving, but he's worried about the kids' reactions if the food isn't right.\n\nSo, the key points here are about fairness and expectations. The husband is trying to manage his responsibilities without his wife's usual help. He's asking for her to do something that would make the transition easier for him. The wife is upset, maybe because she's already stressed about the trip, or perhaps she feels the request is unreasonable given her own workload.\n\nIs the husband in the wrong? Well, he's asking for help in preparation for the time she's away. It's reasonable to expect the wife to assist in setting him up for success during her absence. However, it's also possible that the wife might feel overburdened, especially if she's preparing for a trip herself. The question is whether the request is unfair. Since the wife is the one going away, and she's taking over the cooking duties, it's a way to split the load. If she's unwilling, maybe there's a communication issue or unspoken stress. But from the husband's perspective, he's trying to avoid a potential problem (kids' meltdowns) and is asking for help that's within her usual responsibilities. \n\nSo, the husband doesn't seem to be in the wrong. He's proactive and trying to manage the situation. The wife's reaction might indicate other issues, but the request itself is fair. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
