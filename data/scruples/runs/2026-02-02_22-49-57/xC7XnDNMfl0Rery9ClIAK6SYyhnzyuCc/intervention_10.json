It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going away for a week, and the husband is handling all the chores and cooking alone for the first time. The kids are picky eaters, and the wife is better at handling their preferences. He asked her to prep meals, but she got upset and offered an alternative of sandwiches.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the husband's perspective. He's asking for help because he's overwhelmed. The wife normally does the cooking, and since he's not as experienced, he's worried about the kids' reactions if he messes up. It's reasonable to want some support when taking on new responsibilities. Meal prepping could make his week easier, especially with the added stress of managing without her.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might feel that being asked to prep meals is an extra burden, especially if she's already preparing for her trip. Maybe she's tired or has other commitments. Her reaction could indicate that she feels overworked or that her needs aren't being considered. The husband's request might be seen as adding to her already busy schedule right before she leaves.\n\nBut the key here is the intention. The husband's goal is to manage the situation better, not to impose. He's trying to set himself up for success by using the wife's strengths. If she can do it without too much hassle, it's a win-win. However, if she's unable or unwilling, maybe there's a middle ground. The wife's alternative of sandwiches might not be ideal, but it's a valid compromise. The husband's insistence on prepping might not be fair if it's causing her stress. But he's not forcing her; he's asking. \n\nIt's also important to consider communication. The husband could have discussed the request earlier to avoid last-minute stress. Maybe there's a misunderstanding about the workload. The wife might feel that the husband isn't taking on his fair share, leading to her frustration.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the husband's request isn't unreasonable. He's acknowledging his limitations and seeking help. However, the wife's response shows she's feeling overwhelmed. The real issue might be about balancing each other's needs and finding a solution that works for both. The husband isn't necessarily in the wrong for asking, but there's room for better communication and compromise. The answer would likely be that he's not in the wrong because his request is practical and based on the situation, even if the wife's reaction is valid.\n"
