It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author wants his wife to meal prep for the week she's away, but she's upset about it. The author argues that since he's not as familiar with the kids' preferences, he needs the prepped meals to avoid meltdowns. He's taking on her chores for a week, so he's asking her to help by prepping.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's reasoning is practical: he's managing a lot without her, and the kids are picky. Meal prepping could reduce stress. But his wife might feel it's too much, especially if she's already stressed about the trip. Maybe she's overwhelmed with packing or other tasks. Did he consider her workload? The author says it's her first time away, so maybe she's already under pressure. \n\nIs asking her to prep fair? It's a week-long trip, so maybe a week's worth of meals is a lot. The author assumes she can handle it, but he doesn't mention discussing the amount or if he's offering to help. Maybe she's not the best at meal prepping, or it's a new task for her. Also, the author is willing to make sandwiches, but she suggests that as an alternative, which might not be ideal for the kids. \n\nCommunication is key here. The author's request is to make things easier, but the wife's reaction suggests she feels it's too much. Perhaps he didn't consider her perspective. Maybe he should have asked earlier or discussed alternatives. Alternatively, he's in a tough spot managing everything alone. \n\nIs he in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. He's trying to prepare, but maybe he overestimated her capacity or didn't consider her stress. But he's also in a position where he's taking on more, so asking for help isn't unreasonable. The answer might hinge on whether the request was reasonable given the circumstances. Since the wife got upset, maybe the author should have been more flexible, but he's not necessarily at fault. His intentions are good. So, likely not in the wrong, answer B.\n"
