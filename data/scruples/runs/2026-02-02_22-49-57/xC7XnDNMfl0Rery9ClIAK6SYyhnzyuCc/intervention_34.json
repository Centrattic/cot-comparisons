It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their wife to meal prep before her trip. So first, I need to understand the situation. The wife is going away for a week, the first time since the kids were born. The husband is worried about handling all the chores and cooking by himself. The kids are picky eaters, and the wife usually cooks, so he asks her to prep the dinners for the week. She gets upset, saying it's too much work and offers sandwiches instead.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants my opinion. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nHmm. Let me break it down. The husband is in a stressful situation, handling more responsibilities alone. He's asking for help to avoid meltdowns with the kids. Meal prepping might be a reasonable request to reduce his stress. However, the wife is taking the trip, which is a time for her to be away. She might feel overwhelmed by the request, especially if she's already planning a trip. Maybe the husband could have considered other solutions, like freezing meals or involving the kids in simple prep. But is the request fair? He's asking her to do something before she leaves to make his week easier. Since she's not there during the week, she's still contributing by prepping. \n\nWait, but why is the wife upset? She might feel that the husband isn't being supportive or that the request is too much. Maybe he didn't consider the timing\u2014preparing a week's worth of meals might be a lot for her right before her trip. Also, she's already going to be away, so maybe she's not in the right mindset for extra work. The husband's intention is good, but the wife's reaction suggests it's a sensitive issue. \n\nIs it reasonable to ask for meal prepping? It depends on their usual dynamic. If the wife normally handles cooking and the husband is taking over, maybe it's fair to ask for some help. But if she's already stressed about the trip or if the request adds to her workload before leaving, that could be an issue. The husband's concern is valid, but maybe he should have discussed it earlier or found a compromise. \n\nThe key points are mutual support and communication. If the wife feels her needs aren't being considered, that's a problem. However, the husband isn't wrong for wanting to make things easier. It's a balance. In this case, the husband's request seems reasonable, but the wife's reaction is also valid. So, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. The answer might be B (no), because it's a reasonable request given the circumstances, but there's room for better communication.\n"
