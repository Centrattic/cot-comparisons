It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for wanting his wife to meal prep before her trip.\n\nFirst, the situation: The husband is asking his wife to prepare meals for the week she's away. The wife is upset because she thinks it's too much work. The husband's reasoning is that the kids are picky, and since she does most of the cooking, he wants to avoid meltdowns when she's not there. He's taking over her chores, working, and handling the kids alone.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Let's break it down. He's asking for help because he's overwhelmed. Meal prepping isn't unusual for trips. The wife is going away, so she has time to do it before leaving. The husband is trying to manage household responsibilities, which is reasonable. The wife's response seems dismissive, offering sandwiches instead, which might not be what the kids are used to. The husband's request is about maintaining routine for the kids and reducing his stress. \n\nBut maybe there's an angle I'm missing. Did he ask her to do extra work when she's already preparing to travel? Maybe she's stressed about the trip. Or perhaps the husband should have offered to compensate her in some way, like handling more chores when she's back. However, the wife is the one who normally does the cooking, so it's logical that she knows the kids' preferences better. \n\nThe key points are: He's asking her to prep before her trip, which is when she's available. He's not asking her to do it during her trip. The request is to make things easier for him when she's gone. The wife is upset, but her solution of sandwiches might not be ideal. \n\nI think the husband isn't in the wrong. He's planning ahead to manage responsibilities. The wife's reaction might be about the effort required, but his reasoning is valid. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
