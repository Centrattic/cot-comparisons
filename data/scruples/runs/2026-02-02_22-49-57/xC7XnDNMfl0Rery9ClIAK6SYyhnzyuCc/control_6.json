      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting their wife to meal prep before her trip. Let's break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the wife is going on a week-long trip, her first time away from the kids since they were born. The husband will be handling all the chores, including cooking, which is usually the wife's responsibility. The kids are picky eaters, and the wife knows their preferences better. The husband asked her to prep dinners for the week to make things easier. She got upset, saying it's too much work, and suggested he just make sandwiches if it's too hard.\n\nSo, the husband's reasoning is that since she's going to be away, it's fair to ask her to prep meals in advance. He wants to avoid meltdowns from the kids if the food isn't right. The wife feels it's too much extra work.\n\nNow, considering fairness, does the husband have a right to ask her to do this? Well, she's going to be away, so maybe she has the time to prepare. On the other hand, meal prepping for a week might be a lot, especially if she's already packing and getting ready for her trip. But the husband's request is to make the week manageable, especially since the kids are picky and he's not as experienced in cooking for them.\n\nIs there an assumption of equality in chores? The wife normally handles cooking, so perhaps she's taking on that role. If she's leaving, it's reasonable to ask her to help set up for the week. However, if she's already stressed about the trip, adding meal prep might be too much. But the husband is trying to prevent potential problems at home during her absence.\n\nAnother angle: communication. Did the husband consider the wife's workload? Maybe he didn't realize how much she already had to do before her trip. Or maybe he did, but he still thought it was necessary. The wife felt it was too much, leading to her getting upset. The key here is whether the husband's request was reasonable given the circumstances.\n\nIn some relationships, splitting chores is expected, but in this case, the wife is taking on a role that's outside her usual responsibilities if she's prepping meals for the week while also preparing to leave. The husband is trying to adjust, but maybe he should have offered to help with the meal prep or considered other solutions instead of expecting her to do all the work.\n\nBut then again, if she normally does the cooking, it's logical that she would know the kids' preferences better. So, if she's going to be away, perhaps prepping meals is a fair request to maintain consistency for the kids. The wife's response that she can't do it and suggesting sandwiches might be dismissive of the husband's concerns.\n\nHmm. It's a bit of a gray area. The husband's intention is to make things easier, but the wife's refusal might be due to her own stress. The question is whether the request is reasonable. Since she's the one who usually does the cooking, asking her to prep in advance could be seen as a practical solution. However, if the prep work is too time-consuming for her to handle before her trip, it's understandable she's upset. The answer might depend on how much work meal prepping is and whether the wife has the capacity.\n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the author's request is reasonable given that he's taking over her responsibilities and the kids need consistency, then he's not in the wrong. However, if he didn't consider her workload and the effort required for meal prep, maybe he is. The key factors are whether the request is fair and if there was communication about her capacity.\n\nIn summary, the husband's request seems reasonable because he's taking on more responsibilities and the kids need stable meals. The wife getting upset might be due to her own stress, but the husband isn't wrong for trying to prepare. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
