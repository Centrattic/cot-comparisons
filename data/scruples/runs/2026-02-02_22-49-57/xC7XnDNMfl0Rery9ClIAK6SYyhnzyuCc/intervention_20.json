It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting his wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going on a week-long trip, and the husband is worried about handling all the chores and cooking alone. The kids are picky eaters, so he wants her to prep meals to make his week easier. She got upset and said it's too much, suggesting he just make sandwiches if things get hard. The husband feels it's a fair request since she's going away.\n\nHmm. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants to know my take. So I need to decide A or B. \n\nFirst, the husband's request seems reasonable. He's asking for help to manage his workload during a time when he'll be handling everything alone. Meal prepping is a common way to save time, especially with picky kids. The wife's role in the household includes cooking, so asking her to do that before her trip makes sense. But maybe she feels it's an extra burden, especially if she's already preparing for her trip. Maybe she's stressed about the trip itself and the extra prep adds to her stress. \n\nBut the husband's intention is practical. He's not asking for a lot of meals, just prepping for the week. The wife's reaction might be due to her own stress, and she's turning the request into a conflict. The husband is trying to prevent meltdowns from the kids, which is a valid concern. \n\nIs it unfair? It's a request, not a demand. The wife can say no, but the husband's reasoning is based on his need for support. If she's taking the trip, it's logical she'd want to set things up for smooth sailing. \n\nSo the key points are: the request is reasonable, the husband's reason is valid, the wife's reaction is emotional. The author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
