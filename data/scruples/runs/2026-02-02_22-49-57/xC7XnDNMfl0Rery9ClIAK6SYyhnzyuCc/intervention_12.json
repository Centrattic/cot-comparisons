It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (ITA) is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going away for a week, and the husband will be handling all the chores, including cooking, which is normally her responsibility. The kids are picky, and the author wants to avoid meltdowns by having the wife pre-make dinners. She refused, saying it's too much work and offered an alternative.\n\nFirst, the author's reasoning: He's taking over her half of the chores, which includes cooking. Since the kids are picky and he's not as experienced, he wants to minimize stress by having prepped meals. It's a reasonable request because he's managing everything else alone. The wife's response is that it's too much work, but she's the one leaving, so she's still responsible for those meals. The husband is asking for help to make his week manageable.\n\nBut wait, maybe the wife is right in feeling that prep is too much. If she's already preparing for her trip, adding meal prepping could be an extra burden. However, the husband is handling the rest, so it's a balance. The key points are whether the request is fair given the circumstances. The wife taking a week off from childcare means she's not around to help, so asking her to do prep before leaving isn't unreasonable. He's trying to set himself up for success. The wife's alternative of sandwiches is simplistic but not necessarily helpful if the kids are used to more varied meals.\n\nThe author's position is that he's not in the wrong, which makes sense. He's trying to manage responsibilities and avoid chaos. The wife's refusal might stem from stress or overwork, but the request isn't excessive. So, the answer is B: No, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
