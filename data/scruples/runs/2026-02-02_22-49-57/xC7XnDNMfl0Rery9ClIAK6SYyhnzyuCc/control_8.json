It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author wants his wife to meal prep before her trip, but she refused and got upset. The author feels it's reasonable because he's not as experienced with the kids' eating habits and he's worried about meltdowns. The wife thinks it's too much work.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the dynamics here. The wife is going on a trip, which is her first time away from the kids since they were born. The author is taking over her chores, including cooking, which is typically her responsibility. The kids are picky eaters, and the wife knows their preferences better because she's cooked more. The author asked her to prep meals for the week, but she refused, leading to conflict.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, he's asking for help that he believes is necessary because he's not confident in handling the cooking alone. But the wife might feel that the request is excessive, especially if she's already stressed about the trip. Maybe she's overwhelmed with the idea of meal prepping on top of her own packing and trip plans. Also, the wife might feel that the author should be able to manage without her help, perhaps expecting him to step up more in her absence.\n\nBut then, the author has a valid point about the kids' picky eating. If the kids are used to specific meals that the wife prepares, changing to something else could cause meltdowns. The author is trying to prevent that by asking the wife to do what she's already good at. However, if the wife feels it's too much work, maybe the author should consider alternative solutions instead of expecting her to prep, like figuring out some kid-friendly easy recipes or involving the kids in simple meal prep.\n\nAnother angle is the balance of responsibilities. If cooking is her responsibility, then asking her to prep before she leaves might be fair. But if he's supposed to be taking over her duties while she's away, maybe he should have taken the initiative to learn or plan ahead without expecting her to do extra work. The wife's refusal could indicate that she feels overburdened, and the author might be not considering her stress about the trip.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author's intention is to make things easier for himself, which is understandable. But he should also consider his wife's perspective. Maybe there's a middle ground, like her prepping a few meals instead of all, or them discussing practical solutions. The key here is communication and mutual understanding. If the author didn't consider her feelings and the added stress on her part, that might make him the asshole. On the other hand, if the wife is being unreasonable and not helping with the transition, then the author might be in the right.\n\nI think the answer depends on whether the request is reasonable given the circumstances. Meal prepping for a week can be time-consuming. The author could have asked for some help without expecting her to do all the prep. Maybe a compromise would be better. Since the author is asking for her to do something that's already part of her responsibilities, but she's not in the house to do it, maybe it's a bit much. Alternatively, the author should have planned ahead to handle meals without her help. So, there's a bit of both sides. However, the wife's reaction being \"too much work\" and the author not offering any alternatives might tip the balance. The author might be in the wrong for not considering her workload and not offering to handle more himself. Alternatively, his concern is valid. Hmm.\n"
