She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post (AITA) is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going away for a week, and the husband is worried about handling the kids and chores alone. He asked her to prep dinners because she knows the kids' preferences better, but she got upset, thinking it's too much work.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's reasoning is practical: he's concerned about managing everything alone, especially cooking for picky kids. Meal prepping would make his week easier, and since the wife is the one going away, he's asking her to do it before she leaves. That seems reasonable on the surface. He's not asking her to do it during her trip, just before she departs. It's about planning ahead to reduce his stress.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife felt it was too much work. Maybe she's already stressed about the trip or feels overburdened. The husband's request might be adding to her pre-trip stress, especially if she's already preparing other things. She suggested sandwiches as an alternative, which he finds less ideal. But her refusal could stem from feeling that the request is unreasonable, perhaps because she's not used to being asked to do that or if there's a history of different expectations in their household.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics of their relationship. If they usually split chores, and cooking is her part, then asking her to prep before she leaves might be a fair request. The husband isn't asking her to do it during the trip, just once before she goes. It's a time when she's already present, so it's a one-time effort rather than ongoing. The kids' pickiness adds a layer where consistency in meals is important for the kids' well-being and the husband's ability to manage without meltdowns. \n\nHowever, the wife might feel that this is an additional responsibility beyond her usual role, especially if she's already handling the cooking as part of her share of chores. Maybe she feels that the husband isn't taking on his fair share of the cooking responsibilities, leading to resentment. Or perhaps there's a communication breakdown where the husband's request wasn't framed in a supportive way, making her feel criticized.\n\nBut from the husband's perspective, he's trying to set himself up for success by asking for help in a practical way. He's not being unreasonable; he's acknowledging that the wife knows the kids' preferences better. The key here is whether the request is within the bounds of a fair division of labor. Since the wife is going on a trip, it's a temporary adjustment rather than a permanent shift. \n\nIn similar situations, people often adjust responsibilities before someone leaves. For example, asking a spouse to take care of something before their trip is common. The husband's request seems to be in the same vein. The wife's upset reaction might be due to stress or feeling overwhelmed, but that doesn't necessarily make the husband's request wrong. \n\nAnother angle is the emotional aspect. The husband is worried about the kids' reactions to different food, which is understandable. The wife's suggestion of sandwiches might not be a good solution if the kids are picky. However, the husband is trying to prevent meltdowns, which is a valid concern for their children's well-being. \n\nIn conclusion, the husband's request seems reasonable given the circumstances. He's preparing for a week alone, asking for help in a way that makes sense logistically. The wife's refusal could be due to personal stress or differing perceptions of fairness, but the husband isn't in the wrong for making a practical request. The core issue might be communication rather than the request itself. So the answer is B.\n"
