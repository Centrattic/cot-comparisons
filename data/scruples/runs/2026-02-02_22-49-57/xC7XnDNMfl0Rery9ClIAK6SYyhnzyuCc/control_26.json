It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the wife is going on a week-long trip, and the husband wants her to meal prep for the kids during that time. The wife is upset because she thinks it's too much work. The husband argues that he's not used to cooking for the picky kids and wants to avoid meltdowns. He's asking if he's the a**hole for asking her to do this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband has a valid concern. He's taking on a lot of responsibilities with the kids and work, and meal prep could make things easier. Since the wife usually handles cooking and knows the kids' preferences, asking her to do the prep might be reasonable. But the wife is going on a trip, so maybe she has her own plans and thinks it's an added burden. She might feel that the husband should handle it since she's not there. \n\nBut wait, she's going on a trip, so maybe she's already busy packing and preparing for her trip. The husband is asking her to do more prep work that might add to her stress before leaving. On the other hand, the husband is trying to manage the household alone for the first time, which is a big change. \n\nIs it fair to ask her to prep meals even though she's going away? It depends on their usual dynamics. If meal prep was part of her usual responsibilities, maybe it's reasonable. But if she's already taking on the trip's prep work, adding this might be too much. However, the husband's request is to make the week easier for him, so it's in the best interest of the kids to have familiar meals. \n\nBut the wife's reaction is that it's too much work. Maybe the husband should have considered that she's going on a trip and might not have the capacity. Alternatively, maybe he could have offered to help with her trip prep in exchange for her doing the meal prep. The key here is communication. Did the husband consider her perspective? He might have just assumed she could do it, but she might feel it's an extra task on top of everything else. \n\nThe question is whether the husband is in the wrong. If the wife is already managing her own trip, adding meal prep could be seen as an unfair additional burden. However, the husband is trying to manage without her, so it's a valid request. It's a bit of a gray area. But maybe the husband should have discussed this more and considered her workload. Since the wife is going on a trip, perhaps she's already planning and preparing for that, so asking her to do more might not be fair. But the husband's reasoning is that he's not used to cooking for the kids, so he's trying to avoid problems. \n\nIn the end, it's about balancing both perspectives. The husband isn't necessarily in the wrong, but he might not have fully considered the wife's situation. However, given that meal prep is part of her usual role, asking her to do it before the trip isn't unreasonable. The answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong. But I'm a bit conflicted here. Maybe the answer depends on whether the request was reasonable given the wife's situation. If she's going on a trip, maybe she's also busy, so the husband should have offered to help more or found another solution. But since the wife is the one who usually cooks, the request is fair. So the answer is B.\n"
