It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is at fault (AITA) for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation involves the wife going on a week-long trip, which is her first time away from the kids since they were born. The husband has to take over her chores, including cooking, which is usually the wife's responsibility.\n\nThe main points here are: the husband is overwhelmed with taking over cooking for the week, especially since the kids are picky and the wife knows their preferences better. He asked her to prep meals, but she was upset, thinking it's too much work. He's concerned about dealing with the kids' meltdowns if the food isn't what they're used to. He doesn't think it's unfair to ask her because she's going to be away for a week.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. The key factors here are communication and the reasonableness of the request. The husband is trying to prepare for a situation where he's taking on more responsibilities. Meal prepping could make his week easier and prevent potential issues with the kids. The wife, on the other hand, might feel that the request is adding extra work to her trip preparations, especially since she's already going away. However, the husband's request is understandable as he's trying to manage the household during her absence.\n\nIs the request unfair? It depends on the circumstances. If the wife has the capacity to prep meals without it being too burdensome, then it's a reasonable ask. However, if she's already stressed about the trip or has other commitments, asking for more work might not be fair. But the husband's intention is to make the week manageable, which is a valid concern. The fact that he's considering the kids' preferences and his own capacity to handle the cooking suggests he's trying to be responsible. The wife's reaction might stem from feeling that the request is an additional stressor she wasn't expecting.\n\nSo, the husband isn't in the wrong because he's trying to organize and prepare for the week. The wife's refusal might be due to her own stress or workload during the trip prep. The request itself is reasonable given the context. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
