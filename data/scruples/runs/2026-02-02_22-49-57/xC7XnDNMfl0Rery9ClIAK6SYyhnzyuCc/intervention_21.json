It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting his wife to meal prep before her trip. The main points are: the wife is going on a week-long trip, the author will be handling all the chores and cooking alone for the first time. The kids are picky eaters, and the wife knows their preferences better. The author asked her to prep meals, but she got upset, thinking it's too much work. He's worried about meltdowns from the kids if he can't cook what they're used to.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author's request is reasonable. Meal prepping for a week does take time, but the wife is going on a trip, so she's choosing to take a break. The author is trying to manage responsibilities during her absence. It's understandable he wants to avoid stress, especially with kids involved. However, the wife might feel that the request is adding extra work right before her trip. But since she's the one going away, maybe it's fair to ask her to handle the prep before leaving. On the other hand, if meal prepping is a lot, maybe the author should consider alternatives, like using a meal delivery service or freezing meals. But the author's reasoning is that he's not as adept at cooking for picky kids, so he's asking for help. The wife's response seems dismissive, suggesting sandwiches, which might not meet the kids' needs. \n\nIs the author wrong? It depends on the balance of responsibilities. If the couple usually shares chores, asking the wife to prep once before a trip might be reasonable. But if the wife feels overburdened, there might be underlying issues. However, the author's request seems practical. He's not asking her to do it while she's away but before. So, the answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong), but there's room for nuance. The key is whether the request is fair given the circumstances. The wife could also offer a compromise, but the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to prepare for a challenging week. So, B makes sense.\n"
