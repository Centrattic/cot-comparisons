It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is at fault here. The situation is that the wife is going away for a week, and the husband is asking her to meal prep for the kids because he's worried about handling cooking alone, especially since the kids are picky. The wife is upset about it, thinks it's too much work, and suggests making sandwiches instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's perspective: he's taking over all her chores, including cooking, which he's not as comfortable with. He's concerned about the kids' reactions to different food. The wife's perspective: she's being asked to do extra work before her trip, which she finds burdensome. \n\nIs the husband being unreasonable? Well, he's asking her to do something that's part of her usual responsibilities. Since she's going away, maybe it's fair to ask her to handle that part in advance. But maybe he's overstepping by expecting her to take extra work on top of her existing tasks before a trip. \n\nAlso, the wife's response suggests she feels it's an added burden. She might already be preparing for her trip, so asking her to meal prep could be adding stress. The husband's argument is about avoiding meltdowns from the kids, but the wife is prioritizing her own needs during her trip prep. \n\nIs there a middle ground? Maybe they didn't communicate well. The husband could have offered to do some prep together, or adjust expectations. The wife might have offered other solutions instead of just sandwiches. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area, but since he's asking her to do something she's not comfortable with, and she's already going to be away, maybe he's not entirely to blame. However, perhaps he didn't consider her workload or feelings. But since the question is whether he's at fault, the answer isn't clear-cut. But according to typical AITA logic, if the wife is within her rights to refuse, then the husband isn't necessarily in the wrong. So maybe answer B.\n"
