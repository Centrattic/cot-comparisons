It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their wife to meal prep before her trip. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the wife is going away for a week, which is her first time away from the kids since they were born. The husband will be handling all the chores and cooking alone. The kids are picky eaters, and the wife knows their preferences better because she's been the main cook. The husband asks her to prep meals for the week, but she gets upset, saying it's too much work and suggests making sandwiches instead. The husband feels it's reasonable since she's the one leaving, and he doesn't want the kids to have meltdowns over unfamiliar food.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about fairness, expectations, and communication. The husband is asking for help to make things manageable during her absence. The wife is taking the trip, so maybe she's expecting him to handle things without extra prep work. But he's worried about the kids' reactions. Is it unreasonable to ask her to prep meals if she's the one who normally handles cooking and knows the kids' preferences better?\n\nI think the husband's request makes sense because he's trying to prevent problems. However, the wife's reaction might be because she feels overwhelmed or doesn't see it as her responsibility. Maybe they didn't discuss it well enough beforehand. But the husband isn't asking for anything extraordinary\u2014just meal prep for a week. Since she's the one leaving, maybe it's fair to ask for that help. On the other hand, if she's already stressed about the trip, adding meal prep could be too much. But the husband is trying to avoid meltdowns, which is a valid concern.\n\nI don't think the husband is in the wrong. He's being proactive and considering the kids' needs. The wife's refusal might come from a place of stress or different priorities, but the request itself seems reasonable. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
