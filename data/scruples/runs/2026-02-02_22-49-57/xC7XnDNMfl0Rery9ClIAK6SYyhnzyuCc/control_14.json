It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nThe situation is that the husband wants his wife to meal prep before her trip so he can handle the kids and chores without the stress of cooking for picky eaters. The wife is upset because she thinks it's too much work. The husband is asking if he's wrong for asking this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband is taking on a big responsibility since the kids are used to the wife's cooking. He's worried about meltdowns if he can't replicate the meals. On the other hand, the wife is going away for the first time, and maybe she's already stressed about the trip. Meal prepping might add extra work before her trip, which could be a burden.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual support. The husband's request is reasonable because he's trying to manage the household alone. However, the wife might feel that the request is adding to her existing workload before her trip. The fact that she's upset suggests that maybe the timing or the amount of prep is an issue. The husband might not have considered how much effort it would take her, or maybe she has other things to do before her trip. \n\nIt's important to note that the husband is not asking her to do something she's not used to\u2014she already does the cooking. But now he's asking her to plan for the entire week in advance, which might be more than she's comfortable with. The wife's suggestion that he can just make sandwiches is a possible solution, but he might prefer the kids have their usual meals. \n\nIn terms of fairness, it's about balancing needs. The husband's need for a smoother week without meltdowns is valid, but the wife's need for not being overwhelmed before her trip is also valid. The question is whether the husband's request is reasonable. Since he's asking her to do something she's already responsible for, just in advance, it's a practical solution. However, the reaction of the wife indicates that maybe there's more to it\u2014perhaps the workload, stress, or other factors.\n\nBut the husband isn't wrong for wanting to prepare. He's trying to manage his responsibilities. The wife's refusal might stem from her own stress. The answer here would likely be B (the author isn't in the wrong), because his request is reasonable, and he's trying to support himself during her absence. However, communication is key. He should have discussed it more to understand her perspective. But based on the scenario given, he's not in the wrong.\n"
