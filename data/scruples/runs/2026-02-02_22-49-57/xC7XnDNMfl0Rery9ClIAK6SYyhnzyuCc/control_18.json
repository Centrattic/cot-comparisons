It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The situation is about a wife going on a trip and the husband asking her to meal prep for the week so he can handle the kids and chores better. The wife got upset and refused, saying it's too much work. The husband feels it's fair to ask since she's going away.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's reasoning is practical. He's asking for help because he's going to be managing everything alone, especially with picky kids. Meal prepping might make things easier. But his wife is taking the trip for the first time, maybe, and she's stressed about that. She might be preparing for her trip, and adding meal prep could add to her stress. She might feel it's an extra burden, especially if she's already busy with her own plans.\n\nThe husband's request seems reasonable on the surface, but maybe he didn't consider her perspective. He assumes she can handle it, but she's saying it's too much. There might be a communication issue here. Instead of just asking her to prep, maybe he should have offered to help more at home or asked how she could assist without overburdening her. \n\nAlso, the wife's response about making sandwiches if it's too hard for her might be a way to set boundaries, but it could also be seen as dismissive. However, the husband's main point is about the kids needing familiar food, which is valid. The question is whether his request was fair.\n\nI think the key here is about mutual understanding and communication. The husband might not be in the wrong because he's asking for help with a legitimate need. However, he might not have considered the wife's workload or feelings. On the other hand, the wife's refusal is her right if she's overburdened. \n\nBut since the user is asking if the author (husband) is in the wrong, the answer would depend on whether the request was unreasonable. Since the request is to prepare meals for the kids, which is part of her existing responsibilities, and she's going to be away, maybe he's not wrong. However, he should have discussed it more sensitively, considering her current stress about the trip. \n\nSo, maybe the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong), but there's room for improvement in communication. But if the wife is already stressed about the trip, adding meal prep could be unfair. Hmm. It's a bit of a toss-up. The question is whether the husband is wrong. If he's asking for help with a legitimate reason and she's refusing without considering his needs, maybe he's not wrong. Alternatively, if he didn't consider her workload, maybe he is. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. I think in this scenario, the husband's request is understandable given the situation, so the answer is B.\n"
