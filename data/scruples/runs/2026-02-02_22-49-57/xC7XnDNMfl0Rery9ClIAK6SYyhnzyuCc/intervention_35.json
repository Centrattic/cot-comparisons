It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting their wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going on a week-long trip for the first time since having kids, and the author is worried about handling the cooking and chores alone. The wife got upset when asked to prep meals, saying it's too much work, and suggested sandwiches instead.\n\nHmm. The author's reasoning is that the kids are picky, and the wife knows their preferences better because she's done most of the cooking. So the request is to ease the burden. The wife is taking a week off, so maybe the author thinks she should prepare in advance to make it manageable for him. But he's now asking if he's the a**hole for this.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author is trying to manage responsibilities during a time when the wife is away. It's reasonable to want to have some structure. But on the other hand, the wife is already going to be away and taking on work, so adding meal prep might be an extra burden she might not feel comfortable with. Maybe she's already stressed about the trip or her workload, and the author's request is adding to that. Also, the wife might feel that the author isn't confident in his own ability to handle the cooking, which could be a point of contention.\n\nThe author mentions that the wife said it's too much work and offered sandwiches as an alternative. Maybe he's trying to avoid last-minute stress, but the wife's reaction suggests that she might not see meal prepping as necessary or fair. The author might be assuming that the wife has to cover her part even when she's not around, which could be a valid point, but how it's communicated matters. If the request was made as a demand rather than a collaborative effort, that could be part of the issue. Also, the wife might have her own reasons for not wanting to prep, like not feeling like she can take on more before the trip, or maybe she's already arranged for other help.\n\nAnother angle: the author is asking the wife to do something that could make his time managing the household easier, but if the wife is already preparing for her trip, adding meal prep might be too much. The author should consider her limits and the actual effort required. Maybe there's a middle ground, like prepping a couple of days instead of the whole week, or having the kids adjust a bit. The key here is communication and mutual consideration. The wife's offer to make sandwiches could be a compromise, but the author seems resistant to that, thinking it's not sufficient. \n\nIs it unfair? Well, the wife is going away, so if she's taking on work, maybe she expects the author to take on her usual chores. However, the author is right that the wife knows the kids' preferences better, so meal prep could help. But if the wife is already stressed about the trip, asking her to do more might add to her stress. The author also needs to respect her feelings and limits. Perhaps he should have discussed it more with her, maybe offered to split the prep work or take some on himself. The wife's reaction is valid if she feels it's too much to ask her, especially during a time when she's preparing for a trip. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, he's not entirely to blame, but maybe there's a lack of understanding from his side. He might not be considering her current workload or the fact that she's already dealing with the stress of leaving. The wife might also have valid reasons for not wanting to prep, but the author's intent is to make things easier, which is reasonable. However, the way the request was made and the wife's reaction are part of the equation. Since the wife is the one who is going to be away, maybe the author should take some initiative without expecting her to do extra. But again, if the wife is okay with doing some prep, it's a good idea. The problem is the wife is upset, so the author might have overstepped by expecting her to prep for the entire week without considering her feelings or the timing. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), because the author is trying to manage his responsibilities and the request is practical. However, he could have approached it more sensitively. The wife's upset reaction might indicate that he should have considered her situation more. But the core issue is about workload distribution and mutual support. Since he's the one handling the chores, asking her to prep a week of meals could be a reasonable request, but it's possible he's taking it for granted that she can do it without considering her stress. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. There's no clear right or wrong, but the author's intention is valid. So maybe he's not in the wrong, but could have communicated better. So the answer is B.\n"
