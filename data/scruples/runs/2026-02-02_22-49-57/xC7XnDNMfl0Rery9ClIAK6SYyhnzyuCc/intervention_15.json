It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the wife is going on a week-long trip, her first since the kids were born. The husband is worried about handling the cooking and chores alone because the kids are picky and she knows their preferences better. He asked her to meal prep before the trip, but she got upset and said it's too much work, offering to make sandwiches instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's request seems reasonable. He's trying to prepare for a challenging week ahead, and since his wife is more experienced with the kids' food preferences, having her prep meals could help. The wife's reaction might be about the additional work or maybe feeling that the husband isn't doing enough himself. But is the husband in the wrong for asking?\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I should check if there's any cultural or social norms I'm missing. In some relationships, dividing responsibilities is a given, but when one partner is going to be away, it's common to adjust. The husband is acknowledging that he can handle it but is asking for help to avoid meltdowns. The wife might feel that the husband should take more initiative instead of relying on her prep. However, the husband isn't asking her to do the work while she's away; he's asking her to do it before she leaves. That seems fair. \n\nI also wonder if there's a communication issue here. Maybe the wife felt the request was last-minute or too much to handle, or perhaps she resents the implication that she's the only one who can do it. But the husband's intention is to make things easier, not to criticize her. \n\nIn terms of fairness, if the wife normally handles cooking and the husband is taking over, asking her to prepare meals before leaving could be a reasonable adjustment. The wife's alternative of sandwiches is dismissive, which might indicate she's not taking his concerns seriously. \n\nSo, I think the author is not in the wrong. He's being proactive and asking for help to manage a stressful situation. The wife's reaction is valid, but the request itself seems fair. Answer B.\n"
