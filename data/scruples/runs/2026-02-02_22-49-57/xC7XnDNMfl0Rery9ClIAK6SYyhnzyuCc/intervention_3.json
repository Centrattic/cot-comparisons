It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting their wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going on a week-long trip, which is her first time away from the kids since they were born. The husband handles chores and cooking, but the wife knows the kids' food preferences better. He asked her to prep dinners for the week, but she got upset and refused, suggesting he make sandwiches instead. The author thinks he's not in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The husband's request seems reasonable because he's taking on additional responsibilities. The wife might feel overwhelmed or think the prep is too much work. But he's asking for help to manage the kids' picky eating, which he can't handle alone. \n\nIs the request fair? Meal prepping for a week is a lot, but considering the wife is going away and the husband is handling more, maybe it's a fair ask. The wife's reaction might stem from stress about the trip or feeling overburdened. However, the husband's need for support is valid. \n\nThe key points: The wife is asking for help with something she's more capable of. The husband isn't imposing a new task but asking for assistance in an area where she's more skilled. The wife's refusal could be due to her own stress, but the request isn't unreasonable. \n\nI think the husband is in the right because he's seeking help to manage a situation he's not confident handling alone. The wife's refusal might be valid due to her own stress, but the request isn't unfair. So the answer should be B.\n"
