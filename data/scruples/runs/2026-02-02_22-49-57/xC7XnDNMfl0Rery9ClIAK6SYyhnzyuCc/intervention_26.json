It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting their wife to meal prep before her trip.\n\nThe situation is that the wife is going on a week-long trip, the first time away from the kids. The husband is worried about handling all the chores and cooking. Since the wife usually does the cooking and knows the kids' preferences better, he asked her to prep dinners for the week. She got upset, saying that's too much work and suggested he could just make sandwiches. He doesn't want the kids to have meltdowns over unfamiliar food.\n\nI need to determine if the husband is in the wrong here. The user thinks he isn't, but wants to confirm.\n\nFirst, consider the husband's perspective. He's asking for help to manage a challenging week. The wife is the primary cook, and she's aware of the kids' needs. Meal prepping could ease the load. He's not forcing her but making a request. However, she might feel overwhelmed with her own trip preparations and find the request excessive. \n\nIs it unfair to ask for help? If the wife is willing to take the trip, she might be responsible for ensuring the household runs smoothly. But if she's already stressed about her trip, asking for more might be too much. The key is whether the request is reasonable. Meal prepping requires time and effort, and if she's not up for it, maybe he should find another solution. However, he's also considering the kids' well-being and wants to avoid meltdowns. \n\nIt's a balance between sharing responsibilities and respecting each other's limits. The husband's request is practical, but the wife's refusal might stem from her own capacity. Neither is entirely wrong; they might need to compromise. But based on the information, the husband isn't in the wrong for making a reasonable request to ease his burden.\n"
