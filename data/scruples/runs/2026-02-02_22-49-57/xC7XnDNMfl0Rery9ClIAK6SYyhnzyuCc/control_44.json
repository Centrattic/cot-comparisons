      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting their wife to meal prep before her trip. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The wife is going on a week-long trip, which is the first time she's away from the kids since they were born. The husband is taking over her chores, including cooking, which he's not as comfortable with because the kids are picky and the wife knows their preferences better. He asked her to prep meals for the week to make it easier, but she got upset and said that's too much work, suggesting he make sandwiches instead. The husband feels it's not unfair to ask, given she's going away for a week.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLet me consider both sides. The husband's perspective: He's asking for meal prep to ease his workload, especially since he's less experienced in cooking for the kids. It's reasonable to want consistency and avoid meltdowns if the kids don't get their usual food. The wife is taking a trip, so maybe it's fair to ask for some prep before leaving.\n\nThe wife's reaction: She got upset, calling the request too much work. She's going away, so maybe she feels it's already a burden and doesn't want to add more. The suggestion to make sandwiches implies she thinks the request is excessive, perhaps because prepping for a whole week is time-consuming and maybe she's already planning to be busy with her trip.\n\nPossible angles to consider: Communication styles, expectations of support, work-life balance. The husband might not have considered her perspective\u2014maybe she's already stressed about the trip or doesn't see cooking as her sole responsibility anymore. Alternatively, he's trying to plan ahead to manage his responsibilities, which is reasonable.\n\nIs the request unfair? The wife is present to prep the meals before she leaves, so it's within her control. The husband is trying to set himself up for success. However, maybe the wife feels that the request is an added pressure on top of her trip preparations. There might be a lack of negotiation here\u2014perhaps the husband didn't consider alternatives that are less demanding than full prepping.\n\nBut the core issue is whether it's reasonable to ask. The wife is available to prep before leaving, so it's feasible. The husband has a valid reason (kids' preferences, his own unfamiliarity with cooking for them). However, the wife's reaction suggests that she feels it's an unreasonable request. The problem might be in the husband not considering her feelings or workload, but the request itself might not be in the wrong. He's trying to manage his responsibilities, which is a common issue in partnerships. However, expecting her to do the meal prep might be seen as shifting the responsibility instead of sharing it. Maybe a better approach would have been discussing possible compromises or splitting the cooking tasks during her trip instead of expecting her to prep everything beforehand.\n\nBut according to the scenario, the wife is going to be gone during the week, so the only time she can prep is before she leaves. The husband is asking her to do that. If the wife is able to do it, then it's a fair request. However, if she's already stressed or overburdened, maybe the husband should have found another way. But the question is about whether the husband is in the wrong, not necessarily if the wife is right to react that way. The husband's intent is to make things easier, which is understandable. The wife's refusal might be based on her own stress or other factors, but the husband isn't necessarily wrong for making the request. \n\nIn terms of fairness, since the wife is present to prep and the husband is taking on more work, it's reasonable for him to ask for some help. However, the way he made the request might have been too direct without considering her feelings. But the question is about being in the wrong, not the communication style. The author isn't wrong for wanting to plan ahead. So the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
