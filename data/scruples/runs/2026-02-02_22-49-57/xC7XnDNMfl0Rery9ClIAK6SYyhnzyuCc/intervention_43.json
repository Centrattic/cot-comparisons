It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting their wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going away for a week, the first time since the kids were born. The author usually shares chores with the wife, but cooking is her main responsibility. He can cook, but the kids are picky and the wife knows their preferences better. So he asked her to prep the dinners for the week to make it easier on him. She got upset, saying that's too much work and offered to make sandwiches instead. The author feels it's not unfair because she's the one leaving and he's taking over her chores.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about fairness and expectations in a partnership. The author is trying to prepare for the week the wife is away, which is a big deal since the kids are picky. He's balancing work and childcare alone. Meal prepping would help reduce his stress. But the wife sees it as too much work. \n\nI need to consider if it's reasonable to ask her to prep meals before her trip. On one hand, he's asking her to do extra work before she leaves. But since cooking is her normal responsibility, maybe it's a way to maintain consistency for the kids. Also, she's leaving, so perhaps the author is setting up the house to handle her absence. \n\nBut on the other hand, if the trip is for a vacation or a necessary event, it's possible the wife might feel that the author isn't sharing the load fairly. Maybe he's expecting her to do more work just because she's the primary cook. However, the author is the one who is left to manage everything, so he might be trying to avoid a crisis by getting the meals ready. \n\nThe wife's reaction seems harsh. She might be feeling overwhelmed, but her response was to say it's too much work and offer a less ideal solution. The author might feel it's a reasonable request to ensure the kids eat well and to ease his burden. \n\nIt's important to note that in a relationship, partners should communicate and support each other. The author is planning ahead and trying to manage the situation. The wife's refusal could indicate that she's not considering the author's need for support. \n\nSo, I think the author isn't in the wrong. He's making a practical request based on his past experience and current situation. The wife's reaction is the problem here. The answer should be B.\n"
