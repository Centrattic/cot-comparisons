It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband wants his wife to meal prep before her trip so he can handle cooking for the kids by himself. The wife refused, saying it's too much work, and suggests he make sandwiches instead. The husband is worried about the kids' reactions if the meals aren't as they're used to.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both sides. The husband is taking on a big responsibility with the kids for the first time. Cooking is the wife's usual task, and she knows the kids' preferences better. He's asking her to prep meals as a way to make it easier. On the other hand, the wife is going on a trip, which is her first time away, and she feels it's too much to ask her to prep meals while she's packing for the trip. She's probably already stressed about the trip and her own responsibilities.\n\nSo, is the husband wrong? Well, his request is reasonable in that he's trying to prepare for a challenging week. However, he's making an ask of his wife during her time of preparing for a trip. If she's already busy, adding meal prep might be overwhelming. The key here is communication and compromise. The husband should have discussed this with her in advance, maybe considering her workload for the trip. The wife's response that he can make sandwiches suggests she's not in a position to help, perhaps due to her own stress or time constraints.\n\nThe husband's intention is to avoid meltdowns with the kids, which is valid. But he might not have considered that the wife might be stretched thin with her own preparations. It's possible he didn't check in with her about how much she can realistically handle. The wife's refusal could stem from feeling overburdened, not from being inconsiderate.\n\nIn terms of fairness, it's a shared responsibility. The husband is taking over chores, but he's not used to cooking, so his request is practical. However, expecting her to prep meals might not be the best approach if it's causing her stress. The answer might depend on whether the request was made in a considerate way, taking into account her situation.\n\nSo, the husband isn't entirely in the wrong, but he could have been more understanding of her workload. The wife's response, while dismissive, might be due to her own stress. The key is that both parties need to communicate better. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer would be that he's not in the wrong (B), but there's room for both to adjust their approach. However, the wife's reaction is valid too, so maybe the husband isn't at fault, but the situation requires more empathy from both sides.\n"
