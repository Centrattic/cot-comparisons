It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting his wife to meal prep before her trip. The author's wife is going away for a week, and he's worried about handling the kids and chores alone. Since cooking is her responsibility and the kids are picky, he asked her to prep meals. She got upset and said it's too much, suggesting sandwiches instead.\n\nHmm, I need to analyze both sides. The author's reasoning is practical: he's preparing for a challenging week, and meal prep would help. He's not asking for the whole week's meals, just dinners for the days she's away. He's also considering the kids' preferences, which he can't match as well. On the other hand, the wife might feel overwhelmed. Prepping meals could take time she's not willing to give, especially if she's already planning to be away and possibly busy with travel prep. Maybe she feels it's an extra burden or that he's not respecting her autonomy by assuming she has to do it. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, he's trying to set himself up for success during her absence. It's reasonable to ask for help in a division of labor that's already established. However, the wife's reaction might indicate that she's overburdened. Maybe the request was too last-minute or she's stressed about the trip itself. The key is whether the request is fair. Since cooking is her role and the kids are picky, it's not unreasonable. But perhaps the author didn't consider her workload before the trip. Maybe he should have discussed it earlier or offered to help with the prep instead of leaving it all to her. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong. \n\nIn my view, the author's intention is to make things easier, which is valid. The wife's refusal could be based on her own stress. The author isn't in the wrong for making a reasonable request. So the answer is B.\n"
