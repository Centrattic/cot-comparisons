It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going on a week-long trip, her first since the kids were born. The husband is worried about handling the chores and cooking, especially since the kids are picky and the wife knows their preferences better. He asked her to prep meals, but she got upset and said it's too much work, suggesting he can make sandwiches if it's hard.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The husband's reasoning is that he's taking over a lot of responsibilities, and since he's not as experienced in cooking for the kids, meal prepping would help avoid meltdowns. The wife, on the other hand, feels it's too much to ask, maybe because she's already preparing for her trip, or perhaps she's stressed about the trip itself. \n\nIs it reasonable to ask her to meal prep? Well, she's going away, so maybe she does have the time before leaving to do this. Also, the husband is asking for her help to manage a situation he's unprepared for. But maybe she's already planning to do a lot of prep for her trip, like packing, arrangements for the kids, etc., and this is just one more thing added. \n\nThe key points here are about fairness and mutual support. The husband is trying to make things easier for himself during a challenging week, which is understandable. However, the wife might feel that the request is adding extra work to her trip prep. But isn't part of being a team supporting each other in times of need? If she's leaving for a week, maybe she can handle the meal prep before leaving. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the husband should have offered to cover some of her other responsibilities in exchange, or at least acknowledged her effort. But the question is whether he's in the wrong just for making the request. \n\nI think the husband's intention is valid\u2014he wants to ensure the kids are fed properly and avoid stress. The wife's reaction might stem from feeling overwhelmed. But the request itself isn't unreasonable. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
