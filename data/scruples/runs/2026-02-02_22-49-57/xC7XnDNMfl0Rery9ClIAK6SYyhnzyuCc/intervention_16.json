      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author's wife is going on a week-long trip for the first time since the kids were born. The author is taking over her chores, including cooking, which is usually her responsibility. The kids are picky eaters, and the author feels less confident about cooking for them compared to the wife. So he asked her to meal prep for the week to make things easier. The wife got upset and said that's too much work, suggesting he just make sandwiches if things get hard. The author is asking if he's in the wrong (AITA) for making this request.\n\nFirst, let me consider the key points. The wife is going away, so she's not there to help during the trip. The author is taking on extra responsibilities (both work and chores). He's asking her to prep meals beforehand because he's not as skilled in cooking for picky kids. The wife is upset, thinking it's too much work.\n\nIs it reasonable to ask the wife to meal prep before her trip? Well, if the wife is the primary cook and knows the kids' preferences better, maybe it's logical to ask her to handle that part before she leaves. The author is trying to avoid meltdowns from the kids if the food isn't right. The wife is taking a week off, so she's choosing to go on this trip. If she's the one who's going away, it's fair that she can prepare some meals in advance, especially if it's a one-time thing. \n\nBut wait, the wife might feel that preparing a week's worth of meals is an extra burden. Maybe she's already stressed about the trip, or she doesn't think she has the time or energy to do that. The author's request might be seen as adding to her workload before the trip. However, the alternative is the author having to manage cooking for a week with picky kids, which could be more stressful and time-consuming. \n\nIs the author's request unreasonable? If the wife is the primary cook, then having her prepare meals in advance makes sense. But if the wife is already overwhelmed, maybe the author should have considered other solutions, like asking her to prep just a few meals or using frozen options. However, the author's reasoning is that his wife's knowledge of the kids' preferences is crucial, so meal prepping would prevent issues. \n\nAnother angle: the wife might feel that since she's going away, she shouldn't have to do work for the household during her absence. The author could be assuming that she's available to prep before the trip, which she might be. But if the timing is tight or she's already busy, it could be a problem. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the author is trying to balance his workload. He's not asking her to do anything during her trip, just before she leaves. Since the trip is her choice, maybe it's reasonable to ask for some preparation. However, if the wife feels it's too much, the author could have found another way, but the request itself isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's request seems reasonable. He's trying to manage his responsibilities during the week the wife is away, and the wife's knowledge is key. The wife's reaction might stem from feeling overburdened, but the author isn't in the wrong for asking. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
