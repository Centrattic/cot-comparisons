It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going on a week-long trip, her first since having kids, and the husband is taking over her chores. Cooking isn't his strong suit, and the kids are picky, so he wants her to prep meals. She got upset, thinking it's too much work, and suggests he just make sandwiches if it's hard.\n\nFirst, the husband's reasoning: he's managing work and chores alone, wants to avoid kid meltdowns from unfamiliar food, and the wife knows their kids' preferences better. He's asking her to prep meals as a way to support his situation during her absence. \n\nThe wife's response is that it's too much work. Maybe she's stressed about her trip or feels overburdened. But the husband isn't forcing her; he's making a request. He's considering the kids' needs and his own capacity. Since she's the one going on the trip, it might be reasonable to ask for some preparation. However, if she's already stressed or the prep would genuinely be too much for her, maybe the request is a bit unreasonable. But the husband's intent seems practical and to prevent problems. \n\nI think the key points are mutual understanding and compromise. The husband is trying to plan ahead to avoid stress, which is reasonable. The wife's refusal might stem from her own stress or workload. But the question is whether the husband is in the wrong. Since he's not forcing her and is articulating his needs, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, if the request is unreasonably burdensome, it could be his fault. But given the context, he's just asking her to do something that would help him, and it's her choice whether to do it. So the answer leans B.\n"
