It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip.\n\nFirst, the situation: The wife is going on a week-long trip, her first time away from the kids since they were born. The husband will be handling all the chores and cooking alone. Normally, the wife does the cooking, and she knows the kids' food preferences better. The husband wants her to prep meals for the week so he doesn't have to deal with picky eaters alone. The wife gets upset, saying it's too much work, and suggests he just make sandwiches if it's too hard.\n\nSo, the key points are: the husband is overwhelmed with the impending responsibility, he's asking for help that's reasonable given his situation, but the wife is resistant. \n\nNow, is the husband in the wrong? Well, he's asking for something that makes sense for the situation. He's not trying to burden her, but to make his week manageable. The wife's response seems dismissive and possibly underestimates his need. The husband's request is practical, considering he's not used to handling cooking alone and the kids are picky. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the wife is stressed about her trip and the request is an added stressor. But the husband's request is reasonable, especially since it's her trip and she's the one who usually handles the cooking. It's fair to ask for a favor that makes his temporary situation easier. \n\nThe husband isn't being unreasonable. He's asking for help that's within her capability, and the wife's reaction might be more about her own stress than the request itself. So, the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
