It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband wants his wife to meal prep before her trip, but she refused and got upset. He's defending his request by saying he's not used to cooking for the kids, they're picky, and he's already taking over her chores and work. She offered sandwiches instead.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the reasonableness of the request. Meal prepping isn't unreasonable, especially if it's to make things easier for someone handling the kids alone. The husband is asking for help because he's overwhelmed. However, the wife is going on a trip, and maybe she's already stressed about it. Maybe she doesn't feel like the extra work is fair, especially if they don't usually do it. \n\nThe husband's side is that he's trying to avoid meltdowns from the kids if he messes up the food. That's a valid concern. He's not asking her to do something unreasonable; it's just planning ahead. The wife's reaction might be because she feels it's too much, but is that valid? Maybe she's overburdened, but she's the one going away, so maybe she's in a better position to prepare. \n\nAlso, the husband is taking over her responsibilities, so he's already adjusting. The wife's alternative of sandwiches seems like a cop-out. The husband might feel that's not what the kids are used to, leading to stress. \n\nI think the key points are: Is the husband's request fair? The wife is going away, so meal prepping is a temporary measure. The husband is asking for help that's within the wife's capability. The wife's refusal might stem from her own stress about the trip. \n\nBut maybe the husband didn't consider her feelings. He could have been more understanding if she's already preparing for the trip and doesn't want the extra work. However, the husband's reasoning is practical. It's a balance between mutual support and respecting each other's limits. \n\nIn AITA situations, it's often about communication and perspective. If the husband explained his concerns more clearly, maybe the wife would have been more willing. Alternatively, the wife could have offered a middle ground, like prepping a few meals instead of the whole week. \n\nOverall, the husband's request isn't unreasonable. The wife's reaction might be a bit over the top, but it's also possible she has valid reasons. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer likely leans towards B (No), because his request is reasonable given the circumstances.\n"
