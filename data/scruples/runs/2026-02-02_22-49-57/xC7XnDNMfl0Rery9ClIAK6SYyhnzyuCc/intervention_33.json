It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their wife to meal prep before a trip. The situation involves the wife going away for a week, leaving the husband to handle the kids and chores. The husband cooks, but the kids are picky, and he's not as familiar with their preferences. He asks her to prep meals, but she's upset, saying it's too much work and offers sandwiches instead.\n\nFirst, the husband's request seems reasonable. He's taking over her usual responsibilities, so asking for help to make the transition smoother makes sense. Meal prepping could save time and reduce stress. The wife's reaction is a bit confusing. She's going on the trip, so she's the one who's absent. If she's not willing to help, why is she upset? Maybe she feels it's too much for her to handle while packing, or perhaps she's resentful about the increased workload on the husband. But the husband's main concern is the kids' eating habits and avoiding meltdowns. \n\nIs it unfair to ask her to prep before leaving? Since she's going away, maybe it's a fair request. She's not there to do the cooking during the trip, so prepping before makes sense. The alternative is the husband struggling with picky eaters, which could be more stressful. The wife's offer of sandwiches seems dismissive and doesn't address the underlying issue. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the husband didn't consider her workload. If she's preparing for the trip, maybe meal prepping adds to that. But the husband's reasoning is valid: he needs the support because he's less experienced. It's a balance between supporting each other. The key is whether the request is reasonable given the circumstances. \n\nThe husband isn't asking her to do something during the trip; he's asking her to prepare in advance. That's a responsible way to handle things. The wife's refusal might stem from stress or feeling overwhelmed, but the husband's request is about ensuring the kids are fed properly. \n\nSo, the husband isn't in the wrong. He's asking for practical help to manage a challenging week. The wife's reaction is the issue here, not the husband's request.\n"
