She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip.\n\nFirst, the situation: the wife is going on a week-long trip, first time away from the kids. The husband will be handling all the chores and cooking. Cooking is usually the wife's job, and the kids are picky. The husband asks her to prep meals for the week to make it easier. She gets upset, says it's too much work, and offers an alternative of making sandwiches. The husband thinks it's unfair not to ask her since she's the one going away.\n\nHmm. So the husband's reasoning is that since she's the primary cook, and she knows the kids' preferences better, asking her to prep meals before she leaves is reasonable. He doesn't want the kids to have meltdowns over unfamiliar food. The wife is upset about the extra work.\n\nI need to figure out if the husband is in the wrong. Let's break it down. Is asking someone to do a task before they leave for a trip, especially a task that benefits the person staying behind, unreasonable? Well, the wife is taking time off, so maybe the husband expects some preparation to make his week easier. But is it fair to expect her to do prep work as part of her departure?\n\nOn one hand, the husband is trying to manage the household without her, which is a valid concern. On the other hand, the wife is already leaving for a week; adding meal prep could be seen as an extra burden. However, the husband is not asking her to do the cooking during her trip, just to prepare in advance. Since she's the one who usually cooks and knows the kids' preferences, it makes sense she would be the one to prep the meals. But maybe the wife feels that since she's leaving, he should handle it himself now that he's in charge. \n\nAnother angle: is the husband overstepping by not considering her workload? Maybe she has her own preparations for the trip and doesn't want to add meal prepping. But the husband's request is to make the week easier for him, which is a practical concern. \n\nI think the key here is mutual understanding. The husband is trying to set himself up for success, and the wife might feel it's unfair to ask her to do work when she's about to be away. However, since she's the primary cook, her input is valuable. Maybe the issue is communication\u2014she felt the request was too much, while he sees it as reasonable. \n\nIn terms of fairness, if the husband is handling all the chores and taking over cooking, but he's not as experienced, it makes sense he'd want some help. The wife is in a position to help by prepping meals, which would make his task easier. So maybe the husband isn't in the wrong. But is there an assumption here that she should do it just because she's the primary cook? Or is it about splitting responsibilities fairly? \n\nIf the wife is already doing a lot of the cooking regularly, then asking her to prep before leaving might be reasonable. However, she might feel that once she's gone, it's his responsibility to handle it. The conflict could stem from differing expectations about what's fair when one is away. \n\nI think the husband's request is logical given the circumstances. He's setting himself up for success, and the wife's refusal might be based on her own stress or workload. But since she's the one who knows the kids' preferences, her prepping would help avoid issues. So maybe the husband isn't in the wrong. He's making a practical request to ease his burden during a challenging week. The answer would likely be B (not in the wrong).\n"
