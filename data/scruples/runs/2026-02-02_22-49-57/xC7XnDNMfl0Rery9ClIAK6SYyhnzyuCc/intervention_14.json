It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author asked his wife to meal prep for the week she's away on a trip. The wife got upset, thinking it's too much work, and suggested making sandwiches instead. The author feels it's reasonable because he's not as familiar with the kids' preferences and wants to avoid meltdowns.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife is going on a trip for the first time since the kids were born, so the husband is taking over all her duties. Cooking is her responsibility, and the author is asking her to prep meals before leaving. The wife is upset, feeling it's too much work. The author's reasoning is that he's not as adept at cooking for picky kids and wants to prevent issues.\n\nIs it fair to ask her to meal prep? Well, she's going on a trip, so she's not there to do the cooking during that week. If she's prepping before she leaves, it's to help him. But maybe she's already stressed about the trip or feels overburdened. The author is trying to anticipate his own needs and make sure the kids are fed properly. He's not asking her to do the cooking while she's away, just to prepare in advance.\n\nBut then, why is she upset? Maybe she feels it's an additional task she didn't anticipate when planning the trip. Or maybe she's already stressed about being away and doesn't want the extra work. The author's request might be reasonable, but communication might be the issue. Did he talk to her about his concerns? Did she understand the reasoning?\n\nThe author might not be in the wrong because he's trying to be proactive. However, it's important to consider her perspective. If she's already preparing for the trip, maybe meal prepping adds too much. The key is whether the request is unreasonable. Since the author is taking over her responsibilities, maybe he should also take on the cooking during her absence. But he's asking her to prepare in advance because he's less experienced, which is a valid point. \n\nAnother angle: is meal prepping for a week a lot of work? Maybe it's time-consuming, and she didn't realize the extent. The author might not have considered that. Alternatively, he could have offered to help with the prep, but she might not want him involved. \n\nIn terms of fairness, if the wife agreed to the trip, she might be expected to help with the transition. But she's also on a trip, so maybe the request is a bit much. The author is in a tough spot, trying to manage everything alone. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the request is reasonable. Since the author is covering her usual duties, asking her to prep once before leaving might be a fair ask. However, if she's already busy with her trip preparations, maybe it's too much. The author's intention is good, but maybe he should have found a middle ground, like prepping a few meals instead of all. But based on the information, the author's request seems reasonable given the kids' needs. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
