It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting his wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going away for the first time since the kids were born, and the husband is worried about handling the chores and cooking. The wife is upset because he asked her to prep meals for the week, saying that's too much work, and suggests he can make sandwiches instead.\n\nHmm. So the husband's reasoning is that cooking is her responsibility, and since the kids are picky, he's not confident in his ability to cook the same meals. He wants her to prepped meals to avoid meltdowns. The wife feels it's too much to ask, especially since she's going on a trip. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. It's their household responsibilities. The wife is the primary cook, and the husband is taking over during her absence. The husband is asking her to prepare in advance to make his week easier. But she's not willing to do it, finding it an excessive request. \n\nIs the husband in the wrong? Well, he's asking for help to manage the situation. Since she's leaving, maybe she's already busy packing and preparing for her trip. If she's saying that meal prepping is too much, then maybe he's not considering her workload. But on the other hand, he has a valid reason\u2014kids are picky, and he's worried about handling the cooking alone. \n\nBut maybe there's a middle ground. Instead of full meal prep, maybe she could do a few meals or freeze some. However, she's drawn a line and said no. The husband's request is reasonable from his perspective, but it's possible that he's not respecting her limits here. If she's already stressed about the trip, adding meal prep might be unreasonable. \n\nAlso, the wife's response suggests she's upset. Maybe the husband's approach was a bit demanding. He could have asked more collaboratively, maybe offering to help with some prep instead of expecting her to do it all. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. He's trying to prepare, but maybe he's not considering her capacity. If she's refusing, and he's pushing back, perhaps that's where the issue lies. But the core issue is about shared responsibilities and communication. \n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong, but the answer could go either way. I need to decide between A and B. Considering that he's asking for help in a way that the wife finds burdensome, maybe the husband's request is reasonable but his approach isn't. However, since the wife is the primary cook and he's asking her to do what she's already doing, maybe it's not his fault. \n\nAlternatively, it's possible that the husband is not wrong because he's trying to manage the household and his stress. The wife's refusal is her own choice, so he's not in the wrong for making the request. But maybe he should have been more understanding of her workload. \n\nI'm leaning towards B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong. He's trying to prepare and manage the situation, and his request is about ensuring the kids' meals, which is reasonable. The wife's refusal is her choice, but the husband's intention is valid. However, maybe there's room for better communication, but that doesn't make him wrong. So final answer B.\n"
