It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the wife is going on a week-long trip, her first time away from the kids since they were born. The husband has to take over her chores, including cooking. Since the kids are picky and the wife knows their preferences better, he asked her to prep meals for the week. She got upset, saying it's too much work and suggested he just make sandwiches if it's hard. The husband feels it's not unfair to ask since she's the one leaving.\n\nSo, the key points here are the husband's request and the wife's reaction. The husband is trying to manage the situation by asking for help, which seems reasonable. He's not asking her to stay, but to do some prep work to make his week easier. The wife's response is that it's too much work, which might indicate she feels the request is unfair or not considering her own workload.\n\nNow, considering fairness. The husband is taking on a bigger responsibility during her absence. It's logical that he would want to minimize stress by having meals prepared. Meal prepping is common in many households when someone is stepping in to handle tasks they're less familiar with. The wife might be feeling overwhelmed, but her response seems dismissive, suggesting he just make sandwiches, which might not be ideal given the kids' picky eating.\n\nIs the husband in the wrong? It depends on the context. If the wife is already stressed about her trip or has other commitments, asking her to prep could be adding to her burden. But if the husband is genuinely trying to prepare and the wife is being dismissive, then maybe he's not wrong. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for making the request.\n\nAnother angle: communication. The husband's approach might have been too direct or not considering her current workload. Maybe he should have discussed it earlier or found a compromise. But the wife's reaction seems a bit harsh. The husband's intention is to manage the household, which is a valid concern.\n\nI think the husband isn't in the wrong here. He's asking for practical help to manage a challenging week. The wife's refusal and dismissive comment might be the issue, not the request itself. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
