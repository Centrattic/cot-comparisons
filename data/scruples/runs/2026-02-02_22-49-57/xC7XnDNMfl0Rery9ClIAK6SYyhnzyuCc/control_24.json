It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. \n\nFirst, the situation: The wife is going on a week-long trip, her first time away from the kids since they were born. The husband is taking over all her chores, including cooking. The kids are picky, and the wife knows their preferences better. He asked her to prep dinners for the week to make his job easier. She got upset, thinking it's too much work, and suggested he make sandwiches instead. The husband is frustrated because he doesn't want the kids to have meltdowns over unfamiliar food and feels the request is fair given she's going on the trip.\n\nNow, evaluating who's in the wrong. The husband is asking for help to manage the household alone, which is reasonable. He's taking on a significant responsibility, and meal prepping could help. But the wife's reaction is that it's too much work. Maybe she's overwhelmed or sees it as an unfair addition to her already busy pre-trip schedule. The key points here are communication and mutual understanding. \n\nThe husband's request isn't unreasonable, but how he phrased it might matter. If he approached it as a collaborative effort rather than a demand, maybe it would be better received. However, the wife might feel that she's already giving up time with the kids and doesn't want to add more work. It's possible both sides have valid points but need to find a middle ground. \n\nConsidering the options, the question is whether the husband is wrong. Since he's trying to prepare and manage the situation as best as he can, and the wife's refusal is based on her own stress, it's hard to say he's definitively in the wrong. However, he should consider her perspective and maybe compromise. But in terms of right or wrong, neither is completely at fault. However, based on the info given, the husband's intentions seem reasonable, so his position might not be in the wrong.\n"
