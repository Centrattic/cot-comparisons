It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author asked their wife to meal prep for the week she's away, and she got upset. The main points are that the author is handling all the chores and kids solo for the first time, and cooking is usually the wife's responsibility. The kids are picky, and the author wants to avoid meltdowns.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. The author's reasoning is that since the wife is better at cooking and knows the kids' preferences, meal prepping would make things easier. The wife, however, finds it too much work and offers an alternative (sandwiches). The author feels they're not asking for much since the wife is going away anyway.\n\nIs there a wrong here? Well, the author's request seems reasonable. They're trying to prepare for a challenging week. But maybe the wife feels it's unfair because she's already leaving and now has to prep too. Maybe she's stressed about the trip or the prep work. The author might not have considered that the prep could be seen as an extra burden when she's already going away. Also, the author assumes the wife can handle the prep, but maybe she's not in the best position to do so before her trip. \n\nOn the other hand, the author's intent is to make things manageable. Since they don't have experience with the kids' meal preferences, relying on the wife's prepped meals makes sense. The wife's response of making sandwiches is a cop-out, perhaps not addressing the author's need for consistency for the kids. \n\nBut maybe the author should have offered to help with the prep or found a middle ground. However, the wife didn't ask for help, but she's now refusing. The author's request seems practical. The key is whether the request is unfair. Since the wife is the one leaving, the author argues that it's fair to ask her to prep before she goes. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because the request is reasonable and based on practical needs. The wife's reaction might be due to stress or different priorities. So the answer is B.\n"
