It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going away for a week, and the husband needs help with cooking since the kids are picky and he's not as familiar with their preferences. He asked her to prep dinners for the week, but she got upset and said it's too much work. He's wondering if he's being unreasonable.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's perspective is that he's worried about handling the kids and chores alone for the first time. He's concerned about their mealtime meltdowns if he can't cook what they usually have. From his point of view, asking her to prep meals is a reasonable way to ease the transition for both him and the kids. He's not asking for something impossible; he wants her to do what she normally does but in advance. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife's reaction suggests that she finds the request burdensome. Maybe she's already stressed about the trip, or perhaps she has other responsibilities. It's possible that meal prepping for a week is a lot of work, and she feels it's unfair because she's already taking a break from her usual duties. She mentioned that if it's too hard, he can just do sandwiches, which might indicate she's trying to be helpful by offering an alternative, but the husband isn't satisfied with that.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and common practices. Meal prepping is a common way to manage cooking for a family, especially when someone is unavailable. If the wife typically handles most of the cooking, asking her to prep in advance for a week seems practical. However, it's also important to recognize that she might have valid reasons for not wanting to do it. For example, maybe she's already doing a lot and the prep would interfere with her trip preparations or her rest before the trip. \n\nAnother angle is communication. The husband's request might have been presented in a way that didn't consider her workload or feelings. If he came across as demanding instead of collaborative, that could explain her upset reaction. Maybe he could have discussed it earlier or found a middle ground, like prepping just a few meals instead of all. But from the text, he seems to genuinely want to make things easier, not to impose an unfair burden. \n\nAlso, the fact that the kids are picky adds weight to the husband's concern. If the kids are used to a certain routine, changing it might cause stress. The husband is trying to maintain some stability, which is reasonable. The wife's alternative of sandwiches might not be feasible if the kids are very picky about their meals, not just the type of food but also the presentation. \n\nIn terms of fairness, since the wife is the one going away, it's logical that she would assist in ensuring things run smoothly. If the husband were going away, she would likely do the same. However, it's possible that the wife is feeling overwhelmed by the request, especially if it's a significant time commitment. The key here is whether the request is within reason. Meal prepping for a week can be time-consuming, so if the wife is already busy with packing or work-related tasks, it could be a valid concern. \n\nThe husband's argument is that it's her responsibility because she does the cooking. But if she's the primary cook, it's reasonable to ask her to handle the meal prep in advance. However, if the wife feels that this request is adding to her stress or that she's already overburdened, then the husband might need to adjust his expectations. \n\nIn conclusion, the answer hinges on whether the request is reasonable given the circumstances. The husband's concern is valid, and meal prepping is a common solution. However, the wife's reaction suggests that the request might be excessive or poorly communicated. The husband might not be in the wrong, but perhaps there's a need for better communication and compromise. Since the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, the answer would depend on balancing both perspectives. The husband isn't necessarily wrong for wanting to prepare, but he might need to consider his wife's workload and find a solution that works for both.\n"
