It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the man who posted this is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. His wife is going away for a week, and he's concerned about handling the kids' meals. The wife got upset and said it's too much work, suggesting sandwiches instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's position is that he's asking for prepped meals to manage the kids' picky eating, which he's not as familiar with. He's taking on a lot of extra responsibilities with the kids and chores while she's away. His request seems reasonable for reducing stress. On the other hand, the wife might feel that the request is adding too much to her already busy schedule before her trip. She's also taking time off, so maybe she's overwhelmed with packing and other preparations. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual understanding. The husband's intention is to make the week manageable, but the wife's reaction suggests she might be under stress. The question is whether the request is unfair. The husband isn't asking for something unreasonable\u2014he's leveraging her existing role in meal planning to ease his burden. However, the wife's refusal might stem from her own stress or overcommitment. \n\nI need to assess if there's a lack of communication. The husband could have discussed his concerns earlier, maybe considering her workload. But the wife's response seems dismissive, suggesting she didn't consider his valid concerns. The husband's request is practical, so he's not in the wrong. The issue might be more about how the request was made or her current stress levels. However, the core of the problem is the wife's refusal without addressing his valid needs. So, the answer is B\u2014he's not in the wrong.\n"
