It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. The key points here are that the wife is going on her first extended trip since the kids were born, and the husband will be handling all the chores and cooking alone. Cooking is the wife's responsibility, and the kids are picky, so the husband wants her to prep meals to make his week easier.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The wife is going away, and the husband is taking over her responsibilities. It's logical to think that she might be willing to help by prepping meals, especially since she knows the kids' preferences better. The husband isn't asking for something unreasonable, like doing all the cooking during her trip, but rather a pre-trip preparation to make things smoother. \n\nHowever, the wife got upset, thinking it's too much work. Maybe she feels it's unfair because she's already preparing for her trip, or perhaps she's stressed about the trip itself. But the husband's request is practical. He's not asking her to do the cooking during her trip; it's just prepping a week's worth of meals before she leaves. \n\nIs there a cultural or societal expectation here? In many relationships, partners share responsibilities, and asking for help when one is taking over a role can be seen as reasonable. The husband's concern about the kids' meltdowns shows he's trying to maintain consistency, which is in the kids' best interest. \n\nBut maybe the issue is communication. The wife's response about sandwiches seems dismissive. If she's not willing to prep meals, maybe they need to find a compromise, like prepping a few meals instead of all. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for making the request, not about the wife's response. \n\nSince the husband's request is practical and aims to manage the workload, especially given the kids' picky eating, it's not unreasonable. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
