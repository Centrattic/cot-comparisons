It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (the husband) is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going on a week-long trip, her first since the kids were born. The husband is worried about handling all the chores and cooking, especially since the kids are picky and the wife knows their preferences better.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband is taking on a big responsibility here\u2014managing alone with the kids for a week. Cooking is normally the wife's job, and he's not as experienced with the kids' preferences. He's asking her to prep meals to make it easier. The wife got upset, thinking it's too much work, and suggested sandwiches instead.\n\nSo, is the husband in the wrong? Well, he's asking for help in a reasonable way. Since he's not as familiar with the kids' food likes, meal prepping would help prevent issues. The wife is going to be away, so it's logical she would do the prep before leaving. The fact that she's upset might be more about stress from the trip or feeling overwhelmed, but the husband's request seems fair. He's not asking her to do extra work beyond what's necessary for the situation. The key points here are mutual responsibility and communication. The wife might have felt the request was too much, but expecting her to help in a way that makes his situation manageable isn't unreasonable. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
