She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going away for a week, and the author wants her to prepare meals to ease his transition taking over her chores and cooking. The wife got upset and said it's too much work, suggesting he can just make sandwiches instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is asking for help from his wife to make his week manageable. Cooking isn't his usual responsibility, and the kids are picky. The wife is the one who's more familiar with their preferences. The author's request is reasonable because he's trying to set himself up for success during a potentially stressful time. But the wife is feeling overwhelmed by the request. \n\nNow, the key points to evaluate: Is the request unreasonable? Meal prepping for a week is a significant task, but it's a one-time effort. The wife is going to be away, so it's logical to ask her to prepare in advance. However, maybe the wife feels she's already dealing with her own travel preparations and this adds stress. It's important to consider her perspective.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he's not asking for much, given the wife is taking a week off. But the wife's response was emotional, indicating that the request is burdensome. Maybe the author didn't consider how much work prepping would be for her. Alternatively, the author is trying to be proactive and realistic about his limitations in cooking for picky kids.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author's intention is to avoid meltdowns at home, which is understandable. However, if the wife feels it's too much, the author might need to find a middle ground. But is he in the wrong? The question is whether the request is unfair. Since he's asking for something practical and temporary, it seems fair. The wife's refusal is her choice, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for making the request. He's trying to manage his responsibilities, not being selfish. So, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
