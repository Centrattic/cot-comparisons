It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away.

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for asking their wife to meal prep before her trip. The situation is that the wife is going away for a week, and the husband is worried about handling the kids and chores, especially cooking. Since cooking is her responsibility and she knows the kids' food preferences better, he asked her to prep meals for the week. She got upset, saying it's too much work, and suggested sandwiches instead.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's perspective is that he's taking on a lot more responsibility without her, and meal prepping would make things easier. He's not asking her to do something unreasonable, just to prepare meals to avoid stress later. He also points out that she's the one going away, so it's fair to ask her to take this step before leaving.\n\nOn the other hand, the wife might feel that the request is adding extra work right before her trip. Maybe she's already stressed about being away, or she might not see why she has to do the prepping when she's not the one staying. She might also think that the husband should handle it since he's staying with the kids. There's a possibility of communication issues here. The husband didn't explain his reasoning well, or maybe the wife felt it was a last-minute request, leading to her frustration.\n\nNow, considering fairness. The husband is asking for help with a task that's usually her responsibility. If she's going to be away, it's logical to take care of that before she leaves. The key here is whether the request is reasonable. Meal prepping isn't unreasonable, especially if it's for the kids' well-being. However, the wife's response suggests she might feel overwhelmed or not in the position to do it. Maybe there's a lack of understanding from both sides. The husband might not realize how much work it is, and she might not see his perspective about needing the meals.\n\nAlso, the husband mentions that he can do it, but it's just easier with her help. So, he's not forcing her but asking for assistance. The wife's alternative suggestion of sandwiches shows she's trying to help, but maybe not in the way he wanted. The conflict might be more about the approach rather than the request itself. If he had discussed it earlier or offered to help with prepping, maybe it would have been better received.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the husband isn't in the wrong for asking. He's trying to manage responsibilities while his wife is away. The wife's reaction might stem from feeling it's an added burden, but that doesn't make the husband's request unfair. The answer here is likely B, he's not in the wrong. The main issue is communication and mutual understanding rather than the request itself being unreasonable.\n"
