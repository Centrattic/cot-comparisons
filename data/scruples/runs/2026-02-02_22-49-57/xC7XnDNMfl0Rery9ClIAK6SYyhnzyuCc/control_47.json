It will be her first time away from the kids since they were born, and thus my first time operating by myself with the kids for a full week. On top of working, I will have to take over her half of the chores and keep the house together for the week.\n\nCooking is normally my wife's responsibility. I can do it, but my kids are picky and my wife knows their preferences better than I do because she's cooked more. Thus, I asked her to prep dinners for the week that she will be gone to make it easier on me. She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to. I don't think it's unfair to ask her to do this since she's going to be taking a full week away. AITA?\n\ntl;dr My wife is leaving for a week and refuses to food prep\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the husband asking his wife to meal prep before her trip. They have kids, and the wife usually handles cooking. The husband is worried about managing alone, especially with picky eaters, so he asked her to prep meals. She got upset and said it's too much work, suggesting he can just make sandwiches if needed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The husband's request seems reasonable. He's taking on her chores while she's away, and meal prepping could ease his burden. The kids are picky, so consistency in meals might prevent meltdowns. The wife is going away, so she has the time before the trip to prepare. However, she might be overwhelmed with her own pre-trip tasks and feel that prepping meals adds too much stress. Maybe she didn't anticipate the request or feels it's an extra responsibility.\n\nThe key points are: the husband's need for help, the wife's usual role, and her reaction. The husband isn't asking her to do something she doesn't normally do; he's asking her to do what she already does but in advance. It's about delegation to manage responsibilities during her absence. The wife might feel it's too much on top of her existing tasks, but the husband is trying to prepare for a challenging week. \n\nI should also consider common AITA responses. Often, these depend on communication and mutual understanding. If the husband communicated his concerns and the wife still refuses, maybe there's a misunderstanding. But the husband's request is practical. It's not unreasonable to ask someone to do in advance what they usually do. Unless there's more context, like the wife being overburdened, the husband isn't in the wrong. So the answer is B (No).\n"
