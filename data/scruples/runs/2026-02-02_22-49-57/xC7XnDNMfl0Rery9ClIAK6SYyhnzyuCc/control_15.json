She got really upset and told me that's too much work to ask of her and if it gets too hard I can just make them sandwiches. I just don't want to deal with the meltdowns that will probably come with not having the food that our kids are used to.

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The situation is that the husband wants his wife to meal prep before her trip so he can handle the kids and chores while she's away. The wife is upset because she thinks it's too much work.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife is going on her first trip since the kids were born, so the husband is stepping up to take over her usual chores. Cooking is her responsibility, but the kids are picky, and she knows their preferences better. The husband's request seems reasonable because he wants to avoid meltdowns from the kids if the food isn't right. \n\nBut why is the wife upset? Maybe she's already stressed about the trip. Meal prepping for a week could be time-consuming and physically taxing. The husband is asking her to do extra work right before she leaves, which might add to her stress. Also, she's been the main cook, so the husband might be asking her to do something that's part of her usual role, but timing is an issue here.\n\nThe key points: Is it fair to ask her to prep meals before her trip? The husband's intent is to make things easier for himself, but maybe he's not considering her workload right before she leaves. The wife's response suggests she's overwhelmed, and the husband might be underestimating how much prepping would require. \n\nOn the other hand, the husband has valid concerns about handling the kids' picky eating alone. But is it the wife's responsibility to cover that by prepping? Maybe they could have discussed this earlier. If the wife is going away, perhaps sharing responsibilities beforehand is important. But if the request came up last minute, that could be a problem.\n\nI think the husband isn't entirely wrong because he's trying to manage the situation. However, maybe he didn't consider her perspective enough. The wife might feel that the request is adding to her stress. But since cooking is her usual role, asking her to prep might be reasonable. However, the way he asked or the timing could be an issue. The wife's valid response shows she's not able or willing to do it, so the husband might need to find another solution, like adjusting the menu, getting help, or doing it himself. \n\nSo, the answer might be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because his request is reasonable, but maybe there's a middle ground. Alternatively, if the husband didn't consider her stress, maybe he's in the wrong. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong. Given that he's trying to prepare and the wife is already stressed, maybe he should have asked earlier or offered alternatives. But the wife's refusal might be due to her own workload. \n\nHmm. I think the answer is B. The husband isn't in the wrong for asking, but he could be more understanding. The wife's refusal is valid because of her own stress. So, the husband's intentions are good, but maybe the way he approached it could be better. However, the question is about whether he's in the wrong. Since he's asking for help in a reasonable way, perhaps he's not in the wrong. So B.\n"
