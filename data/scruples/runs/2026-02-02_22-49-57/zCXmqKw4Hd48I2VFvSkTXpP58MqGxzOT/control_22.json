He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. So the user wants to know if the person who posted this situation is at fault. The scenario is about a friend who's acting creepy and obsessive after a breakup, and the author told him off. The friend got angry and kicked them out. The friends agree the author was right but maybe could have been nicer.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The friend is 22, had an 8-month relationship where he was pushing for marriage, then she broke up because he was moving too fast and had anxiety. After the breakup, he's threatening self-harm, calling her repeatedly, and considering showing up at her place. The author told him he's being creepy and pathetic, leading to being kicked out.\n\nSo, the main points: The friend's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014obsessive, threatening, violating boundaries. The author is trying to help by confronting him. Even though the friend might be in emotional distress, the actions (harassment, threats) are not acceptable. The author's message is that the friend needs to stop, which is valid. The friends agree, though they suggest a nicer approach. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the friend's actions are harmful and need to be addressed. The author's intent was to help, even if the delivery could have been softer. Confronting someone when they're acting out in a harmful way isn't inherently wrong, especially if it's to prevent further issues. So the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They were pointing out necessary truths, even if the method could be improved. The key is that the behavior the author is addressing is objectively problematic, so the author's stance is justified.\n"
