He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a 22-year-old friend who broke up with his girlfriend after she ended the relationship because he was moving too fast and needs to work on himself and anxiety. After the breakup, the friend is acting out by threatening self-harm, calling her repeatedly, and planning to confront her in person. The author, one of his friends, confronts him by telling him he's being \"creepy and pathetic\" and that the ex doesn't want to get back together. The friend got angry and kicked the author out. The author's friends agree with the message but think it could have been delivered nicer.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the moral aspects here. The key points are: the friend's behavior post-breakup is concerning (threats of self-harm, continuous harassment), and the author tried to intervene. The author's friends agree with the message but suggest a kinder approach. The question is whether the author was in the wrong for their intervention.\n\nThe friend's actions are definitely problematic. Threatening self-harm is serious and might require professional help. Continuously calling the ex after being told to stop is stalker-like and not healthy. The author is trying to help by pointing out the behavior and the reality that the ex doesn't want to reconcile. The author's friends support the message, which is important because it shows that the concern isn't isolated.\n\nNow, the author's method: they told the friend directly that he was being creepy and pathetic. While the message was correct, the delivery might have been harsh. The friends think it could have been said nicer. However, sometimes when someone is emotionally overwhelmed, they might not take gentle advice well. The author's intent was to help, not to attack, but the words chosen may have been too confrontational. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for the content of the message because they were trying to address harmful behavior. However, the manner in which they delivered the message might have been an issue. The friend's reaction (getting angry and kicking the author out) could be a result of the harsh words rather than the message itself. But the core of the message is valid. The author is not the asshole here; they were trying to help, even if the delivery could have been improved. \n\nSo the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The intervention was necessary, and the friends concur. The harsh delivery is a separate issue from the correctness of the message.\n"
