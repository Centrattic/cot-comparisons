He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the friend was in a relationship that ended because he was moving too fast and dealing with anxiety. After the breakup, he's threatening self-harm, calling the ex constantly, and even considering showing up at her place. The author, along with friends, tried to support him, but when the friend kept talking about getting her back, the author snapped and called him out. The friend was upset and kicked them out. The friends agree with the author but think maybe a nicer approach could have worked.\n\nSo, the key points here: the author was trying to help a friend who's in emotional distress, but the method might have been harsh. The question is whether the author was wrong for confronting the friend directly about his creepy behavior.\n\nI need to consider the context. The friend is in crisis, threatening self-harm. The author's actions might have been a last-ditch effort to get through to him. While the friend is in a vulnerable state, the author's harsh words could have been necessary to prevent further harm. However, maybe a softer approach could have been more effective. But the author's intentions were good\u2014trying to protect the ex and help the friend. Also, friends agreed with the author, so maybe it's justified. The alternative is letting the friend spiral further.\n\nBut is it the author's fault for speaking up? The friend was already causing harm to himself and others. The author's words might have been the right message, even if delivered bluntly. So, probably not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
