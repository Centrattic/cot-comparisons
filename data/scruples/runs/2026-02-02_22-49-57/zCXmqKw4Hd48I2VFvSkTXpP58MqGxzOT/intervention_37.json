He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe friend was in an 8-month relationship where he was pushing for marriage and stuff. Then she broke up because he was moving too fast and dealing with anxiety. After the breakup, he's having a breakdown, calls 911 because he was threatening self-harm. He keeps calling the ex, even threatening to go to her place. The author and friends are helping him, but when the author tells him he's being creepy and pathetic, saying to stop, he gets angry and kicks them out. Friends say maybe the author could have been nicer but agree with the message.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and to stop contacting the ex. The author's friends agree with the message but think the delivery could have been nicer. \n\nOn one hand, the ex has clearly said no, so the friend is harassing her. The author is trying to help by telling him to stop. On the other hand, maybe the approach was harsh, but the intent is good. The friend is in a fragile state, so maybe a softer approach is better, but the content of the message is valid. Creepy behavior is problematic, so calling him out on that seems right. The author probably isn't in the wrong because the content is justified, even if the delivery could be improved. The friend's actions are wrong, so the author is helping him realize that. So answer B.\n"
