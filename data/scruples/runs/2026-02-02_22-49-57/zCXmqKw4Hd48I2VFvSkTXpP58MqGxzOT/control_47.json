He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a friend who's acting really poorly after a breakup, and the author confronts him.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the facts. The friend was in a relationship for eight months, made big commitments early on, then the girlfriend broke up because he was moving too fast and needed to work on himself and his anxiety. After the breakup, the friend had a mental breakdown, called 911, was hospitalized, and then kept trying to contact the ex, even threatening to go to her place. The author, frustrated, told him he was being creepy and pathetic, leading to the friend kicking them out. Friends agree with the author's sentiment but think the delivery could have been better.\n\nSo, the key points here are the friend's behavior post-breakup. He's engaging in stalking-like behavior (constant calls, threatening to show up), which is definitely concerning and potentially harmful. The author is trying to stop this by confronting him. The question is whether the author's approach was wrong.\n\nThe author's message was direct and confrontational, using strong language like \"creepy and pathetic,\" which might have been harsh. However, the friend's actions are clearly problematic and could escalate. The author's intention was to stop harmful behavior, which is a valid concern. While the delivery could be improved, the content of the message is justified. The friend's friends also agree with the author, indicating that the concern is shared.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for pointing out the friend's inappropriate behavior. The main issue is the method\u2014maybe a more calm, supportive approach could have been better, but the message itself is correct. The friend's actions are the real problem here. So the answer should be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
