He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who told their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who was in a relationship that ended because he moved too fast. After the breakup, he's acting out\u2014threatening self-harm, calling the ex constantly, and considering showing up uninvited. The author, after trying to support him but getting frustrated, confronts him and tells him off. He gets angry and kicks them out. Friends agree with the author but said maybe a nicer approach.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was wrong to confront their friend. Let me consider the key points. The author's friend is exhibiting behaviors that are not only harmful to himself (threats of self-harm) but also potentially harassing the ex. The author intervened by calling out the behavior as creepy and pathetic, which the friend took as an attack. The friends agree with the author's stance but think the delivery could have been softer.\n\nLegally, if someone is making threats of self-harm or harassment, informing others or intervening could be seen as responsible. However, the method of confrontation matters. The author's approach might have been harsh, but the intent was to help. The friend's actions are problematic, and the author tried to support him before losing patience. The key here is whether the author's words were justified given the context. Since the ex has clearly indicated no interest in reconciliation and the friend's behavior is extreme, the author's intervention was aimed at stopping harmful actions. The friend's reaction (getting angry and kicking them out) shows the confrontation was intense. However, the author's friends support the action, which suggests the behavior was indeed concerning. So, the author isn't in the wrong for pointing out the creepy behavior, even if the delivery could have been kinder. The main issue is the friend's actions, not the author's intervention. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
