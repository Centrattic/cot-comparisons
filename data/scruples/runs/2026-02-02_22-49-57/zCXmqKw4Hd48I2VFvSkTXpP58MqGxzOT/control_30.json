He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The question is whether the author did the right thing by telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. The friend was moving too fast in the relationship, got dumped, then started threatening self-harm and stalking behavior.\n\nSo first, the friend's actions after the breakup are definitely problematic. Calling 911 because he was threatening harm on himself shows he's in a crisis. Then constantly contacting the ex, wanting to confront her in person, and not respecting her decision to end things. That's not normal behavior post-breakup. The author and friends tried to help him, but when the author finally snapped and told him off, he got angry and kicked them out.\n\nThe author says they told the friend he's being creepy and pathetic. The key here is that the friend's actions cross boundaries. The ex has made it clear she doesn't want to get back together, yet he's persisting in a way that's not healthy. The author's friends agree with them, though they think a nicer approach might have worked.\n\nBut the main issue is whether the author was wrong to confront the friend. The friend's behavior is harmful and needs to stop. The author is trying to prevent further harm, both to the ex and to the friend himself. Even if the approach was harsh, the intent was to help. The friend's response was to lash out, but that doesn't mean the author was in the wrong. The author's friends support them, which suggests that the concern is valid.\n\nSo, considering the context, the author was right to stand up to their friend and point out the problematic behavior. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
