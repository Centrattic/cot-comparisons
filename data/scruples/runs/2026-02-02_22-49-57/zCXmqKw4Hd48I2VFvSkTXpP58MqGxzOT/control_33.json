He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is at fault for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the friend was in a relationship that ended because he was moving too fast and had anxiety issues. After the breakup, he's acting out\u2014threatening suicide, calling the ex constantly, considering showing up at her place. The author steps in and tells him he's being creepy and needs to stop. The friend gets upset and kicks them out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nSo, I need to consider the context. The friend's behavior is clearly problematic. He's not handling the breakup well, which is causing harm to himself and others. The author's intervention was direct but necessary. They called out his behavior, which others agree with, even if they thought it could have been phrased better. \n\nBut the key point is whether the author overstepped. They were trying to help, and the friend's actions were unhealthy. The author's message\u2014that the ex isn't interested and he needs to stop\u2014is valid. Even if the delivery could have been kinder, the content itself isn't wrong. The friend's actions are concerning, and the author was advocating for healthier behavior.\n\nAlso, considering the friend's mental state, the author might have a responsibility to intervene, especially since the friend was hospitalized. The author's friends support the action, suggesting it's a common-sense approach. So, while the manner could have been improved, the author isn't in the wrong for the message itself.\n"
