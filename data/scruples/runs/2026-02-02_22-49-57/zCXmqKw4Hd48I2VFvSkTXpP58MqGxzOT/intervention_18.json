He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe friend was in an eight-month relationship where he kept talking about marriage and moving too fast. The girl broke up with him because he needed to work on himself and his anxiety. After the breakup, the friend started threatening suicide, calling the girl repeatedly, and considering showing up at her place. The author, along with friends, tried to help but finally snapped when the friend was still obsessed with getting her back. The author told him he was being creepy and pathetic, leading to a fight and being kicked out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and emotional aspects here. The friend's behavior after the breakup is clearly problematic\u2014threatening self-harm, stalking behavior, and not respecting the girl's decision. The author's friends agree with them, albeit with a suggestion to be nicer. \n\nThe author's action was to confront the friend directly when he was in a vulnerable state. While the method might be harsh, the content of the message is valid. The friend needs to understand that his actions are harmful. The author is trying to help a friend who's in emotional distress but is acting out of concern rather than malice. \n\nIs there a line crossed? The author is in a supportive role here. They called out harmful behavior, which is necessary even if it's blunt. The key point is whether the author's words were justified given the context. Since the friend was already in crisis and the behavior was unacceptable, the author's intervention seems appropriate. The answer is likely B, not in the wrong.\n"
