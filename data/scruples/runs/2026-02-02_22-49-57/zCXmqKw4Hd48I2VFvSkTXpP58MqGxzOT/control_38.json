He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully. The friend was in an eight-month relationship and was moving too fast, leading to the breakup. After the breakup, he's been acting out\u2014calling the girl, threatening self-harm, and wanting to go to her place. The author intervened by telling him he's being creepy and pathetic, which led to the friend getting angry and kicking them out. The friends think the author could have been nicer but agree with the message.\n\nFirst, the friend's behavior is definitely concerning. Threatening self-harm is a serious issue and 911 was called, which is the right step. The friend is also persistently trying to reconnect with the ex, which is not healthy. The author's words were direct but necessary. The friend's actions are crossing boundaries, so pointing that out isn't wrong. The friend's reaction was to kick the author out, but that's their own response, not the author's fault. The friends support the message, even if they think it could have been delivered more gently. So, the author isn't in the wrong for confronting the friend about harmful behavior. The answer should be B.\n"
