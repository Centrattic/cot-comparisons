He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who's acting creepy and obsessive after a breakup. The author confronts their friend and tells them to stop, leading to the friend kicking them out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The friend was in a relationship that ended because he was moving too fast and had anxiety issues. After the breakup, he's threatening self-harm, calling the ex constantly, and wanting to confront her in person. The author steps in to tell him he's being creepy and needs to stop. The friend reacts angrily and kicks the author out. The author's friends agree with them but say they could have been nicer.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was right to confront the friend. The friend's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014threatening self-harm, stalking, etc. The author is trying to help their friend by stopping the harmful behavior. While the confrontation method might have been harsh, the intent was good. The friends agree with the message even if the delivery could have been better. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for pointing out the friend's bad behavior. The friend needed to hear it to stop, even if it caused a temporary fallout. The key here is that the author was trying to prevent further harm to the friend and the ex. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
