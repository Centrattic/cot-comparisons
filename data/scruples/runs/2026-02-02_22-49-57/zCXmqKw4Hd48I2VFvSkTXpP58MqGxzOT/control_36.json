He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend breaking up with his girlfriend, then acting out by threatening suicide, following her, and the author telling him he's being creepy and pathetic.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The friend was moving too fast in the relationship, which led to the breakup. After the breakup, he's having a mental health crisis, threatening self-harm, and persistently trying to get his ex back, even considering showing up at her place. The author confronts him, tells him he's being creepy and to stop, leading to a fallout.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong for confronting him. The author's friends agree with the message but think the delivery could have been nicer. The friend's actions are definitely concerning and potentially harmful\u2014harassment, possible stalking, and mental health issues. The author is trying to intervene to stop this behavior, which is harmful to both the ex and the friend.\n\nOn one hand, the author might have handled it more gently, but the content of the message is valid. The ex has made it clear she doesn't want to get back together, so the friend's actions are indeed creepy. The author's intervention could prevent further harm. On the other hand, the friend is in a vulnerable state, and maybe a more empathetic approach was needed. However, the severity of the friend's behavior (threats, stalking) justifies the confrontation. The author isn't attacking the person but the harmful behavior.\n\nSo, the answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They were trying to stop their friend from acting in a way that's dangerous and inappropriate, even if the delivery could have been better. The core message is right.\n"
