He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The scenario is about a friend who's acting creepy and desperate after a breakup, and the author called him out for it.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The friend was in a relationship that ended because he was moving too fast and had anxiety issues. After the breakup, he's acting out\u2014threatening suicide, calling the ex, and wanting to confront her. The author, along with friends, tried to help him but eventually snapped and told him he was being creepy and pathetic. The friend got angry and kicked the author out.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Let me consider both sides. On one hand, the author was trying to intervene when their friend was in a dangerous emotional state. The friend's behavior\u2014calling the ex repeatedly, threatening self-harm, possibly showing up at her place\u2014is definitely problematic and could be considered stalking or harassment. The author's friends agree with the message even if they think the delivery could have been nicer. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might have been too harsh in their delivery, using words like \"creepy\" and \"pathetic,\" which could come off as judgmental. However, given the context, the intent was to stop harmful behavior, not to belittle. The alternative might be inaction, which could let the behavior continue. \n\nThe key points are the severity of the friend's actions and the author's intent to help. While the method could have been kinder, the message was necessary. The friend's actions are clearly problematic, so the author's intervention, though direct, was in the right direction. The friends' agreement also supports that the author wasn't wrong. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The author acted to prevent further harm, even if the approach could have been softer. The priority was stopping dangerous behavior, which justifies the intervention.\n"
