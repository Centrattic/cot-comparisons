He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. \n\nFirst, the friend was in a relationship where he was moving too fast and making big promises. The girl broke up with him because he wasn't working on himself and his anxiety. After the breakup, the friend had a mental health crisis, called 911, and was hospitalized. Now, he's obsessively trying to get her back, threatening self-harm, and wanting to confront her. The author, frustrated after hearing this multiple times, finally told him he was being creepy and pathetic. The friend got angry and kicked them out. Friends think the author could have been nicer but agree with the message.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the friend's behavior is clearly unhealthy and potentially dangerous. The author is trying to help their friend by calling out this behavior. Even though the friend was in a vulnerable state, the author's intent was to stop the harmful actions. The friends agree with the message, even if the delivery was harsh. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, the friend's actions (harassment, threats, stalking) are problematic. The author is pointing out the reality of the situation. While the delivery might have been harsh, the content is valid. The author wasn't attacking the friend's character but the specific behaviors. So, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They were trying to help their friend stop harmful actions, even if the approach could be improved. The friend's mental health issues don't justify the behavior, and the author had a right to express concern.\n"
