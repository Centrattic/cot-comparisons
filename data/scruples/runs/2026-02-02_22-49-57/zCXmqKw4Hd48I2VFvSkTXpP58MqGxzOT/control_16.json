He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who's acting really obsessively after a breakup, and the author told him he was being creepy and pathetic. So the core question is whether the author's response was appropriate.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The friend was in a relationship for 8 months, made grandiose claims about marriage, then the breakup happened because he was moving too fast and needed to work on his anxiety. After the breakup, he's threatening suicide, calling the ex, and considering showing up uninvited. The author, frustrated, calls him out for being creepy and pathetic, leading to the friend kicking them out. The friends agree the author is right but maybe could have been nicer.\n\nNow, the key points here. The friend is clearly in a vulnerable state, with mental health issues (anxiety and suicidal thoughts). The author's intervention was during a time when the friend was already in crisis. The author's words were direct and harsh, which might not consider the friend's emotional state. Even though the friends agree the behavior was wrong, the author's approach could have been more empathetic. The author's intent was to stop harmful behavior, but the method might have been too harsh given the friend's mental state.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend's actions are definitely concerning and inappropriate. The author is trying to help by addressing the behavior. However, the way it was done might not have been effective or compassionate. The friend was in a state where he needed support, not criticism. The author's frustration is understandable, but in a crisis, communication style matters. Using words like \"creepy\" and \"pathetic\" could have been hurtful and counterproductive, even if accurate.\n\nSo, the balance here is between the right to call out harmful behavior and the method used in a vulnerable situation. The author isn't entirely wrong because the friend's actions needed to be addressed. But the approach might have been inappropriate given the context. The answer might hinge on whether the harsh words were necessary or if a more supportive approach could have been better. Since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer would depend on whether their approach was justifiable. Given the friend's state, the author's harshness might have been unhelpful, even if the message was correct. So, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong for the content of the message but perhaps in the delivery. However, since the options are A or B, and the user wants a binary choice, the answer is B (No), because the author was right to address the behavior, even if the delivery could have been better.\n"
