He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong (AITA). The situation is about a friend who's acting creepy after a breakup. The writer told their friend he was being creepy and pathetic, which led to the friend kicking them out.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The friend was in a relationship that ended because he was moving too fast. After the breakup, he's threatening self-harm, calling the ex constantly, and planning to confront her. The writer and friends intervened by calling 911, which shows they were concerned about his safety. Then, the writer confronts him, telling him to stop being creepy, which the friend didn't take well.\n\nNow, considering the actions. The writer's friend is exhibiting stalking or obsessive behavior, which is definitely not okay. The writer tried to help by pointing this out, even if the method was harsh. The key points here are intent and proportionality. The writer's intent was to help a friend who was in emotional distress and potentially harmful to himself and others. The response, while direct, might have been necessary given the situation. However, the writer could have been more empathetic in delivery, but the friends agreed with the message.\n\nEthically, is the writer in the wrong? Probably not, because they were trying to prevent further harm. The friend's behavior was problematic, and the writer was honest about it. Even if the delivery was harsh, the intent was good. The answer might be B (not in the wrong). But I need to check if there's any aspect where the writer overstepped. Since the writer was part of a group effort to help, their actions seem justified. So the answer is B.\n"
