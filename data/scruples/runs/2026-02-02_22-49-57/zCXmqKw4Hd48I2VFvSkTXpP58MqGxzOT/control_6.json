He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who told their friend he was being creepy and pathetic after a breakup is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation step by step.\n\nFirst, the friend was in a relationship that ended because he was moving too fast and had anxiety issues. She broke up with him. After the breakup, he's been acting out\u2014call 911 because he was threatening self-harm, making threats towards her, and trying to confront her. The author steps in and tells him he's being creepy and needs to stop, which leads to a conflict.\n\nSo, the key points here are the friend's behavior post-breakup. He's not handling it well, which is leading to potentially dangerous actions. The author is trying to intervene to stop him from doing something worse. The question is whether the author was right to confront him directly.\n\nI know that when someone is in emotional distress, especially after a breakup, their judgment can be impaired. The author's friend is at risk of acting on harmful impulses. The author's friends agree with the message but think the delivery could have been nicer. The author's main issue is that the friend isn't respecting the ex's wishes and is being intrusive.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the friend's actions are concerning and could be dangerous. The author is trying to protect both their friend and the ex by making him stop. Even if the delivery was harsh, the intent was to help. However, maybe there's a better way to handle it, but the situation seems urgent. The author isn't being cruel without reason; they're addressing actual harmful behavior. The friend's actions are what's problematic here, not the author's intervention. So the answer would be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
