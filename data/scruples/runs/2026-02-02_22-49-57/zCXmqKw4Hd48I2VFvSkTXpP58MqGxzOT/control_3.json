He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who told their friend he was being creepy and pathetic after a breakup is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the friend was in a relationship that ended because he was moving too fast and had anxiety issues. After the breakup, he's behaving in a way that's concerning: threatening self-harm, repeatedly contacting the ex, and even considering showing up at her place uninvited. The author intervened by confronting him directly, which led to the friend getting angry and kicking them out. The friends agree with the author but think a nicer method might have worked.\n\nNow, the key points here. The friend's actions post-breakup are clearly problematic and could be considered stalking or harassment. The author's concern is valid because the friend's behavior is not healthy and could escalate. The author's approach, while direct, was to stop the harmful behavior, which is a responsible action. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nThe author's message was blunt (\"creepy and pathetic\"), which might have been harsh, but the intent was to prevent further harm. The alternative might be to let the friend continue harmful behavior, which could lead to more serious consequences. The friends also support the author, indicating that the message's content wasn't inappropriate, just possibly the delivery. \n\nSo, considering that the author was trying to help prevent the friend from acting inappropriately and that the friends agree, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
