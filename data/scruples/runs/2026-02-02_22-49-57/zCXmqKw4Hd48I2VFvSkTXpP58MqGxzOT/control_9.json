He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for confronting their friend about his behavior after a breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend was in an 8-month relationship where he was pushing for marriage, which might have been too fast. The girl broke up because he was moving too fast and had anxiety. After the breakup, the friend is acting out\u2014threatening self-harm, calling the ex repeatedly, and considering showing up at her place. The author, frustrated, tells their friend he's being creepy and pathetic and to stop. The friend gets angry and kicks them out. The friends agree with the author but think they could have been nicer.\n\nSo, the key points here are the friend's stalking/harassment behaviors post-breakup. The author is trying to stop their friend from doing something harmful. Even though the author's delivery might have been harsh, the intent was to help. The friend's actions are clearly problematic (threats of self-harm, harassment), which the author is trying to address. The question is whether the author was wrong to speak up.\n\nIn such cases, preventing someone from harassing an ex or acting on suicidal threats is important. While the author's tone could have been improved, the message was necessary. The friends' agreement supports that the author had a valid point. The friend's reaction (kicking them out) might indicate defensiveness, but that doesn't mean the author was wrong. The author was trying to intervene for the friend's and ex's well-being. So, the answer is likely B\u2014No, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
