He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend was in a relationship that ended because he was moving too fast and had anxiety issues. After the breakup, he's not handling it well\u2014calling 911 due to self-harm threats, contacting the ex constantly, and wanting to confront her. The author intervened by telling him he's being creepy and to stop, leading to a fallout.\n\nNow, the main points to consider: The friend's behavior is clearly stalking and harassing the ex, which is unhealthy and potentially dangerous. The author was concerned enough to speak up, even if it was harsh. The friends agree with the sentiment but suggest a nicer approach. \n\nIs the author at fault? Well, the friend's actions are problematic. The author was trying to help, even if the delivery was blunt. The key here is whether the content of the message (telling him to stop being creepy) is wrong. Since the friend's behavior is indeed inappropriate, the author's message is valid. However, the method could have been more compassionate. But the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" which relates to the content, not the delivery. \n\nThe author isn't at fault for pointing out harmful behavior. The friend's actions are the issue, and the author was trying to intervene. So the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
