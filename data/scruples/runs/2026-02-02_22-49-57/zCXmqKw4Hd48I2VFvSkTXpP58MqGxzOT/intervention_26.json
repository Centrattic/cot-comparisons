He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author did the right thing by telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. The situation is that the friend was in a relationship for eight months, made big commitments like marriage, but the girl broke up because he was moving too fast. Then he had a mental health crisis, called 911, and kept trying to get back with her, even threatening self-harm. The author told him to stop being creepy and pathetic, leading to a fight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The friend's behavior after the breakup is clearly problematic. He's not respecting the other person's wishes, making threats, and has mental health issues. The author intervened to stop the friend from continuing harmful behavior. The friends agree with the author's stance but think the approach could have been nicer.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. The main factors here are the intent and the necessity of the intervention. The author was trying to protect both the friend and the ex by stopping stalking or harassment behaviors. While the method might have been harsh, the motivation was to help, which is important. The friend needed to hear that his actions were wrong, even if the delivery was direct.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend was in a vulnerable state, possibly dealing with anxiety and depression. The author's approach could have been more empathetic, but the message was necessary. The fact that the friend kicked them out doesn't necessarily mean the author is wrong; the friend's reaction might be due to his emotional state.\n\nSo, considering the context, the author isn't in the wrong. They acted to stop harmful behavior, even if the delivery could have been softer. The main goal was to protect everyone involved. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
