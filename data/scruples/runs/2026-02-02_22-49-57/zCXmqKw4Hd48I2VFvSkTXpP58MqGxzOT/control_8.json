He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person in the AITA scenario) is in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup.\n\nFirst, the friend was in a relationship for eight months, made grandiose claims about marriage, and then the girl broke up because he moved too fast and needed to work on himself and his anxiety. The friend had a mental breakdown, called 911, and was hospitalized. After that, he keeps threatening self-harm, calls the ex constantly, wants to confront her in person, and the author tells him he's being creepy and pathetic. The friend got angry and kicked the author out. The author's friends agree with them but think they could have been nicer.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author overstepped by calling their friend creepy. The friend's behavior is clearly unhealthy: threatening self-harm, stalking behavior, not respecting the ex's wishes. The author intervened to stop this toxic behavior. The friend's actions could be harmful to himself and the ex. The author's friends support them, though they suggest a kinder approach.\n\nThe question is about right vs. wrong. The author's intent was to help the friend, not be cruel. They were frustrated after multiple attempts by the friend to pursue the ex. The friend's actions are not okay, so pointing out that he's being creepy is valid. However, the friend is also in a vulnerable state after a breakup and a mental health crisis. The author might have delivered the message harshly, but the core message (he needs to stop) is correct. The friends agree with the message but think the delivery could be softer. So, the author is not in the wrong for the content of the message, but maybe in the tone. However, the scenario asks if the author is in the wrong, not if they could have done it better. Since the action was to stop harmful behavior, the author is justified. So the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
