He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling a friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. The friend was in a relationship that ended because he was moving too fast and had anxiety. After the breakup, he started threatening suicide and stalking the ex, even getting hospitalized. The author confronted him, told him he's being creepy and to stop, and got kicked out. Friends agreed with the author but said maybe a nicer approach could have worked.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The friend's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014threatening suicide, constant calls, threatening the ex. The author tried to intervene constructively, even if the delivery was harsh. The key points here are the friend's harmful actions versus the author's intentions to help. The author's actions were meant to stop the friend from causing more harm, which is understandable. Friends agree with the message, even if the delivery could have been softer. The author didn't act out of malice but concern. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
