He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. The situation is that the friend was in a relationship for eight months, was moving too fast, and the girl broke up with him. After the breakup, the friend is acting out\u2014threatening self-harm, calling the ex constantly, even considering showing up at her place. The author, after multiple instances of the friend talking about getting her back, confronts him and tells him he's being creepy and pathetic. The friend then kicks them out. Friends agree with the author but think maybe a nicer approach was needed.\n\nSo, is the author at fault? Well, the friend's behavior is clearly problematic. He's not respecting her decision to end the relationship, is engaging in behaviors that could be considered harassment (constant calling, threats of showing up uninvited), and has mental health issues (anxiety, attempted self-harm). The author is trying to help their friend by pointing out the negative behavior, even if the delivery wasn't the most gentle. The key points here are intent and context. The author's intention was to help their friend realize he's acting inappropriately. The friend's actions are concerning and potentially harmful, so the author is trying to intervene. While the method could have been more compassionate, the message itself is valid. The author isn't being cruel for no reason; they're addressing harmful behavior. Therefore, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong). But I need to make sure there's no nuance I'm missing. Maybe the author overstepped by calling him \"pathetic,\" but given the context, it's a justified concern. So, the answer is B.\n"
