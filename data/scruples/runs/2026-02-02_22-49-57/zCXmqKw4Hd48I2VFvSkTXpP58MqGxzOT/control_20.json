He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who's acting creepy after a breakup, and the author confronts him. So, the question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The friend was in a relationship that ended because he was moving too fast and had anxiety issues. After the breakup, he's threatening suicide, calling the ex and others, and wanting to go to her place. The author steps in and tells him he's being creepy and pathetic, which causes a fight. The friends agree with the author's stance but think the approach could have been nicer.\n\nThe key points here are the friend's behavior post-breakup. Threatening self-harm is a serious issue. The author intervened to stop the friend from harassing the ex. The confrontation happened when the author was already supporting the friend after the hospital visit. The friends agree with the author's message but suggest a kinder delivery.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the friend's actions are clearly problematic\u2014harassment and threats. The author's message, while maybe harsh, is trying to help the friend realize the need to stop. The author's intention was to prevent further harmful behavior. However, the method of confrontation might have been too direct, leading to conflict. But the content of what was said is valid. The friend needs to stop, and the author isn't responsible for the friend's reaction. The ex's clear rejection is a key point here. The author isn't being cruel without cause; they're addressing real issues. So the answer would be B, not in the wrong.\n"
