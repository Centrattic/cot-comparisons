He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe friend was in a relationship for eight months and was really pushing for things like marriage, thinking she was \"the one.\" The girl broke up with him because he was moving too fast and he needs to work on himself, specifically his anxiety. After the breakup, he's been acting out\u2014threatening suicide, calling her constantly, and even threatening to go to her place. The author, along with other friends, has been helping him, but after multiple attempts to get him to stop, the author finally told him he was being creepy and pathetic, leading to a fight where the friend kicked them out. The author's friends think they could have said it nicer but agree with the sentiment.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is at fault. The key points here are: the friend is emotionally unstable, the author is trying to help by confronting the behavior, and the method might have been harsh but the message was right. The friend's actions are clearly unhealthy and potentially dangerous (threats of self-harm, stalking, etc.), so the author is trying to stop that. The author's friends agree with the message but maybe the delivery could be improved. But the main issue is whether the author was wrong to confront the friend.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is trying to protect the ex and prevent the friend from further self-destruction. While the way it was said might have been rough, the underlying intent is good. The friend was already being advised by others, so the author isn't the only one pushing this. The friend's reaction (kicking out) shows that he's not handling constructive criticism well, which is part of his problem.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer is likely B (No). The friend's behavior is the main issue here, and the author was trying to help despite the friend's emotional state. The harshness of the message might not be ideal, but the core message is valid and necessary. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
