He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a friend who's acting out after a breakup. The writer told their friend he was being creepy and pathetic for trying to get back with his ex, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The friend was in an eight-month relationship, made grand claims about marriage, then the girl broke up because he was moving too fast and had anxiety. After the breakup, he's threatening suicide, calling her nonstop, and considering showing up at her place. The writer confronts him, saying he's being creepy and pathetic, which angers him and he kicks the writer out. The friends agree with the writer but think they could have been nicer.\n\nSo, is the author at fault? The friend's actions are clearly concerning and unhealthy. The writer is trying to help by pointing out the friend's behavior. Even though the approach might have been harsh, the intent was to stop the friend from doing something dangerous. Friends have a responsibility to intervene when someone's actions are harmful. The writer's words might have been blunt, but the underlying message is valid. The friend's reaction could be due to his emotional state. Also, the friends support the writer, indicating that the main issue was the friend's behavior, not the writer's. So, the answer is probably B (No).\n"
