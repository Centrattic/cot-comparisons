He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author (the person who posted the situation) is in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. The friend was moving too fast in the relationship, which led to the breakup. After the breakup, the friend is acting out, threatening suicide, calling the ex, and planning to confront her. The author confronted their friend, told them they're acting creepy, and the friend kicked them out. The friends agree with the author but think they could have been nicer.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The friend is in a vulnerable state, post-breakup, and potentially suicidal. The author's friend is engaging in behaviors that are concerning\u2014threats of self-harm, stalking, harassment. The author intervenes to tell them they're being creepy and need to stop. \n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The author's actions were to stop their friend from doing something harmful. The friend's behavior is clearly problematic, so the author's intention was likely to help. However, the method might have been harsh. The author lost it after repeated instances, which could be seen as confrontational. But given the friend's mental state, maybe a harsh approach was necessary to get through to them.\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to prevent further harm, both to the ex and to their friend. Creepy behavior is not okay, and the author is right that the ex doesn't want to get back together. On the other hand, the friend was already in a crisis, and the way the author delivered the message might have been unhelpful. However, the friends agree with the author's message, even if they think a nicer approach could have been better. \n\nThe main issue is whether the author's words were justified. Saying someone is \"creepy and pathetic\" is strong language, but in the context of someone being stalk-like in their behavior, it might be warranted. The key here is that the author is trying to protect the ex and help their friend heal, even if the delivery was rough. The friend's reaction (kicking out) is a sign of defensiveness, but the author's actions were aimed at stopping harmful behavior. \n\nIn terms of moral rightness, the author isn't wrong for pointing out harmful behavior. The friend needed to hear that, even if it was delivered bluntly. The alternative would be to ignore the behavior, which could lead to more harm. So, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong, even if their approach could be improved.\n"
