He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is at fault. The situation involves a friend who's acting inappropriately after a breakup, and the author confronted him. \n\nFirst, the friend was in a relationship that ended because he moved too fast. Now, he's threatening self-harm, calling his ex, and even considering showing up uninvited. The author, along with friends, tried to support him, but when the friend kept talking about getting her back, the author snapped and told him he's being creepy and pathetic. The friend kicked them out, and the author is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider the key points here. The author's intervention was to stop the friend from acting in a way that's creepy and potentially dangerous. The friend's behavior is clearly unhealthy\u2014threatening self-harm, harassment, etc. The author's friends agreed with the message even if the delivery could have been softer. The author isn't attacking the friend's feelings but the behavior. \n\nIs the author at fault for pointing out the friend's harmful actions? The friend's behavior is a problem, and the author was trying to help. Even if the confrontation was harsh, the intent was positive. The main question is whether the content of the message is wrong. Since the friend is in crisis, the author's warning was necessary. So the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
