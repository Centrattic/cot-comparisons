He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down the situation. The user is asking if the person who told their friend he was being creepy and pathetic after a breakup is in the wrong. The friend had a toxic relationship where he was rushing things, and after the breakup, he's acting out by threatening himself, calling the ex, and wanting to confront her. The author intervened, telling him to stop, which led to the friend kicking them out.\n\nFirst, the friend's behavior is clearly problematic. He's threatening self-harm, stalking, and harassment. The author and friends are trying to help, which is a good intention. The author's approach might not have been the gentlest, but the core message\u2014that the friend needs to stop\u2014is valid. The friends agree with the message even if they thought the delivery could be smoother. \n\nThe key points here are that the author is trying to prevent harm to both the ex and their friend. The friend's actions are harmful and need to stop, so the author is justified in calling them out. While the method could have been more compassionate, the intent is positive, and the outcome (the friend kicking them out) doesn't negate the rightness of the intervention. So, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
