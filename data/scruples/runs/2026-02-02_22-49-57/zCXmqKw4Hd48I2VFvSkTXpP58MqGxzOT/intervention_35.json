He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. \n\nFirst, the friend was in a relationship that ended because he was moving too fast and needed to work on his anxiety. After the breakup, he's acting out by threatening self-harm, calling the ex constantly, planning to visit her uninvited, and the author's friends had to call 911. \n\nThe author intervened, told the friend he's being creepy and to stop, and the friend kicked them out. The friends agree with the author but think they could have been nicer.\n\nSo, the key points here are the friend's behavior post-breakup: threatening self-harm, stalking, harassment. The author is trying to help by stopping the friend from continuing these harmful actions. Even though the approach might have been harsh, the intention was to prevent further issues. The friends agree, so there's support for the author's stance. \n\nThe question is about right and wrong. The author isn't in the wrong because they were trying to protect both the friend and the ex. The friend's actions are inappropriate, and the author's intervention, while maybe not the nicest, was necessary. So the answer is B.\n"
