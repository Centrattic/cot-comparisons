He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who's acting really obsessively after a breakup. The friend was threatening suicide, calling the ex constantly, and even considering showing up at her place. The author confronted him, told him he was being creepy and pathetic, and said to stop. Then the friend kicked them out. The friends think the author was right but could have been nicer.\n\nSo, first, the friend is in a very unhealthy state after the breakup. The ex wants him to stop contacting her, and he's not complying. The author is trying to help by telling him to stop, even if the approach was harsh. The friend's behavior is definitely concerning\u2014self-harm threats, stalking-like behavior. The author's intent was to help prevent harm to both the friend and the ex. The main question is whether the confrontation was wrong. The friends agree that the message was right but the delivery could have been better. So the author isn't in the wrong because they were trying to stop harmful behavior. The answer should be B (No).\n"
