He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. The friend was in a relationship for eight months, moved too fast, got dumped, and then started threatening suicide and stalking the ex. The author confronted him, said he's being creepy and pathetic, and got kicked out. Friends say the approach could have been nicer but agree with the sentiment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014calling the ex repeatedly, threatening self-harm, and wanting to approach her in person. The author is trying to help a friend in crisis, even calling 911 and spending time with him. The confrontation happened after multiple attempts to reach out to the ex, which the ex clearly didn't want.\n\nThe author's message was direct and harsh, but it was in response to harmful behavior. The friend might have felt that the author was being too harsh, but the friends agree with the sentiment even if the delivery could be softer. The key point is whether the content of the message (calling him creepy and pathetic) was justified.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't the one causing the problem. They're trying to intervene in a situation where the friend is acting in a way that's harmful to himself and others. The ex's boundaries are clear, so the author is right to reinforce them. Even if the delivery could be improved, the message itself is valid. The author isn't in the wrong for pointing out the friend's problematic behavior. So the answer is B.\n"
