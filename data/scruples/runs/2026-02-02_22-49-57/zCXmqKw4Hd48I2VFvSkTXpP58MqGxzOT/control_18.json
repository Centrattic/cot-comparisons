He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nThe friend was in an 8-month relationship and was moving too fast, leading the girl to break up. The friend's response was extreme, threatening self-harm, calling her and others, and even considering showing up at her place. The author told their friend he was being creepy and pathetic, which led to a conflict and the friend kicking them out. Their friends agree with them but think they could have been nicer.\n\nFirst, the author's actions: they directly confronted their friend, maybe a bit harshly, but the friend's behavior was definitely problematic. Threatening self-harm is a red flag, and the friend's actions post-breakup are obsessive and potentially harmful. The author was trying to help, pointing out that the friend is not respecting the girl's wishes. The key here is whether the author's approach was appropriate. While being confrontational might not be the best method, the intent was to stop harmful behavior. The friend's actions could be dangerous, so the author's message was necessary. The friends also agree, so maybe they see the same issues. However, the tone might be an issue, but the content is justified. So the author isn't in the wrong, but could have handled it better. The answer should be B.\n"
