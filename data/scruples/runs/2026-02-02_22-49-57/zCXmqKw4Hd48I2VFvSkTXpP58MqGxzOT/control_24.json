He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. The friend was moving too fast in the relationship, which led to the breakup. After that, the friend is acting out by threatening harm, constant calls, and planning to go to her place. The author confronted him, leading to the friend kicking them out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The friend's behavior is concerning\u2014threats of self-harm and persistent contact after a breakup. The author and friends have been helping him post-hospital. The author's outburst was during their turn to spend time with him. The author's friends agree with the message but think it could have been delivered nicer.\n\nThe key points here are the friend's well-being, the appropriateness of the author's words, and the potential for the friend's behavior to escalate. The author's intention was to stop the friend's unhealthy actions. While the words used were harsh, the intent was protective. However, the method of delivery could be a factor. Telling someone they're \"pathetic\" might come off as dismissive, even if the message is valid. The author could have used a calmer, more supportive approach to avoid making the friend defensive. But the content of what was said\u2014pointing out creepy behavior and the need to stop\u2014is correct. The friend needs to respect the ex's boundaries. The author isn't in the wrong for the content, but the delivery could have been better. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
