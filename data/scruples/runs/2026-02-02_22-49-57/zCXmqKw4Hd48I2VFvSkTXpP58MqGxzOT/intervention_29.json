He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. The situation is a bit intense. The friend was in a relationship that ended because he was moving too fast and has anxiety. After the breakup, he's acting out\u2014threatening self-harm, calling the ex constantly, wanting to confront her. The author intervened, told their friend to stop, which led to a fallout.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author's actions were justified. The key points here are the friend's behavior post-breakup. Threatening self-harm is serious and might require immediate help, which they did address by calling 911. The friend is also harassing the ex, which is definitely concerning. The author, after multiple instances, told their friend he was being creepy and pathetic, which the friend took as an insult and kicked them out. The friends agree with the author but think the approach could have been kinder.\n\nSo, the author's intention was to help their friend, even if the delivery was harsh. The friend's actions are problematic and potentially dangerous. The author's message, though direct, is pointing out the reality of the situation. The friend was already in crisis, so maybe a softer approach is better, but the content of the message is valid. The author isn't encouraging the behavior; they're trying to stop it. The fact that friends support the author suggests it's a reasonable stance. However, the author might have been too harsh in their wording. But considering the context, the core message is correct. The author isn't in the wrong for trying to help their friend, even if the delivery could be improved. So the answer should be B.\n"
