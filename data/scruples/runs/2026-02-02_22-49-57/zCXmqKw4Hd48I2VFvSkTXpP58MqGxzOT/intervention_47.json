He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who's acting out after a breakup. The key points are:\n\n1. The friend was in an 8-month relationship where he was pushing for marriage, which the girl didn't want. She broke up with him because he was moving too fast and he has anxiety issues that need work.\n2. After the breakup, the friend is threatening self-harm, being stalk-like, and calling the ex constantly. The author and friends had to call 911 because of his behavior.\n3. The author, after trying to support him, finally snaps and tells him he's being creepy and pathetic, leading to a fight and being kicked out.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for confronting the friend. The author's friends agree with the sentiment but think the delivery could have been kinder. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants confirmation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend's behavior is harmful and potentially dangerous. The author is trying to help by calling out the behavior, which is necessary for the friend's well-being and the ex's safety. However, the delivery was harsh. The author's friends support the message but not the tone.\n\nIn such cases, the content of the message is important. The friend's actions are indeed problematic, and someone needs to address it. The author's approach might have been direct and maybe lacking in empathy, but the intent was to help. The friend was already in a crisis, so the author's frustration might be understandable. However, the method could have been more constructive to maintain the friendship and encourage change without alienating the friend.\n\nBut the core issue is whether the author was wrong to speak up. Since the behavior is harmful, pointing it out isn't the issue. The problem might be the approach, but the question is about being in the wrong. The author isn't at fault for expressing concern, especially when the friend is in crisis. The answer would likely be B (not in the wrong), as the message was valid even if the delivery could have been smoother.\n"
