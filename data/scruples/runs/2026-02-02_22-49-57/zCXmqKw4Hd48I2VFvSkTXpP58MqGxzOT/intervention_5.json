He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. The friend was in a relationship for eight months, the girl broke up with him because he was moving too fast and needed to work on himself. After the breakup, the friend threatened self-harm, got hospitalization, and keeps contacting the ex, even threatening to go to her place. The author, after hearing this multiple times, confronts the friend, calls him creepy and pathetic, and gets kicked out. Friends agree with the author but think they could have been nicer.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The key points here are the friend's behavior post-breakup. He's threatening self-harm, which is a serious mental health issue. He's also persistently contacting the ex, which could be considered harassment or stalking. The author is trying to intervene to stop this harmful behavior. \n\nThe author's actions: directly confronting the friend when they clearly see that the behavior is inappropriate. The friend's actions are not just about being sad after a breakup; they're escalating and potentially dangerous. The author is trying to protect the ex from harassment and prevent the friend from harming himself further. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The friend's actions are problematic, and the author is pointing out the reality of the situation. Even though the confrontation was harsh, the intent was to stop harmful behavior. Friends agree with the author, indicating that the core concern was valid. \n\nHowever, the method of confrontation could have been smoother. The friend was in a vulnerable state, so being direct and using strong language might not have been the best approach. But the underlying issue\u2014stopping the friend from becoming a stalker or causing self-harm\u2014is serious. The author isn't in the wrong for addressing the problem, even if the delivery could have been improved. \n\nSo, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong. They were trying to prevent further harm, and their friends agree. The key is the justification of their actions versus the method. The method isn't perfect, but the intent and necessity to intervene are valid.\n"
