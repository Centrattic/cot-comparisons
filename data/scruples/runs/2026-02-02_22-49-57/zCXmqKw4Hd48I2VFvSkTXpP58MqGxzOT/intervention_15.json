He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the person who told their friend he's acting creepy and pathetic after a breakup is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who was in a relationship that ended because he moved too fast and had anxiety issues. After the breakup, he's acting out by threatening self-harm, calling the ex constantly, and planning to confront her. The author intervened by telling him to stop, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the actions of both parties. The friend's behavior is clearly problematic: threatening self-harm is a red flag, and the stalking-like behavior (constant calls, threatening to show up unannounced) is inappropriate and potentially dangerous. The ex has made it clear she doesn't want to get back together, so the friend isn't respecting her boundaries. \n\nThe author's action was to confront the friend about this behavior, pointing out that he's being creepy and needs to stop. Friends told the author they agree but maybe the approach could have been nicer. However, the key here is that the author is trying to prevent further harm\u2014both to the ex and to the friend's mental health. \n\nEthically, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. The friend's actions are harmful and need to be addressed. The author's intervention, while maybe harsh, is in line with supporting the friend's well-being and respecting the ex's wishes. Even if the delivery could have been softer, the intent was to help. The friend's reaction (kicking out the author) seems like an overreaction given the context. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). The author was acting in a supportive and responsible way, even if the friend didn't take it well. The main issue is the friend's behavior post-breakup, not the author's honest feedback.\n"
