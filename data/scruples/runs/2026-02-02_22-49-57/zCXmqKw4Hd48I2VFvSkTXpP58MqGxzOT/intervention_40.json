He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. The friend was with his girlfriend for eight months, but she broke up with him because he was moving too fast and needed to work on himself and his anxiety. After the breakup, the friend started threatening self-harm, was hospitalized, and keeps contacting the ex, even considering going to her place.\n\nThe author intervened after hearing the friend talk about getting her back multiple times. They told the friend he's being creepy and pathetic, leading to a fight where the friend kicked them out. Friends agree with the author but think they could've been nicer.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the friend's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014threatening self-harm, stalking-like actions, and not respecting the ex's decision. The author tried to stop this, even if the method was harsh. The friends support the author, so maybe they're right to step in. But maybe they could've done it more gently. However, the main issue is whether the friend's actions are wrong, and the author is just pointing that out. So the answer is probably B.\n"
