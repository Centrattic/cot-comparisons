He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who posted this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a friend who broke up with his girlfriend after being in a relationship for 8 months. The friend is acting out, calling her, threatening self-harm, and wanting to confront her. The poster, frustrated, told their friend he's being creepy and pathetic and needs to stop, leading to the friend kicking them out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend's behavior is clearly problematic. He's not respecting the breakup, engaging in behaviors that could be considered harassment (constant calling, threats to visit), and even has a history of threatening self-harm. The poster is trying to intervene, which is a friend trying to help. But did they handle it in the right way?\n\nThe key points here are intent and proportionality. The poster's intention was to help their friend by stopping harmful behavior. However, they used direct and harsh language (\"creepy and pathetic\"), which might have been hurtful. While the message might be valid, the delivery could have been more constructive. The friends agree that the behavior needs to stop, but thought the approach could have been nicer. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The line between being honest and being rude can be thin. Even if the words were harsh, if the intent was to help and prevent further harm (to the ex or the friend himself), it might be justified. The alternative is staying silent, which could allow the friend to continue in a harmful cycle. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend's mental health is a factor. The poster might have triggered someone already in a vulnerable state. However, the friend's actions (threatening self-harm, stalking behavior) are serious and need to be addressed. \n\nSo, the author's actions were a form of tough love. While the method could have been improved, the core message is correct. They're not in the wrong for trying to help. The answer is likely B (No).\n"
