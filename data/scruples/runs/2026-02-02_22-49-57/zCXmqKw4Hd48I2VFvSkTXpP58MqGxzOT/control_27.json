He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for confronting their friend about his behavior after a breakup. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe friend was in an eight-month relationship and became overly possessive, talking about marriage early on. The girlfriend broke up because he was moving too fast and needed to work on himself, specifically his anxiety. After the breakup, the friend had a mental health crisis, leading to a hospital visit. Now, he's constantly contacting her, threatening self-harm, and considering showing up at her place. The author, frustrated, told him he was being creepy and pathetic, leading to a fight and being kicked out. Friends agree with the author's message but think the approach could have been nicer.\n\nSo, the key points here are the friend's stalking and harassment behavior post-breakup. The author is trying to stop him from doing something dangerous or illegal. The friend's actions are clearly problematic\u2014stalking, threatening self-harm, and harassment. The author's intervention, while maybe not the most tactful, is aimed at preventing further harm. The friends agree with the message, which suggests that the author's intent was good. However, the author could have approached it more compassionately, maybe with support rather than direct criticism, to avoid making the friend defensive. But considering the potential consequences of the friend's actions, the author's warning was necessary. The main issue here is preventing harm, so the author isn't in the wrong for speaking up, even if the delivery could have been better. The answer should be B (No).\n"
