He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again. The friend was in a relationship for eight months, got dumped because he was moving too fast and has anxiety. After the breakup, he's acting out\u2014threatening self-harm, calling the ex constantly, and planning to go to her place. The author, along with friends, took turns helping him after the hospital. When it was the author's turn, they snapped after hearing about getting the ex back for the fifth time and told him he's being creepy and pathetic. The friend got angry and kicked them out. The friends agree with the author but think maybe the delivery could have been nicer.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author is at fault. Let's break it down. The friend's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014he's stalking, threatening self-harm, and not respecting the ex's wishes. The author is trying to stop this harmful behavior. The author's message was direct and harsh (\"creepy and pathetic\"), but maybe the intent was to help. However, the friend was already in a fragile state, having been hospitalized. The author's approach might have been confrontational, which could have caused him to feel attacked instead of supported. The friends think the message was right but could have been delivered nicer. \n\nOn one hand, the author is correct in pointing out the friend's inappropriate behavior. On the other hand, the way it was said might have exacerbated the friend's emotional state. The key here is whether the author's words were necessary and appropriate given the context. Even if the message was true, the delivery could have been more compassionate. However, the author's intention was to help prevent further harm. The friend's actions are clearly wrong, so the author isn't wrong for trying to intervene. The main issue is the method, but since the friends agree with the message, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
