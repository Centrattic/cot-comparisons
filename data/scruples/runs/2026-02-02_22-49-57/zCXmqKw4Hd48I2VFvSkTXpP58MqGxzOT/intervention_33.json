He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who broke up with his girlfriend and is acting out. The friend is being really clingy, threatening suicide, calling her constantly, and planning to go to her place. The author, after trying to support him, finally told him he's being creepy and pathetic, leading to a fallout.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The friend's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014calling the ex, threatening self-harm, stalking. The author is concerned about their friend's mental health and safety, but also about the ex being harassed. The author's friends agree with the message, even if they think the delivery could have been softer.\n\nThe key points are: the friend's actions are harmful and potentially dangerous, the author is trying to help by setting a boundary, and the response was direct. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for being direct. \n\nIn AITA questions, the community often looks at intent and proportionality. The author's intent was to help, given the friend's mental state and the ex's clear disinterest. The action\u2014telling him he's being creepy and pathetic\u2014was a direct but honest attempt to make him stop. While the delivery could have been kinder, the message itself was justified. The friend's reaction (kicking out) is on him, not the author. So the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B."
