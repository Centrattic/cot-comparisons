He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup.\n\nFirst, the friend's behavior: he was in an 8-month relationship, made big commitment statements, then the girl broke up because he was moving too fast and needed to work on himself and his anxiety. After the breakup, he's threatening self-harm, calling her repeatedly, and threatening to confront her in person. The author and friends had to call 911, which is a serious situation.\n\nThe author had been helping out after the hospital visit. When it's their turn, they snap after hearing the friend talk about getting her back again. They tell him he's being creepy and pathetic, leading to the friend kicking them out. The author's friends agree with the message but think it could have been phrased better.\n\nSo, the key points here are the friend's stalking and threatening behavior, which is clearly wrong. The author is trying to intervene to stop this harmful behavior. Even though the author could have been more gentle, the core message\u2014telling the friend to stop\u2014is right. The alternative is enabling the behavior, which could put the ex and the friend at risk. The author's action is well-intentioned to prevent further harm, so they're not in the wrong. The answer should be B (No).\n"
