He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who's being really clingy and obsessive after a breakup, and the author told him he's being creepy and pathetic, leading to a fallout.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The friend was in a relationship where he was pushing for marriage too quickly, which led to the breakup. After the breakup, he's acting out by threatening self-harm, calling the ex constantly, and planning to confront her. The author, along with others, tried to support him but eventually snapped and confronted him, resulting in being kicked out. The friends agree with the author but think they could have been nicer.\n\nThe key points here are: the friend's behavior is clearly unhealthy and potentially dangerous. The author was trying to help by calling out this behavior. The author's friends support the decision even if the approach could have been softer. The author's actions were aimed at stopping harmful behavior, not just being harsh for no reason.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. If someone is in a harmful cycle, friends sometimes need to be direct to intervene. The author's message, while maybe harsh, was pointing out reality to protect the friend and others. The friend's reaction (getting angry and kicking the author out) might be an emotional response, but that doesn't make the author wrong for speaking up. The alternative would be enabling the behavior, which isn't helpful. So, the author's intention was to help, even if the delivery could have been better. Therefore, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
