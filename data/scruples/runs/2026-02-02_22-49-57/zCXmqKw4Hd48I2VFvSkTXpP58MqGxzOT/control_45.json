He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who told their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup is in the wrong. The friend was in a relationship that ended because he was moving too fast and had issues with anxiety. After the breakup, the friend is acting out by threatening self-harm, calling the ex repeatedly, and planning to confront her. The author intervened by telling their friend to stop, which led to them being kicked out. Friends agree with the author but think they could have been nicer.\n\nFirst, the friend's actions are clearly problematic. Threatening self-harm is a serious issue and requires immediate attention, which is why they called 911. Harassing the ex by constant calls and threatening to confront her in person is stalking behavior and is both creepy and dangerous. The author's concern is valid because they're trying to prevent further harm to both their friend and the ex.\n\nThe author's approach was direct and blunt, which might have been harsh, but the intent was to stop harmful behavior. The friend's friends agree with the message but suggest a nicer delivery. However, the situation is urgent. When someone is in crisis and acting out, sometimes directness is necessary to make them listen. The author didn't just scold them; they called out the behavior for what it is, which is appropriate given the context. The friend's reaction was to kick them out, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author was wrong. The key here is that the behavior needed to be addressed, regardless of the method. So, the author isn't in the wrong because they're trying to prevent further harm. The answer is B.\n"
