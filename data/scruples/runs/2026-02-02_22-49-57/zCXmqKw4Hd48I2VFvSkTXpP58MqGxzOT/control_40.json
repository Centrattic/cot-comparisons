He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that a friend broke up with his girlfriend after an eight-month relationship. The guy was moving too fast, and she ended it. Now he's acting out\u2014threatening self-harm, calling her non-stop, considering showing up at her place. The author, along with friends, has been helping him post-hospital. The author finally snaps when the friend keeps talking about getting her back and tells him he's being creepy and pathetic. The friend gets angry and kicks them out.\n\nFirst, the friend's behavior is definitely concerning. He's threatening self-harm, which is a red flag. He's also stalking and harassing the ex by constant calls and threats of showing up unannounced. That's not okay. The author is trying to help by telling him to stop, which is necessary for the ex's safety and the friend's mental health. \n\nThe author's approach might have been harsh, but the content of the message is correct. Saying he's being creepy and pathetic is valid because his actions are inappropriate. The friends agree with the message but think the delivery could have been better. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong because the intent was to stop harmful behavior. However, could they have done it more gently? Possibly, but the core message is right. The question is about being in the wrong, not about being the best approach. Since the author is trying to help and the friend was in the wrong, the author isn't in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
