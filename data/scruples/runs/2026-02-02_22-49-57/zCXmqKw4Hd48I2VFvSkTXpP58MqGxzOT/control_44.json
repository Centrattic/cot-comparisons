He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is wrong for confronting their friend about his behavior after a breakup.\n\nFirst, the friend was in a relationship where he pushed too fast, leading to the breakup. Afterward, he's acting out by threatening self-harm, calling the ex constantly, and considering showing up uninvited. The author steps in, tells their friend he's being creepy and pathetic, and the friend responds by kicking them out. The friends agree with the author's sentiment but think a nicer approach could have been used.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author was wrong to confront their friend. The author's actions were meant to stop harmful behavior. The friend's actions are clearly problematic\u2014stalking, harassment, and self-harm threats. The author's intervention, while harsh, seems necessary to stop this. The friends support the message even if the delivery could be smoother. The author's intent was to help, so they're not in the wrong. The friend's behavior is the real problem here.\n"
