He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for confronting their friend after a breakup. The friend was moving too fast in the relationship, leading to the breakup. Now, post-breakup, he's acting out by threatening self-harm, constantly calling the ex, and even considering showing up uninvited. The author tells him he's being creepy and pathetic, which leads to the friend kicking them out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The friend's behavior\u2014threatening self-harm, incessant calls, and potential stalking\u2014is definitely concerning. The author is trying to help by telling them to stop, but the friend is upset. The question is whether the author overstepped.\n\nThe author's friends agree with the sentiment but think the approach could have been nicer. So maybe the message was correct but the delivery was harsh. However, given the severity of the friend's actions (self-harm threats), the author might have a valid concern about their friend's well-being and safety, as well as the ex's. \n\nBut is it their place to tell someone they're being creepy? The friend was in a vulnerable state, so confronting them in a moment of anger (as the author mentions they \"lost it\") might not be the best approach. However, the content of the message\u2014telling the friend to stop contacting the ex\u2014seems necessary to prevent further harm. The author probably had good intentions, but the way they said it might have been unkind. \n\nStill, the friend's actions are clearly problematic. The author isn't just being judgmental; they're addressing real harmful behavior. The friend kicking them out is a reaction to the criticism, not necessarily a sign that the author was wrong. The friend might not be ready to hear it, but that doesn't mean the author is at fault. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the key is whether the person acted unreasonably. Here, the author is trying to intervene in a dangerous situation. While the delivery could have been softer, the substance is about stopping a friend from acting in a way that's unhealthy and potentially illegal (harassment). So the author is likely in the right, but maybe could have handled it better. But the question is if they are in the wrong. The answer seems to be B, No.\n"
