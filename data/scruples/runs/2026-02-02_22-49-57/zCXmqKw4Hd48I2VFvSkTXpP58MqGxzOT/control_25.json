He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who told their friend he was being creepy and pathetic after a breakup is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who was in a relationship for eight months, then broke up. The friend is acting out\u2014calling 911 because he was threatening self-harm, constantly contacting the ex, and planning to confront her. The author confronts their friend, saying he's being creepy and pathetic, leading to being kicked out. Friends agree with the author but think they could have been nicer.\n\nFirst, the friend's behavior is clearly problematic. He's not respecting the ex's boundaries, threatening self-harm, and stalking. The author is trying to help by pointing this out. The key issue is whether the author's approach was wrong. The friend's actions are harmful and need to stop, so the advice is valid. However, the author's tone was harsh (\"creepy and pathetic\"), which might have been unhelpful. But the intent was to help, and friends agree with the message. So while the delivery could have been softer, the content is right. The author isn't in the wrong because they're trying to prevent further harm. The answer should be B (No).\n"
