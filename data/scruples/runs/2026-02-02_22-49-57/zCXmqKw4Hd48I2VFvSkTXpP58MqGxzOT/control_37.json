He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend was in an 8-month relationship where he pushed for commitment too fast, leading to the breakup. Post-breakup, he's acting out\u2014threatening self-harm, constantly contacting the ex, and even considering showing up at her place. The author, after trying to support him, finally snaps and calls him out, which leads to the friend getting angry and kicking them out. The friends agree with the author but think they could have been nicer.\n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. The key points are: the friend's behavior is unhealthy and potentially dangerous (harassment, threats), the author is trying to intervene for his well-being and the ex's safety. The author's message, while harsh, is pointing out the reality of the situation. The friend's actions are the main issue here. The author's intent was to help, even if the delivery was blunt. The friends support the author, suggesting their approach wasn't wrong, just the tone. So, the answer is likely B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. But I need to check if there's any aspect where the author overstepped. Maybe if the friend was in a vulnerable state, but the author had tried supporting him first. The threat of self-harm and harassment makes the author's intervention reasonable, albeit harsh. So, the answer is B.\n"
