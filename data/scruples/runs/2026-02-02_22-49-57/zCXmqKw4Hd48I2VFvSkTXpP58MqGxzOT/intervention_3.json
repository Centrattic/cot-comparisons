He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend was in an 8-month relationship where he was overly committed, talking about marriage. The girl broke up with him because he was moving too fast and had anxiety issues. After the breakup, the friend had a breakdown, leading to a hospital visit due to self-harm threats. He kept contacting the ex, threatening to confront her in person. The author, frustrated, told him he was being creepy and pathetic, which led to the friend kicking them out. The friends agree with the author but think the approach could have been nicer.\n\nSo, the key points here: the ex is being stalked or harassed post-breakup. The author is trying to stop their friend from doing something harmful. The friend's behavior is clearly inappropriate\u2014calling her repeatedly, threatening self-harm, wanting to approach her. The author's response was direct, but maybe not the most tactful.\n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong. From a moral standpoint, telling a friend to stop harassing an ex is right. However, the friend was already in a fragile mental state. The author's approach was harsh, but the intent was to help. The alternatives might include a more supportive conversation, but the author's message was necessary. The friend's reaction (kicking them out) shows he was defensive, but that doesn't make the author wrong. The ex's clear disinterest means the friend needed to stop, and the author was trying to prevent further harm. So, the author isn't in the wrong. They might have been better to approach it more gently, but the core message was correct. So answer B.\n"
