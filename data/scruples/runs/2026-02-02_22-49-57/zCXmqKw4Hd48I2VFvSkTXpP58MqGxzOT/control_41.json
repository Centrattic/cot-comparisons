He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who's acting creepy after a breakup, and the author told him off.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The friend was with a girl for eight months, making big claims about marriage. The girl broke up because he was moving too fast and had anxiety. After the breakup, he's threatening suicide, calling her non-stop, and planning to visit her. The author intervened, told him he's being creepy and pathetic, and the friend got angry.\n\nNow, the main question is if the author did the right thing. The friend's behavior is definitely concerning\u2014calling 911 because of self-harm threats, stalking-like behavior. The author's friends agree with them, though they thought a nicer way could have been used.\n\nSo, the author is trying to help. They had to be direct because the friend was in a bad state and not listening. Even though the approach might have been harsh, the intent was good. The alternative would be ignoring the problem, which is worse. The friend's actions are wrong, so pointing that out isn't the author's fault.\n\nPossible counterpoints: Maybe the author should have been more gentle. But given the urgency and the friend's unstable state, being direct might have been necessary. The friends support the author, which suggests it was justified.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the focus is on both intent and impact. The author's intent was to help, and the impact was the friend getting angry. However, the friend's actions were problematic. The author isn't in the wrong for addressing harmful behavior, even if the delivery could have been softer.\n\nSo, answer B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
