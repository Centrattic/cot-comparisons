He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a friend who, after a breakup, is acting in a way that seems obsessive and potentially threatening. The author confronted their friend about being creepy and pathetic, leading to an argument and being kicked out. The friends agree with the author but think they could have been nicer.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The friend was in a relationship that ended because he moved too fast and had anxiety. After the breakup, he's threatening self-harm, constantly contacting the ex, and even considering showing up uninvited. The author called out his behavior, which is appropriate because stalking or harassment is wrong. However, the method of confrontation might have been harsh. The friend was already in a fragile state, so the tone and approach matter. The author's friends agree with the message but suggest a nicer way, implying the delivery could be the issue, not the content. The author isn't in the wrong for pointing out the behavior, but maybe the way they did it. So the answer is B, No. The author isn't in the wrong for confronting the behavior, even if they could have been more tactful.\n"
