He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who's acting really badly after a breakup. The friend was with this girl for eight months and was super intense about being \"the one.\" Then she broke up with him because he was moving too fast. The friend then had a mental breakdown, called 911, and was hospitalized. Now he's constantly contacting the ex, threatening to visit her, and the author told him he was being creepy and pathetic. The friend kicked them out, and the author's friends agree with them but said maybe the author could have been nicer.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault. Let me break it down. The friend is clearly acting unhealthily\u2014stalking behavior, threats of self-harm, not respecting the ex's boundaries. The author is trying to help by confronting their friend about these issues. Even though the author could have approached it more gently, the content of what they said is valid. The ex has made it clear she wants nothing to do with him, so the friend's actions are indeed creepy and dangerous. The author's intention was to stop their friend from doing something harmful. The friend's reaction (getting angry and kicking them out) is their own problem. The key here is that the author was trying to intervene in a destructive situation, not out of malice. The friends also agree that the author was correct in their stance. So, the author isn't wrong for pointing out the issue, even if the delivery could have been better. Therefore, the answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
