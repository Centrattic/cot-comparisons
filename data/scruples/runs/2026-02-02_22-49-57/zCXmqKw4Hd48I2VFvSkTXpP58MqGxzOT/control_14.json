He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup.\n\nFirst, the friend was in an 8-month relationship with a girl. The friend was moving too fast and had anxiety issues, which led to the breakup. After the breakup, he's acting out by threatening self-harm, constantly calling the ex, and possibly showing up at her place. The writer, frustrated, told their friend he was being creepy and pathetic, leading to the friend kicking them out. The friends agree with the writer's message but think it could have been said nicer.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the writer's actions were justified. The friend's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014threatening self-harm, stalking-like behavior (following her to the city), and being a constant burden. The writer's intent was to intervene and help their friend, even if the delivery was harsh. The friend's response was to kick them out, but that might be a result of his own emotional state. The writer's friends support the message, just not the tone. \n\nIn such situations, people often need to be told the truth, even if it's harsh. The friend's actions are harmful, both to himself (self-harm) and potentially to the ex (harassment). The writer's intervention seems to be in good faith, trying to prevent further harm. While the method could have been improved, the message itself is valid. So, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong, which is option B.\n"
