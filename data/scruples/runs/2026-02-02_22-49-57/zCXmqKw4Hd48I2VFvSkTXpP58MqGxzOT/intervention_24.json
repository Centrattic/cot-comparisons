He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who's acting out after a breakup. The writer told their friend he was being creepy and pathetic, leading to a fallout.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The friend was in a relationship where he was pushing for marriage, which the girl didn't want. After the breakup, he's threatening self-harm, calling her non-stop, and even considering confronting her. The writer intervened by telling him to stop, which made their friend angry and kicked them out. The friends agree with the writer but think a nicer approach might have been better.\n\nThe question is whether the author is at fault. The user thinks the author isn't, but wants my opinion. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the friend's behavior is definitely problematic. Harassment after a breakup is usually considered abusive. The writer is trying to help by setting boundaries. However, the way they delivered the message\u2014calling the friend creepy and pathetic\u2014might have been harsh. While the message was necessary, the tone could have been more supportive. The friends' agreement suggests that the content was right, but the delivery could have been smoother. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for the message but might have handled it better. But the question is about being \"in the wrong\" generally. Since the core issue is the friend's behavior, the author's intervention was justified. Therefore, the answer is B (No). But I need to make sure there's no nuance I'm missing. Maybe the author could have been more empathetic initially, but the outcome was necessary. The main problem was the friend's actions, not the author's response. So, B is correct.\n"
