He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. The friend was really acting out\u2014calling the ex, threatening suicide, wanting to confront her. The author told him to stop, and the friend kicked them out. The friends agree with the author but said maybe a nicer approach.\n\nFirst, the friend's behavior is definitely concerning. He's not handling the breakup well, has mental health issues, and is acting out. The author tried to intervene when the friend was in a bad place. But the way they did it might be the issue. Telling someone they're \"creepy and pathetic\" might not be the best approach, even if the intent is good. The author's friends say they agree but maybe a nicer way would help. So maybe the author isn't entirely wrong, but the delivery was harsh. However, the main issue is the friend's actions, not the author's response. Since the author was trying to help a friend in crisis, even if the words were strong, they might not be in the wrong. So answer B.\n"
