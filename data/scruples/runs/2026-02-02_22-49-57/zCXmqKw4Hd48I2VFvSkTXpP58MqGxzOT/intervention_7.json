He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend who's acting in a concerning way after a breakup, and the author told him he was being creepy and pathetic.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The friend, who's 22, was in an 8-month relationship where he was very committed, talking about marriage. The breakup was because he was moving too fast and dealing with anxiety. After the split, he's threatening self-harm, calling the ex constantly, and even considering showing up at her place. The author, along with friends, tried to support him, but when the friend kept talking about getting her back, the author snapped and told him he's creepy and pathetic. The friend got angry and kicked them out. Friends agree with the author but think they could have been nicer.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author was in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nThe author's actions: confronting a friend who's in crisis but acting in a way that's potentially harmful. The author is trying to help the friend and the ex by stopping his stalking-like behavior. The friend's actions are not just about moving on but are dangerous\u2014threats of self-harm, harassment, and possible stalking. The author's message is to stop this behavior because the ex has clearly said no.\n\nIs the author wrong for calling the friend creepy and pathetic? Well, the friend's actions are indeed problematic. The author is trying to intervene in a situation that could escalate. Even though the delivery might not have been perfect, the intent was to help. The friend's response (getting angry and kicking out) shows he's defensive, which is common in such situations. The friends also agree that the substance of what the author said is correct, even if the approach could be improved.\n\nBut maybe the author could have approached it differently. However, the question is about being in the wrong. The friend's actions are the real issue here. The author is trying to stop something harmful, not being cruel for no reason. So the author isn't in the wrong. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
