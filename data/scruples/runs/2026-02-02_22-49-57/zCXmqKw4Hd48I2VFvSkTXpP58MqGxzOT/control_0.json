He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling a friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. The friend was moving too fast in the relationship and the girl broke up with him. After the breakup, he's threatening self-harm, calling her repeatedly, and even considering showing up at her place. The author, frustrated, finally confronts him and tells him to stop, calling him creepy and pathetic. The friend kicked them out, but others agree with the author's stance but think they could have been nicer.\n\nHmm, first I need to assess if the author did something wrong. The friend's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014threatening self-harm, stalking, harassment. The author tried to help by calling out the behavior. The question is whether the author was wrong to do so. The key points here are the friend's actions post-breakup, which are concerning and potentially dangerous. The author's method of confronting them was direct and maybe a bit harsh, but the intent was to stop the harmful behavior. \n\nThe friend's actions\u2014like threatening self-harm and possibly showing up at the ex's place\u2014could be a sign of a mental health crisis. The author did step in after the hospital visit, which suggests they were trying to support their friend. However, the friend might have felt shamed or blamed, leading to the argument. The friends agree with the author's message but think the delivery could have been better. So the author's words were direct, but the intent was good. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author isn't in the wrong for trying to help. The issue is that they could have phrased it more supportively, but the core message was valid. The friend's behavior is inappropriate, and the author was attempting to intervene. So the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're addressing harmful actions, even if the approach could have been softer.\n"
