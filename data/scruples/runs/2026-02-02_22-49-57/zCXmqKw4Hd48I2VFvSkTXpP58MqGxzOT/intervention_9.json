He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup. The friend was acting out, threatening self-harm, and harassing the ex-girlfriend. The author's friends agree with them but think they could have been nicer.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend was in a bad state after the breakup, which led to a hospital visit. The author tried to intervene because the friend was persistently trying to get back with the ex in a way that's unhealthy. The key points here are the friend's behavior\u2014calling, threatening, wanting to show up uninvited. That's definitely not okay. The author was trying to stop that, which is a good intention.\n\nNow, the author's approach was direct and maybe harsh. They told the friend he was creepy and pathetic. Even though the friend got upset and kicked them out, the message was necessary. The author's friends agree that the friend needed to stop, so there's support for the author's stance. However, sometimes how you deliver a message matters. Maybe the author could have been more empathetic while still making the same point, but that's not being in the wrong necessarily.\n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong for the content of their message. Since the friend's actions were unhealthy and the author was trying to help, the content itself is justified. The method might be debatable, but the content isn't. So the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
