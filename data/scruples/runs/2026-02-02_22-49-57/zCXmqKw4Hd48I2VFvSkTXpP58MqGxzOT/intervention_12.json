He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who's acting in a concerning way after a breakup, and the author told him he's being creepy and pathetic. The friend then kicked the author out of his apartment.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The friend was in an eight-month relationship, made grand claims about marriage, then got dumped because he was moving too fast and had anxiety issues. After the breakup, he's threatening suicide, calling the ex, threatening her, and wanting to confront her in person. The author intervenes by telling him he's being creepy and that the ex doesn't want to get back together. The friend gets angry and kicks the author out. Friends agree with the author's message but think he could have been nicer.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't, but wants a confirmation. \n\nIn similar cases, when someone is acting in a stalkerish or obsessive manner, friends often step in. The author's message is about safety: the ex is clear she doesn't want to reconcile, so continuing to pursue her is unhealthy and potentially dangerous. The author's words might have been harsh (\"creepy and pathetic\"), but the intent is to protect the friend and the ex. Friends agree with the message, indicating it's a valid concern.\n\nHowever, the delivery could be a point of contention. The author \"lost it\" after multiple instances, which might have been unhelpful if said in anger. But given the context of the friend's destructive behavior, the core message is justified. The author isn't violating any norms; they're trying to help a friend who's in crisis. The friend's reaction (kicking them out) is a consequence of the message, but that doesn't make the author wrong. \n\nThe key factors here are the friend's safety and the ex's well-being. The author is addressing a real problem, even if the tone could have been softer. In AITA scenarios, intent and impact matter. The intent was to help, and the impact was to make the friend stop the harmful behavior. So the answer is likely B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
