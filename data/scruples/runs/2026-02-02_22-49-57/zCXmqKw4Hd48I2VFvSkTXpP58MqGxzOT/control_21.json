He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is at fault for telling their friend he's being creepy and pathetic after a breakup.\n\nFirst, the friend was in a relationship for eight months and was moving too fast, leading to the breakup. He's struggling with anxiety and has been acting out\u2014calling the ex, threatening self-harm, and planning to confront her. The writer, after several attempts to reach out, tells their friend he's being creepy and needs to stop. The friend gets angry and kicks them out. The friends agree with the writer's message but think the approach could have been nicer.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the ex's behavior is concerning (self-harm, harassment), the writer is trying to intervene for his well-being and the ex's safety. The writer's message, while harsh, is intended to help. But the delivery might be an issue. However, the content of what was said\u2014that he's being creepy and needs to stop\u2014is valid. The question is whether the writer is in the wrong for delivering that message, regardless of the tone.\n\nThe writer's actions were to prevent further harmful behavior, which is understandable. The friend's actions are problematic, so pointing out the creepiness is justified. The main issue might be the harshness of the words, but the intent was positive. So, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The friend's behavior is the real problem here, and the writer was trying to help.\n"
