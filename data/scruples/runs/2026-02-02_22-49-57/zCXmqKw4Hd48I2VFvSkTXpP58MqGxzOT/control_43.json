He is 22.\n\nWhile he was with her, he would go on and on about how she was \"the one\" and how they were going to get married, etc. \n\nShe recently broke up with him because he was moving way too fast in the relationship and he needs time to work on himself and deal with his anxiety.\n\nHe completely lost it after this. We ended up having to call 911 and have him taken to the hospital because he was calling her and us threatening harm on himself. \n\nHe constantly calls her asking why she can't take him back, and he told us that if she's in the city, he might go to her place and \"ask her in person\". \n\nWell, me and my friends all took turns spending time with him after the hospital visit and on my turn I just lost it after hearing for the fifth time how he was going to \"get her back.\"\n\nI told him he was being creepy and pathetic and that she has made it abundantly clear that she doesn't want to get back together with him and he needs to stop all this behavior. \n\nHe got really pissed and kicked me out of his apartment.\n\nMy friends told me that I probably could have done it in a nicer way but that they agree with me.\n\nSo AITA for telling him all that?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who's been acting creepy after a breakup, and the author told him off. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The friend was moving too fast in the relationship, which led to the breakup. After the breakup, he's threatening self-harm, calling the ex constantly, and even considering showing up at her place. The author told him he's being creepy and pathetic, which caused them to get kicked out.\n\nSo, the main question is whether the author's intervention is justified. The author's actions were meant to help, but the friend reacted negatively. The friends agree with the author but think it could have been phrased better.\n\nI should consider if the author overstepped. The friend's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014stalking, threatening self-harm, harassment. The author's message was direct, but the friend was in crisis. Maybe there's a better way to approach someone in emotional distress, like using empathy first. However, the author's intent was to stop harmful behavior. The friend's actions are dangerous, so the author had a reason to step in. The friends agree, so the author isn't alone in thinking this. The problem is the method. Telling someone they're \"pathetic\" might not be the best approach, but the intent was to help. \n\nSo, the answer is probably B (No, the author isn't in the wrong) because they were trying to prevent further harmful actions, even if the delivery could have been better. The line between being right and the method used can be thin, but the core issue is the friend's dangerous behavior, not the author's intervention.\n"
