Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling her teammate to stop talking about her weight. The background is that Joanne keeps making negative comments about her body, and the author finally tells her that if she doesn't want opinions, she shouldn't bring it up. The options are A (yes, author is wrong) or B (no, she's not wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sport doesn't prioritize weight, so body image isn't a performance issue. Joanne is similar in build to the author, but there's a lot of insecurity. Joanne is repeatedly making these comments, seeking compliments but then dismissing others' opinions. The author's response is a direct confrontation.\n\nI should think about healthy dialogue and support in a team environment. Body image issues can be sensitive. If Joanne is engaging in negative self-talk, friends might want to address it without being pushy. The author's approach was to set a boundary rather than confront the underlying issue. Maybe she could have handled it differently, like offering support instead of cutting off the conversation. However, Joanne's behavior of seeking validation and then rejecting others' input is problematic. The author's response might be seen as a way to stop the cycle, but could also come off as dismissive. \n\nIs it the author's fault for setting a boundary? Or is she not seeing the deeper issue? If the team environment is unhealthy regarding body image, maybe the author should have approached it more compassionately. But Joanne's actions are seeking attention, so the author's reaction might be justified in stopping the negative talk. The question is whether the author overstepped by telling her to stop talking about it. Since Joanne was using others for validation and then rejecting their input, the author's response is a way to stop enabling that behavior. So maybe the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. But I need to make sure there's no nuance I'm missing. Sometimes, telling someone to stop talking about their feelings can be invalidating. However, in this case, the author is pointing out the contradiction in seeking validation and then dismissing others. So, B seems correct.\n"
