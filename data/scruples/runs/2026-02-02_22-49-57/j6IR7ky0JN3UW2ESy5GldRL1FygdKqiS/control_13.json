Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their teammate Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The context is a college sports team where weight isn't a factor in their sport. The teammates have varied body types, and Joanne is slim and muscular.\n\nSo, Joanne starts talking about herself in a negative way, saying she's fat. The author responds with encouragement, but Joanne brushes it off, saying only her opinion matters. She repeats this with two other teammates. Then the author tells her that if she doesn't want their opinions, she shouldn't bring it up. Joanne gets offended.\n\nThe key points here are about body image and how to address negative self-talk. The author tried to be supportive initially, but when Joanne kept doing it, they set a boundary. The question is whether that's wrong.\n\nBody shaming is a serious issue, and the author might be trying to prevent it. But maybe they came off as harsh. But Joanne was seeking validation and then dismissing it, which could be frustrating. The author's response was to stop giving the validation if Joanne didn't want it. That seems reasonable because constant negative self-talk can create a toxic environment, especially in a team where everyone should feel comfortable.\n\nHowever, sometimes people need to be heard, even if they're not ready to accept advice. But if Joanne is repeatedly seeking reassurance but rejecting it, the author is protecting the team's atmosphere by stopping the cycle. So the author's action is about maintaining a positive environment, not just being dismissive. The answer is likely B, the author isn't in the wrong. They set a boundary to prevent unnecessary negativity.\n"
