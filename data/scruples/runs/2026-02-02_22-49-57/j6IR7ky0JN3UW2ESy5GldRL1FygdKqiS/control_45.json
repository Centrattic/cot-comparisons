Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The context is a college sports team where weight isn't a factor in performance. Joanne, a teammate, is similar in build to the author and has body image issues. The author steps in after Joanne makes negative comments about her body and then dismisses others' compliments.\n\nFirst, Joanne is repeatedly bringing up her weight and then invalidating others' positive feedback. This behavior can create a negative environment, especially in a group setting. The author's response is to tell Joanne to stop talking about it if she doesn't want their opinions. The key points here are about respecting boundaries and the impact of such comments.\n\nIn a team environment, it's important to foster a positive atmosphere. If someone is consistently self-deprecating and then dismissing others' attempts to uplift them, it might not just affect them but also create discomfort in the group. The author is trying to set a boundary to prevent the conversation from continuing in a cycle of negativity. \n\nHowever, the author could have approached it differently, maybe by expressing concern or offering support rather than cutting off the conversation entirely. But the intent here seems to be about stopping the pattern of behavior that's causing issues. The author isn't attacking Joanne's feelings directly but is addressing the repetitive and invalidating nature of her comments. \n\nThe other teammates are also affected since Joanne targets multiple people. The author's intervention might be a way to protect both themselves and others from the cycle of negative self-talk followed by dismissing support. \n\nIt's a delicate balance between respecting someone's right to express their feelings and maintaining a positive group dynamic. The author's approach might be seen as a necessary boundary, especially if Joanne's behavior is affecting the team's atmosphere. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for setting that boundary, even if the method could be improved. The main issue is the repetition and invalidation, which the author is trying to address.\n"
