Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The situation is in a college sports team where weight isn't important. Joanne frequently makes negative comments about her body and then dismisses others' compliments. The author gets fed up and tells her to stop if she doesn't want their opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sport isn't weight-dependent, so body image issues might be unnecessary stress. The team has diverse body types, which suggests that there's no \"right\" size. Joanne's behavior seems to be seeking validation but then rejecting it, which could be frustrating for others.\n\nThe author's response was to set a boundary by saying if Joanne doesn't want their opinions, she shouldn't bring it up. That sounds like a reasonable way to handle someone who's seeking validation but then invalidating others' input. The key here is whether the author overstepped or if they were justified in setting a boundary.\n\nPossible angles: Is the author being supportive by trying to stop negative talk? Or are they dismissing Joanne's feelings? But Joanne's pattern of behavior is repetitive and dismissive. The author's response is about setting limits, which is healthy in a team environment. So, the author isn't wrong for wanting to stop the cycle of negative self-talk and the subsequent dismissal of others' support.\n\nAnother point: The author didn't attack Joanne but pointed out the inconsistency in her behavior. That's a fair approach. Joanne's reaction being offended might indicate she needs to hear it, but that doesn't make the author wrong. The answer should be B: No, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
