Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the context: they're on a college sports team where weight isn't a factor. The team has various body types, which suggests that there's no pressure related to weight for performance. The author's teammate, Joanne, has a similar body type and seems to have insecurities. Joanne starts by commenting on her own weight, saying she's fat. The author responds with a compliment. Then Joanne repeats this with two other teammates, each time getting a compliment but then dismissing it by saying it's only her opinion. Finally, the author tells Joanne that if she doesn't want feedback, she shouldn't bring it up. Joanne reacts with offense.\n\nThe key points here are about body image and how to handle friends' insecurities. The author is trying to stop the negative self-talk by drawing a line. The question is whether the author overstepped.\n\nIn terms of social dynamics, when someone repeatedly seeks validation and then dismisses it, it can be frustrating. The author might feel that by pointing out the issue, they're protecting their teammates from having to engage in a cycle of self-criticism. However, Joanne might feel that the author is being dismissive of her feelings, hence the offended reaction.\n\nI need to consider if the author had the right to speak up. Since Joanne was initiating the conversation each time, the author's response was in the context of Joanne's own self-criticism. The author isn't attacking Joanne but is setting a boundary. The situation is a group setting, so maybe the author is trying to prevent a toxic environment where others feel pressured to give compliments they're uncomfortable with.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author should have handled it more gently, perhaps by having a private conversation with Joanne. Publicly calling out the behavior might have been harsh. However, given that Joanne repeated the behavior multiple times, the author might have felt that a direct approach was necessary.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, I think the author is not in the wrong. They're trying to address a pattern of behavior that's causing discomfort, even if their approach could have been more tactful. The core issue is about respecting boundaries and not engaging in self-deprecation that others find uncomfortable. The author isn't making a judgment about Joanne's body but is asking her to stop seeking validation in a way that's draining for others.\n"
