Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling their teammate to stop talking about her weight. The background is that the sport doesn't focus on weight, and there's a variety of body types. The teammate, Joanne, is similar in physique and keeps complaining about her weight, then dismissing others' compliments. The author finally tells her not to talk about it if she doesn't want their opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sport isn't about weight, so there's no real health issue here. Joanne is probably dealing with insecurity, common among young people, especially women in sports where appearance can be a factor. The author's teammates are giving compliments but Joanne is rejecting them, which might be frustrating. The author's response was to set a boundary, which could be seen as standing up for themselves and others who were targeted.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? The key points are intent and impact. The author's intent was to stop the negative behavior, which is understandable. Joanne wasn't trying to harm, just express her insecurities, but that doesn't justify the author's response? Or does it? Also, the author might have contributed to a toxic environment by not addressing it earlier. However, the author is also protecting others from unnecessary negativity. \n\nAnother angle: body shaming is serious, but Joanne is shaming herself. The author's response might be seen as cutting off a conversation that's about self-esteem. However, Joanne's repeated behavior could be affecting the team's morale. The author's action could be supportive in the long run by reducing the spread of negative self-talk.\n\nIn terms of social dynamics, setting boundaries is important. The author isn't attacking Joanne's feelings directly but is addressing the pattern. The response might come off as abrupt, but it's a valid way to handle peer pressure and negative influence. The author isn't wrong; they took a stand to protect the team's positive environment.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
