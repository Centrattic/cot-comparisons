Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The scenario is in a college sports team where weight isn't important. Joanne keeps making negative comments about her body and then dismisses others' compliments. The author finally tells her not to talk about it if she doesn't want opinions.\n\nSo, the key points here. First, the team's sport doesn't care about weight, so there's no actual health or performance issue. The problem is Joanne's behavior. She's doing this to three teammates, each time getting a compliment and then invalidating it. The author steps in after the third time. \n\nI need to consider the dynamics. Joanne's comments could contribute to a negative body image environment, which isn't good for team morale. The author was trying to stop that. But was it the right approach? The author's response was a bit direct\u2014telling her not to talk about it. Maybe that could come off as dismissive or confrontational. However, Joanne was already invalidating others, so the author might feel justified in setting a boundary.\n\nPossible angles: Is the author overstepping by policing Joanne's comments? Or is it about creating a positive environment? Also, Joanne's behavior might be a sign of deeper issues, but the author's intention was to stop the cycle of negative self-talk. \n\nIn terms of being \"in the wrong,\" if the author's intention was to support teammates and prevent toxic behavior, then they might not be in the wrong. But if the approach was too harsh or not the right time/place, maybe. The response was a bit abrupt, but given the context, maybe necessary. \n\nAlso, considering that the team is a close-knit group where such comments can spread insecurity, the author's action could be seen as protecting the team's atmosphere. So, the answer leans towards B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). They were addressing a toxic behavior in a supportive environment.\n"
