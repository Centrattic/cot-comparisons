Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling their teammate, Joanne, to stop talking about her weight. The context is a college sports team where body image issues are common.\n\nFirst, Joanne keeps commenting on her own weight, saying she's fat, then dismissing others' opinions. The author tries to reassure her each time, but Joanne invalidates their input. After three instances, the author tells her not to talk about it if she doesn't want feedback. Joanne seems offended.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author is trying to help by giving compliments, but Joanne isn't accepting them and is making others feel like their opinions don't matter. The author then sets a boundary by asking her to stop bringing it up. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, they're addressing a behavior that's causing discomfort. If Joanne is seeking validation but then rejecting it, it's a cycle that can be hurtful. The author's response is setting a boundary, which is a reasonable action when someone's behavior is affecting others. \n\nJoanne might feel offended, but the author isn't attacking her directly; they're asking her to stop the behavior that's causing friction. In a team setting, mutual respect and support are important. The author is promoting a positive environment by encouraging Joanne to focus on her own perspective without constantly seeking others' reassurances or dismissing them.\n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. They're taking a stand to prevent unnecessary negativity in the group. The answer should be B.\n"
