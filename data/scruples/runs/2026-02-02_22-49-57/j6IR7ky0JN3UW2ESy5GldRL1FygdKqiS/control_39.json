Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author is wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The context is a college sports team where weight isn't a factor in performance. Joanne repeatedly comments on her own weight, seeking compliments but then dismissing others' opinions. The author finally tells her not to talk about it if she doesn't want feedback.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Joanne's behavior seems to be about seeking validation but then invalidating others when they give it. This can create a negative environment, especially in a team setting where body image issues might be common. The author's response is to set a boundary, which is understandable. They probably wanted to stop the cycle of insecurity and the unnecessary focus on weight.\n\nHowever, the author might have approached it differently. Instead of a direct \"if you don't want our opinions, don't talk about it,\" maybe a more compassionate approach could work. But the question is whether the author was in the wrong. Joanne initiated the conversation each time, so the author isn't the one starting the discussion. The author's comment was a reaction to repeated behavior that's affecting others. In that case, setting a boundary isn't necessarily wrong. The issue is about respecting others' boundaries and not forcing people to engage in topics they find uncomfortable. So the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
