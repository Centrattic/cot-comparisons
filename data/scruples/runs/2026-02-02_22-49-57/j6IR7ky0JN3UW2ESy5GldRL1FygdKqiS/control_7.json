Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author did something wrong by telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight.\n\nSo, the background is that they're on a college sports team where weight isn't important. The teammate Joanne keeps talking about how she's fat, even though others think she looks good. The author tried to compliment her, but Joanne dismissed it, saying only her own opinion matters. Then she does this with two more teammates. Finally, the author tells her to stop talking about it around them if she doesn't want their opinions. Joanne gets offended.\n\nHmm. The author's intention was probably to stop the negative self-talk that's affecting the team's environment. But Joanne's actions might be part of a larger issue with body image or insecurity. Maybe she's struggling with self-esteem, and the author's response was a bit abrupt. But on the other hand, the author might feel that Joanne is seeking validation and then dismissing it, which can be annoying or hurtful in the long run.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author tried to be supportive first (\"No you aren't! You look great\"). Then after Joanne repeated the behavior with others, the author set a boundary. Setting boundaries is generally healthy. However, maybe the author could have handled it more sensitively, like talking to Joanne privately instead of in front of others, to avoid making her defensive. But the act of setting a boundary isn't necessarily wrong. Joanne's behavior was repetitive and possibly harmful, so the author's response was about protecting the team's dynamic.\n\nSo, answer B (No) because the author isn't in the wrong for setting a boundary after Joanne's repeated negative self-talk. However, maybe they could have approached it differently, but the main issue is Joanne's behavior prompting the response.\n"
