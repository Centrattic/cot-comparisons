Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their teammate to stop talking about her weight. The situation is that Joanne keeps making negative comments about her body and the author finally tells her not to talk about it if she doesn't want their opinions. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is on a college sports team where body types vary, and there's already a lot of insecurity. The author's team has a range of body types, which suggests that body image might be a sensitive topic here. Joanne is making self-deprecating remarks, and the author is trying to counter them with compliments, but Joanne dismisses them. Then the author decides to set a boundary by telling her to stop talking about her weight if she doesn't want their opinions.\n\nThe key points here are about boundaries and respect. The author is responding to repeated negative comments that they find uncomfortable. It's common for people to feel pressured when someone seeks validation and then dismisses it. The author's response was to set a boundary, which can be a healthy approach because it stops the cycle of seeking compliments and then dismissing them. \n\nHowever, the question is whether the author overstepped. Some might argue that talking about body image is personal, and the author might have been too direct. But considering that Joanne kept bringing it up and the author was trying to protect their own mental health and the team's environment, setting that boundary seems reasonable. \n\nAlso, the fact that Joanne was doing this to multiple teammates shows that it's a recurring issue. The author's action could prevent others from feeling the same discomfort and might encourage a more positive atmosphere. \n\nI should also think about the intention. The author's intention was to stop the negative self-talk in their presence, which could help reduce the team's overall insecurity. It's not just about Joanne's feelings but also about creating a supportive environment. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because they were addressing a persistent issue that was affecting themselves and possibly others. Setting a boundary to stop the cycle of negative self-talk is a valid action here. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
