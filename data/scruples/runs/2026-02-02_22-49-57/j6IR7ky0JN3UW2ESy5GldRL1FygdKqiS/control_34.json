Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. They're on a college sports team where weight isn't an issue. The team has a variety of body types, so it's not about performance here. The main issue is Joanne's comments about her own weight and how she's doing it to multiple teammates, getting their opinions but then dismissing them. The author, after Joanne does this three times, tells her to stop talking about it if she doesn't want their opinions.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics. Joanne is making negative comments about herself, which can create a toxic environment. The author is trying to address the behavior by pointing out that if Joanne doesn't want their input, she shouldn't bring it up. The author's response seems like they're setting a boundary, which is important for mental health and team morale.\n\nBut wait, is the author being too direct? Maybe. The author is responding after three instances, which shows they had the chance to address it earlier but didn't. However, the key is that Joanne is using the same pattern each time\u2014asking for a compliment and then invalidating it. The author's comment is to stop the cycle, which could prevent others from feeling pressured to engage in harmful self-talk.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's response might come off as dismissive or hurtful. But given that Joanne was already dismissive of their compliments, the author is trying to stop the behavior. Also, considering the environment of a sports team where body image issues can be prevalent, the author's action is protective of their own and others' self-esteem.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're taking a stand against a behavior that's not only affecting them but potentially the whole team. The right answer here is B.\n"
