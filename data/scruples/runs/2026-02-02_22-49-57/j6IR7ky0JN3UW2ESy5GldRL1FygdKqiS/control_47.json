Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The situation is in a college sports team where weight isn't important. Joanne keeps making negative comments about her body and others, then dismisses their compliments. The author finally says to stop talking about it if she doesn't want opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The team has diverse body types, so body image issues might be common. Joanne is seeking validation but then invalidating others' feedback. The author's response is a direct way to address the cycle of seeking and dismissing compliments.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, Joanne's behavior could be promoting negative self-talk and body image issues, which isn't healthy. The author is trying to break that cycle by setting a boundary. But maybe the author could have handled it more sensitively? However, the question is about whether they're in the wrong. The author's intent was to stop the harmful behavior, so they're protecting the team's environment. Joanne's reaction is defensive, but the author's response is reasonable. So the answer is B, No.\n"
