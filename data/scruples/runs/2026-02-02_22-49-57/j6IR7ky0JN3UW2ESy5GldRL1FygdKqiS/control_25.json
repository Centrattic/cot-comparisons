Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the context: They're on a college sports team where weight isn't a factor. The team has diverse body types, and Joanne, who has a similar body to the author, frequently comments on her own weight, seeking compliments but then dismissing others' opinions. The author finally tells her not to talk about it if she doesn't want their input. Joanne reacts with an offended look.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author was wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider if the author's response was appropriate. Joanne was engaging in negative self-talk and seeking validation, which could contribute to a negative body image environment. The author tried to be supportive initially but then set a boundary when Joanne kept doing it to others. The author's statement seems like they were trying to stop the cycle of insecurity and unsolicited comments.\n\nOn the other hand, Joanne might feel that the author was being dismissive or rude by cutting her off. But the author's intent was to address the recurring behavior that others were also getting pulled into. In a team setting, fostering a positive environment is important, especially when it comes to body image issues which can be sensitive in sports teams.\n\nSo, the author's action was likely a reasonable boundary to prevent others from feeling pressured to give unsolicited comments and to discourage negative self-talk. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
