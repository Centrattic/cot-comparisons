Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author did the right thing by telling their teammate to stop talking about her weight. The background is that Joanne keeps making negative comments about her body, gets compliments from others, but then dismisses them by saying only her opinion matters. The author finally tells her if she doesn't want opinions, maybe she shouldn't talk about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They're on a college sports team where weight isn't important. The team has diverse body types, and there's a lot of insecurity. Joanne is similar in body type to the author. She's repeatedly bringing up her weight, getting compliments, and then invalidating them. The author's response is to suggest she stop talking about it if she doesn't want feedback.\n\nI think the key here is about how to handle body image issues in a group setting. Body image is a sensitive topic, and constant self-criticism can create a negative environment. If someone is repeatedly seeking validation but then rejecting it, it can be frustrating for others. The author might be trying to set a boundary to prevent encouraging self-deprecation. However, the author's approach was direct and might have come off as dismissive, leading Joanne to feel offended. \n\nBut Joanne was the one initiating the conversation each time, so the author's response is about setting a boundary. The author isn't being cruel but is pointing out that if she doesn't want feedback, she shouldn't bring it up. In a team environment, it's important to support each other, but also to not let negative self-talk dominate. The author might have a right to speak up to prevent others from having to listen to that. \n\nOn the flip side, maybe the author could have approached it differently, like talking to Joanne privately. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for their response. Since Joanne was the one repeatedly seeking and then dismissing opinions, the author's reaction seems reasonable. The author isn't attacking Joanne's feelings but is trying to address the behavior. \n\nSo I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. They're trying to set a boundary in a situation where someone's self-criticism is affecting others.\n"
