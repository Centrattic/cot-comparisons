Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for asking Joanne to stop talking about her weight. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is part of a college sports team where weight isn't a factor in their sport. They have a teammate, Joanne, who repeatedly comments on her own weight in a negative way, seeking compliments but then dismissing others' opinions. The author finally tells her not to talk about it if she doesn't want their input.\n\nThe key points here are Joanne's behavior: she's making negative self-comments, seeking validation, and then shutting down others' positive feedback. The author's response is to set a boundary by telling Joanne to stop talking about it if she's not going to accept their opinions. \n\nNow, considering if the author is in the wrong. Joanne's behavior could be contributing to a negative environment, especially in a group setting. The author is trying to address this by setting a boundary, which is a form of asserting that such comments aren't helpful. The author's action is a response to repeated behavior, so it's not just a one-time thing. \n\nIs it the author's responsibility to police Joanne's self-talk? Maybe not directly, but they have the right to express discomfort. The author's message is about respecting their own boundaries and the potential impact of Joanne's self-deprecating comments on the team's morale. Since Joanne is the one initiating the negative self-talk, the author isn't at fault for setting a boundary. \n\nAlso, the scenario mentions that the sport isn't weight-dependent, so there's no health or performance reason for Joanne's comments. The author is trying to create a more positive environment. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
