Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their teammate Joanne to stop talking about her weight. Let's break down the situation.\n\nSo, the background is that they're on a college sports team where weight doesn't matter. The author and Joanne have similar body types, and there's a lot of insecurity. Joanne starts talking about how she's fat, the author tries to compliment her, but Joanne dismisses it. This happens three times with different teammates. Then the author says, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us,\" which makes Joanne offended.\n\nThe question is whether the author was right or wrong. The options are A (wrong) or B (not wrong). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is trying to protect their teammates from negative self-talk. Joanne is constantly seeking validation but then dismissing others' opinions. The author is setting a boundary because Joanne's behavior is affecting others. \n\nIn terms of body image issues, it's common for people to feel insecure, especially in environments where appearance might be a concern. However, in this case, the sport doesn't care about weight, so there's no objective reason for Joanne to focus on her weight. The author is probably trying to prevent others from getting caught up in that cycle of insecurity. \n\nBut was the author's response too harsh? They told Joanne not to talk about it if she didn't want opinions. That could be seen as cutting off a conversation she started. However, the author might have felt that Joanne was using others as a sounding board for her insecurities, which isn't healthy. \n\nOn the other hand, Joanne's response was defensive, which might indicate she felt criticized. The author's intention was to stop the negative talk without being confrontational. In group settings, especially with peers, setting boundaries is important for mental health. \n\nI think the key here is that the author is standing up for themselves and others by not allowing negative self-talk to continue. It's a form of support to prevent others from internalizing those insecurities. So the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
