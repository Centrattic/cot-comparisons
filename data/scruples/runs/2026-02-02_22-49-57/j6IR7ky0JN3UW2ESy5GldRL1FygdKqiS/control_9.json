Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the background: They're on a college sports team where weight isn't an issue. Joanne is similar in body type to the author. Joanne keeps complaining about her weight, asking for compliments, and then dismissing others' opinions. The author finally tells her to stop if she doesn't want their opinions.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about body image, peer interactions, and how to handle negative self-talk. \n\nJoanne is engaging in self-criticism and seeking validation, which is common, especially among young women in sports where body image can be a concern. However, the author is trying to set a boundary by saying if Joanne doesn't want their opinions, she shouldn't bring it up. The author's intention might be to stop the negative talk and encourage a positive environment.\n\nOn one hand, the author is standing up against body-shaming and promoting self-acceptance. It's important to address negative self-talk, especially in group settings where it can affect others. The author might be trying to create a supportive atmosphere.\n\nOn the other hand, Joanne might feel that the author is being dismissive or too direct. However, the author isn't attacking Joanne but pointing out that if she doesn't want feedback, she shouldn't invite it. The author's response seems reasonable because it's about setting boundaries, not making a personal attack.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's action is a way to address repetitive negative behavior. The problem here is Joanne's self-criticism and seeking validation. The author's response is a constructive way to handle it without encouraging the behavior. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
