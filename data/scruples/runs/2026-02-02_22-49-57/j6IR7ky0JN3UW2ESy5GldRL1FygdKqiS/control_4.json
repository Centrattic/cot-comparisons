Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. So, the situation is that Joanne keeps complaining about her weight, getting compliments from teammates, but then dismissing their opinions by saying only her own matters. The author finally tells her not to talk about it if she doesn't want their opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They're on a sports team where weight isn't an issue, and there's a variety of body types. Joanne's behavior is making others uncomfortable. She does this multiple times, each time after getting a compliment. The author's response is to tell her to stop talking about her weight if she doesn't want their opinions. The author's main concern is probably the negative impact on the team's environment and Joanne's self-esteem issues.\n\nNow, thinking about body image issues. It's common for young women to have insecurities, especially in sports. The author is trying to address the problem by setting a boundary. But is that appropriate? Maybe the author could have handled it differently, like talking to Joanne privately instead of in front of others. However, Joanne was being dismissive each time, so the author might feel frustrated. \n\nAnother angle is the intention behind the author's words. They wanted to stop the cycle of insecurity and negative self-talk that affects the team. If Joanne was being offensive or making others uncomfortable, the author is protecting the group. But if Joanne was just expressing her own feelings without forcing them on others, maybe the author overstepped. However, the key here is that Joanne was seeking validation and then invalidating others' input. The author's response is about stopping that pattern.\n\nAlso, considering the response from Joanne\u2014she was offended. That suggests maybe the way it was said could have been more diplomatic. But the author's message was clear: if Joanne doesn't want feedback, she shouldn't bring it up. That's a reasonable boundary. The author isn't bullying Joanne but setting a limit to prevent the team from being dragged into her self-criticism.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Maybe the author should have addressed it more compassionately. However, the situation describes multiple instances, so the author might have run out of patience. The team environment is important, and constant negativity about body image isn't healthy. The author is trying to create a positive space.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's action was a way to set a boundary in response to repeated behavior that's affecting the team. They're not wrong for doing that. The answer should be B (No).\n"
