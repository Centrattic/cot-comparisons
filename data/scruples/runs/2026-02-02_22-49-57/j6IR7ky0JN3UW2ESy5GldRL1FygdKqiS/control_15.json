Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. So, the background is that they're on a college sports team where weight isn't a factor. Joanne keeps complaining about her body and then dismissing others' opinions. The author finally tells her not to talk about it if she doesn't want their opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The team has a variety of body types, so there's likely a lot of pressure. Joanne's behavior seems like she's seeking validation but then invalidating it. The author's response was to set a boundary by saying if she doesn't want their opinions, don't bring it up. \n\nIs the author wrong? Well, setting boundaries around body image talk is important, especially in environments where it can foster insecurity. Joanne's actions might contribute to a negative environment. The author is trying to prevent constant negative self-talk. However, there's a line between setting boundaries and being dismissive. The author's approach was direct, but maybe there's a better way, like a private conversation. But in the context of a team where such comments could affect others, the author's action makes sense. \n\nAlso, the fact that Joanne did this to multiple people suggests it's a pattern. The author's response was to address the behavior after it happened three times. It's about creating a supportive environment. So, the answer is probably B (Not in the wrong). They were protecting the team's morale and setting healthy boundaries.\n"
