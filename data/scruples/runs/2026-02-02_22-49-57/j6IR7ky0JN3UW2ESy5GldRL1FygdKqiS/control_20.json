Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight.\n\nFirst, the context is a college sports team where weight isn't a factor in performance. The team has diverse body types, and Joanne is someone with a similar build to the author. The issue here is Joanne's repeated behavior of complaining about her weight, seeking compliments, then dismissing others' opinions. The author finally tells her to stop if she doesn't want their opinions.\n\nIn these situations, it's important to consider body image issues and the impact of negative self-talk. Joanne's behavior might indicate underlying insecurities, which are common, especially in young athletes. However, the author's response was to set a boundary after multiple instances. The key points here are consent and mutual respect. If Joanne kept bringing up the topic, seeking validation but then invalidating others' input, the author might feel that they're not being heard or respected. The author's message was a form of setting a boundary, which is a valid action when someone feels their comfort is being disregarded.\n\nNow, considering the potential for the author to be in the wrong: Could the author have handled it differently? Maybe. Approaching Joanne privately to express concern about the repeated comments might have been a gentler approach. However, the author's public comment was a direct response to ongoing behavior, which might be seen as necessary to address the issue.\n\nOn the other hand, Joanne might feel that the author was dismissive of her feelings. But since the author was responding to repeated behavior, it's a balance between respecting Joanne's feelings and the author's boundaries. The team environment should foster positivity and support, so the author's intervention might be seen as promoting a healthier environment by discouraging negative self-talk.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, it's often considered okay to set boundaries when someone's behavior affects your well-being. The author isn't attacking Joanne but rather addressing the behavior. So, I think the answer leans towards B (the author is not in the wrong) because they're setting a boundary in response to repeated actions that create discomfort.\n"
