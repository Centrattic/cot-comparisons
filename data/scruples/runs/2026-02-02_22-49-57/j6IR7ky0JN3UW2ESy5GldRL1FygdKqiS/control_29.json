Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong after telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The background is that Joanne keeps commenting on her own weight and then dismissing others' compliments. The author finally tells her not to talk about it if she doesn't want opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They're on a college sports team where weight isn't a factor in the sport. The team has diverse body types, which suggests that there's some pressure or insecurity around body image. Joanne is making negative self-comments and then pushing back against the compliments. The author's response is to set a boundary, saying if she doesn't want opinions, don't talk about it. \n\nNow, is the author wrong? The key here is whether the author overstepped or if their action was a reasonable boundary. Joanne was seeking validation but then dismissing it, which can be frustrating for others. The author's response is to stop engaging, which is a way to protect themselves from the negative self-talk. \n\nIn situations where someone is constantly bringing up insecurities and then invalidating others' support, it's reasonable to set boundaries. The author isn't attacking Joanne but is asking her to stop initiating the topic. The response seems justified as a way to prevent the conversation from continuing in a harmful way. \n\nAlso, considering the team environment, promoting a positive body image is important. By redirecting the conversation, the author might be helping to create a healthier space. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. They're taking a stand against the negative self-talk that's affecting the team dynamics. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
