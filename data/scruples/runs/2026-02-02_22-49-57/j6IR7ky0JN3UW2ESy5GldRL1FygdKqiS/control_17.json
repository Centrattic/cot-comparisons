Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for telling their teammate to stop talking about her weight. The situation is that Joanne keeps making negative comments about her body, and the author finally tells her to stop asking for compliments if she doesn't want their opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sport team has diverse body types, and weight isn't a factor in their performance. Joanne's behavior is about body insecurity, which is a common issue, especially among young women. The author tried to reassure her twice but Joanne dismissed the compliments each time, leading the author to set a boundary.\n\nThe key points here are about body image and how to handle it. Joanne's negative self-talk could be harmful, especially in a group setting where others might internalize it. The author's response seems to be trying to protect both themselves and the team from the negative comments. By setting a boundary, the author is encouraging Joanne to stop seeking validation through self-criticism, which might be a healthier approach.\n\nHowever, the author's approach was direct. They told Joanne to stop talking about it if she doesn't want opinions. Joanne's reaction was defensive. Is the author wrong for doing this? Well, the author isn't attacking Joanne's weight; they're asking her to stop the self-deprecating behavior. The team environment might benefit from such a boundary to prevent body shaming. The author's intent seems to be positive\u2014stopping the cycle of seeking compliments after self-criticism.\n\nBut maybe there's a more supportive way to handle it. The author could have encouraged Joanne to focus on strengths or offered support without confrontation. However, the situation shows that Joanne repeated the behavior three times, which might have made the author's response necessary to break the pattern. In a team setting, mutual respect is important, and the author is asserting their right to not engage in the negative talk.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're trying to address a harmful pattern of self-criticism in a group setting. The answer leans towards B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
