Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the background: They're on a college sports team where body types vary. Joanne is similar in build to the author. Joanne starts talking about her weight, saying she's fat. The author tells her she looks great. Joanne responds that only her opinion matters. This happens three times with different teammates. Then the author tells her not to talk about it if she doesn't want opinions. Joanne gets offended.\n\nSo the key points here are body image issues, repeated negative self-talk, and the author's response. The author is trying to stop Joanne from bringing up her weight, which is affecting the team's dynamics. The question is whether the author's response was appropriate.\n\nBody shaming is a big issue, so the author is probably trying to be supportive by complimenting Joanne. But Joanne keeps pushing back. The author's final comment is about not talking about it if she doesn't want feedback. The author isn't shaming her; instead, they're setting a boundary. Given that Joanne keeps doing this, maybe the author had a right to speak up. Teammates might be uncomfortable hearing this repeatedly. So the answer is likely B, the author isn't in the wrong. They're trying to address negative self-talk and set boundaries.\n"
