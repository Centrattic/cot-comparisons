Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a college sports team member, the author, who confronts a teammate, Joanne, about her constant negative comments about her weight.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The key points are that weight isn't a factor in their sport, and the team has diverse body types. Joanne is being critical of her own body in front of others, seeking compliments but then dismissing others' opinions. The author tried to compliment her initially, but after Joanne repeated this behavior with others, the author finally tells her to stop bringing it up if she doesn't want their opinions.\n\nNow, considering if the author is at fault. The main issue is whether it's appropriate to address someone's body image concerns, especially when it's affecting others. The author might be standing up for their teammates and trying to create a healthier environment by discouraging negative self-talk. On the other hand, maybe the author should have handled it more privately or with more sensitivity.\n\nBut the problem here is that Joanne is repeatedly seeking validation and then invalidating others' input. The author's response is to set a boundary, which could be seen as necessary to prevent fostering insecurity in others. The author isn't attacking Joanne's body but is pointing out that if she doesn't want their opinions, she shouldn't ask for them. That seems like a reasonable response to prevent others from being caught in the cycle of negative self-talk followed by dismissive behavior.\n\nSo, the author is trying to maintain a positive environment and set boundaries. It's not about criticizing Joanne's weight but about the way she's approaching others for validation. The author isn't wrong for wanting to stop the cycle of insecurity. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
