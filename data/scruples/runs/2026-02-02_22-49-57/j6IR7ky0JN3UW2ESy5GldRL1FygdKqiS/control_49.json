Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The situation is in a college sports team where weight isn't important. Joanne keeps commenting on her own weight, getting compliments, then dismissing them. The author finally tells her not to talk about it if she doesn't want opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The team has diverse body types, and weight isn't a factor in their sport. So, the author's sport isn't focused on weight classes, which is good. Joanne is making negative comments about her body, which can create a negative environment. The author is trying to address this by setting a boundary.\n\nJoanne's behavior is about seeking validation through compliments, then dismissing others' opinions. The author's response is to tell her not to talk about it if she doesn't want input. That seems fair because Joanne is creating a situation where others feel she's fishing for compliments, which can be exhausting for others. The author is protecting the team environment from unnecessary negative body talk.\n\nPossible angles: Is it the author's place to tell someone to stop talking about their own body? Well, if Joanne is doing it to multiple people and making them uncomfortable, then the author has a right to address it. Also, promoting body positivity and avoiding negative self-talk is important in a team setting. The author's response is direct but not confrontational, just setting a boundary.\n\nAnother point: The author might be preventing others from engaging in harmful behavior by not allowing such conversations. So, the author isn't in the wrong here. The answer would be B (No). The author is taking a stand against negative body image talk in a team where it's unnecessary.\n"
