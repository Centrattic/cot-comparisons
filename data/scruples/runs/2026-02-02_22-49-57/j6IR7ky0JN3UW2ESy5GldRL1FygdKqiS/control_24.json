Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a college sports team where weight isn't important. The author, a teammate, tells Joanne to stop talking about her weight after Joanne repeatedly does so, seeking compliments but then dismissing others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. In a team where body types vary and weight isn't a factor in their sport, body image issues might be common. Joanne is making negative comments about herself, and the author is trying to stop it. The key points here are the author's intent and the appropriateness of their response.\n\nThe author's teammates are also being approached by Joanne, who then invalidates their opinions. The author steps in by saying if Joanne doesn't want their opinions, maybe she shouldn't talk about it. The question is whether this response is appropriate.\n\nOn one hand, the author is trying to address the issue of Joanne's negative self-talk and the cycle of seeking validation. It's possible that the author wants to prevent others from feeling the need to comment, which might not help Joanne. The author's response could be seen as a way to set a boundary to stop the pattern.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's approach might come off as dismissive or confrontational. Joanne might feel that the author is being judgmental or not supportive, especially since she was already defensive. The way the author phrased it could be perceived as harsh, even if the intention was good.\n\nBut considering that Joanne kept bringing up the topic despite the negative self-talk, the author might be trying to protect the team's morale. The author's teammates could also be affected by the constant negativity. In that case, the author's response is a way to address the behavior without enabling it further.\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong. They were trying to stop a cycle of negative self-talk and set a boundary. The response, while maybe a bit direct, was in response to repeated behavior. The key is that the author was encouraging a healthier environment by not allowing others to feel they need to provide reassurance. So the answer would be B.\n"
