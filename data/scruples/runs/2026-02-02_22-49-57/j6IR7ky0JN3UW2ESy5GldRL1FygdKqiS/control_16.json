Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The scenario is that Joanne keeps commenting on her own weight, seeking compliments, and then dismissing others' opinions. The author finally tells her to stop doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the situation. Weight and body image are sensitive topics, especially in sports. The fact that Joanne is doing this to multiple teammates suggests a pattern. The author's response was to set a boundary, which is common when someone feels their comments are being used for validation but then ignored. The author's action was direct: telling her that if she doesn't want feedback, she shouldn't bring it up. \n\nNow, considering the context: the sport doesn't prioritize weight, so there's no actual reason for the insecurity. Joanne's behavior might be fostering a negative environment. The author's intervention could be seen as protecting others from her comments and setting a boundary. \n\nBut is the author at fault? Well, the author didn't attack Joanne; they simply addressed the behavior. Joanne's reaction was being offended, but the author's words were factual\u2014since Joanne was seeking opinions but then dismissing them. There's no evidence the author was mean, just direct. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have handled it more gently, like a private conversation first. But given that Joanne repeated the behavior with others, the author's public response might be justified to prevent future occurrences. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're addressing a recurring issue that affects others. The answer should be B (No).\n"
