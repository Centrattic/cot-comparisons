Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The situation is in a college sports team where weight isn't important. Joanne keeps complaining about her body and then dismissing others' compliments. The author gets fed up and tells her not to talk about it if she doesn't want opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The team has diverse body types, and Joanne's behavior is causing insecurity. The author is trying to address the negative self-talk and the cycle of seeking compliments. The author's response was direct, which might come off as harsh, but maybe it's a valid way to stop the pattern.\n\nJoanne's actions involve seeking validation but then invalidating others' input. The author's intention is to break that cycle. The key points are whether the author overstepped and if the response was appropriate.\n\nIn terms of social dynamics, it's important to support teammates but also set boundaries. The author's response was a bit abrupt, but given that Joanne was doing this multiple times, the author's frustration is understandable. It's a balance between being supportive and not enabling negative self-talk.\n\nPossible angle: The author isn't in the wrong because they're addressing a harmful pattern, but could have handled it more gently. However, the question is about being in the wrong. If Joanne's behavior is harmful to the team's morale, the author's intervention is justified. So the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
