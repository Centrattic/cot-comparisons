Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. Let's see the background.\n\nThe author is on a college sports team where weight isn't important. The team has various body types. Joanne, a teammate with a similar build, keeps complaining about her weight. The author tried to compliment her, but Joanne dismissed it. She did the same to two others. Then the author told her not to talk about it if she doesn't want opinions. Joanne got offended.\n\nFirst, the author's intent was to stop the negative self-talk. The team environment might be sensitive since they have different body types and it's a sport where weight isn't a factor. Joanne's behavior might be causing insecurity in others. But was the author right to confront her directly?\n\nOn one hand, the author is standing up for themselves and others by setting a boundary. It's possible Joanne's comments are affecting the team's morale. On the other hand, maybe the author should have approached it more gently, like talking to Joanne privately first instead of in front of others. But the author had already tried individual responses. The statement \"if you don't want our opinions...\" could be seen as a bit abrupt, but it's a valid way to set a boundary. The author isn't in the wrong because they're creating a positive environment by addressing the issue. So probably answer B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
