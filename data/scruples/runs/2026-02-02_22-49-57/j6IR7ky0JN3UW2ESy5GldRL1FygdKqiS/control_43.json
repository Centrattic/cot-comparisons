Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their teammate to stop talking about her weight. The situation is in a college sports team where weight isn't a factor in their sport. The teammate, Joanne, keeps making negative comments about her body, and the author finally tells her to stop if she doesn't want their opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The team has diverse body types, and the author's own body type is similar to Joanne's. Joanne's behavior seems to be seeking validation through compliments but then dismissing them, which can create a negative environment. The author's response was to set a boundary by saying if she doesn't want their opinions, maybe she shouldn't talk about it around them. \n\nFrom a psychological standpoint, body image issues are common, especially in young women. The author tried to be supportive initially by complimenting Joanne, but when that didn't work, they decided to draw a line. The key here is whether the author's actions were appropriate in setting boundaries or if they were dismissive.\n\nIn group settings, especially among peers, it's important to foster a supportive atmosphere. However, constant negative self-talk can be draining for others. The author might have felt that Joanne's behavior was affecting the team's morale or creating an uncomfortable environment. By setting a boundary, the author is promoting a healthier dynamic, encouraging Joanne to take responsibility for her own self-talk, and perhaps even model positive behavior.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author could have handled it more gently, using empathy or suggesting a private conversation. However, the scenario mentions that Joanne repeated this behavior three times, which could justify the author's frustration. The response was a direct but reasonable way to address the issue without being confrontational.\n\nAlso, considering that the sport doesn't require a specific weight, there's no performance-related concern here. The issue is purely about Joanne's self-image and how her comments affect others. The author's response helps in maintaining a supportive environment by not enabling the negative self-talk.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's action was a reasonable boundary-setting measure to protect the team's environment from constant negativity. They weren't dismissing Joanne's feelings entirely but were addressing the impact of her behavior on others. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
