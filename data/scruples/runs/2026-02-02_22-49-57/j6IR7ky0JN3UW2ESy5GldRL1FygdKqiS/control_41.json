Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The situation is in a college sports team where weight isn't a factor. Joanne is complaining about her weight, and the author finally tells her not to do that if she doesn't want opinions.\n\nHmm, first, I need to understand the dynamics here. The author's teammates, including Joanne, are insecure about their bodies. Joanne repeatedly brings up her weight, gets compliments, but then dismisses them. The author intervenes by saying if she doesn't want their opinions, she shouldn't talk about it. Joanne gets offended.\n\nSo, the key points are about body image issues and how to handle them in a team setting. The author's action is to set a boundary by telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight if she doesn't want feedback. The question is whether that's wrong.\n\nI should consider if the author's response was appropriate. Joanne was seeking validation but then dismissing others' input. The author is trying to stop the cycle where others feel pressured to give compliments, which might not be healthy. Maybe the author is right in stopping the negative self-talk and unnecessary pressure on others.\n\nBut is the author wrong? Well, Joanne might feel that she has the right to express her feelings. However, the author isn't forbidding her from talking about it but is addressing the pattern where she's fishing for compliments. The author's response could be seen as standing up for others and the team environment.\n\nIn terms of body positivity, it's important to address the underlying issues, but the author's approach might be a bit abrupt. However, given that Joanne was using others for validation and then dismissing their input, the author's action is a way to set a boundary. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The answer might be B, No.\n"
