Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a college sports team where weight isn't important. The main person is talking to a teammate, Joanne, who's been making negative comments about her body. The author told Joanne she looks great, but Joanne dismissed it. Then the author told Joanne to stop talking about her weight if she doesn't want opinions. The question is whether the author was wrong to say that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Weight isn't a factor in their sport, and there's a variety of body types. Joanne's behavior seems to be seeking reassurance but then invalidating others' positive feedback. The author's response was to set a boundary by saying if Joanne doesn't want opinions, maybe she shouldn't talk about it. \n\nNow, thinking about the dynamics here. Body image issues are common, especially among young women in sports. Joanne's actions might stem from insecurity. The author's response was direct but might come off as dismissive. However, the author was trying to address the repetitive behavior and the invalidation of others' kind words. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Maybe not. They were standing up for themselves and others who were being pulled into Joanne's cycle of seeking and dismissing compliments. The response was about setting a boundary, which is a valid approach when someone's behavior is affecting others. However, the way it was phrased could be seen as a bit harsh. But given the context, it's clear the author was trying to address a recurring issue.\n\nOn the other hand, Joanne might feel that the author was cutting her off without understanding her insecurities. But the key here is that Joanne was repeatedly doing this to others, making it a pattern. The author's response was a way to stop enabling that behavior. So, I think the author is justified in their response. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
