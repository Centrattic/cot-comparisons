Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The context is that Joanne keeps making negative comments about her body and then dismisses others' compliments. The author tried to be supportive but then set a boundary after Joanne repeated the behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Body image issues are common, especially in college athletes where there might be pressure even if the sport isn't weight-dependent. Joanne's behavior sounds like she's seeking validation but then invalidating the responses. The author's response was to tell her not to talk about it if she doesn't want opinions. \n\nIs the author wrong for setting that boundary? The key points are consent to the conversation and the impact of the comments. By saying \"if you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it,\" the author is asserting that if Joanne is going to make comments, she's inviting feedback. The author isn't being cruel but is instead redirecting the conversation. \n\nHowever, maybe the author could have handled it differently. But the question is whether they're in the wrong. Since Joanne was the one initiating the conversation and then dismissing the input, the author's reaction seems reasonable. The author isn't attacking Joanne's body image issues but is protecting the group from negative self-talk. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong. They were standing up for themselves and others by setting a boundary against unnecessary body talk that leads to insecurity.\n"
