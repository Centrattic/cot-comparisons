Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The background is that Joanne was making negative comments about her body and seeking validation from others, then dismissing their responses. The author intervened by saying if Joanne doesn't want their opinions, she shouldn't bring it up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. In a college sports team, body image issues can be common, especially in sports where weight isn't a factor. Joanne's behavior seems to be seeking reassurance but then invalidating others' input. The author's response was to set a boundary, which might be a way to protect others from the negative comments or to address the cycle of seeking and dismissing compliments.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, Joanne was initiating the conversation about her weight. The author was defending her by saying she's not fat, but Joanne brushed it off. Then, the author took a stand to stop the behavior. The key here is whether the author overstepped or was justified in setting a boundary.\n\nIn group settings, especially among peers, it's important to foster a supportive environment. If Joanne was using negative self-talk that could affect others or contribute to a toxic atmosphere, the author's action might be appropriate. However, if Joanne was just expressing her feelings and the author's response was dismissive or harsh, that could be an issue. But the author's statement seems to be a reasonable boundary: if you don't want feedback, don't bring it up. That's not necessarily wrong. It's about mutual respect.\n\nAnother angle: body image discussions can be sensitive. The author might have been trying to prevent others from feeling pressured to comment or to stop a cycle of insecurity. On the other hand, Joanne might feel that her comments were personal and the author shouldn't dictate what she can talk about. But since the author was part of the team and saw the pattern with multiple teammates, stepping in could be supportive.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They were protecting the group's dynamic by setting a boundary. Answer B.\n"
