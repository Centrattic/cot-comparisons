Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The situation is in a college sports team where weight isn't important. Joanne is making negative comments about herself, and the author tells her that if she doesn't want opinions, maybe she shouldn't talk about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The sport doesn't care about weight, so body image issues might be a problem here. Joanne is trying to get compliments but then dismissing them. The author is trying to stop the negative talk, which could be harmful, especially in a team environment where body image issues can spread.\n\nIs the author being too harsh? Well, Joanne initiated the conversation by complaining about her weight. The author responded by trying to be supportive but Joanne dismissed their comment. Then she did the same to two others. The author's final response is about setting a boundary. If someone is constantly seeking validation and then invalidating the responses, maybe it's reasonable to set a boundary.\n\nBut maybe the author could have handled it differently. Like, maybe talking to Joanne privately instead of in front of others? But the author's intention seems to be about stopping the cycle of negative self-talk and preventing others from feeling pressured to give unsolicited advice.\n\nThe key point is whether the author overstepped. Since Joanne was the one bringing up the topic and then dismissing the compliments, the author isn't in the wrong for setting a boundary. The author is protecting the team's environment from negative body talk, which is a valid concern. So the answer is B, No.\n"
