  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for asking her to stop talking about her weight\nBackground: I'm on a college sports team. Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a college sports team where the author confronted a teammate, Joanne, for repeatedly talking about her weight in a negative way. The team's sport doesn't focus on weight, so there's a mix of body types. Joanne, who is similar in build, keeps complaining about her weight and then dismisses others' positive comments. The author told her to stop talking about it if she doesn't want their opinions.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about body image, peer influence, and setting boundaries. Joanne is engaging in self-criticism and seeking validation, then rejecting it. The author steps in to set a boundary, which Joanne found offensive. Now, the question is whether that boundary was appropriate.\n\nOn one hand, the author might be right in trying to prevent negative self-talk, especially in a team setting where such comments could affect others. It's important to foster a positive environment. However, the author directly told Joanne to stop, which might come off as dismissive or not validating Joanne's feelings.\n\nBut considering that Joanne was using others' compliments only to dismiss them, the author's response could be seen as a way to put an end to the cycle. The author isn't attacking Joanne's feelings but rather the unnecessary focus on weight in a context where it doesn't matter. The team's sport is inclusive of different body types, so the concern is misplaced. The author's approach might be a way to protect the team from harmful habits.\n\nHowever, maybe there's a better way to handle it, like addressing Joanne's insecurities without confrontation. But the author's intention was to stop the behavior, which is understandable. Since Joanne kept doing it despite others' attempts to compliment, the author's response was a clear boundary. In that case, it's not the author's fault for setting that boundary. So, I think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
