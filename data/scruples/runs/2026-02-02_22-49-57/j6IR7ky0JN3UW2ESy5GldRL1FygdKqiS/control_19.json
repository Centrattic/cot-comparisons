Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story was wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The situation involves a college sports team where weight isn't a factor in their sport. The writer and Joanne have similar body types, and Joanne frequently expresses body image concerns, seeking validation from others but dismissing their opinions when given.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social dynamics here. Joanne is engaging in negative self-talk about her body, which might be a sign of insecurity or an eating disorder. The writer initially tries to reassure her, but Joanne keeps doing it to others, leading the writer to set a boundary. \n\nThe key point is whether the writer was wrong to set that boundary. The writer says, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" This is a direct response to Joanne's repeated behavior. The writer might feel that Joanne is using the team as a sounding board for her insecurities without really wanting constructive feedback. \n\nIn terms of body image issues, it's important to be supportive, but also to consider the well-being of the group. If Joanne is fostering a negative environment by constantly bringing up her weight, the writer has a right to speak up. However, the way the boundary was set might come off as abrupt. The writer could have approached it more compassionately, perhaps by addressing Joanne's behavior without making her feel accused. \n\nBut the core issue is the writer's right to set boundaries. Since Joanne was persistently undermining the efforts to uplift her by dismissing others' opinions, the writer's frustration is understandable. The response, while maybe not the most tactful, is a form of self-advocacy. The writer isn't in the wrong for standing up for themselves and the team's positive environment. So the answer is B.\n"
