Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the context is a college sports team where weight isn't a factor in their sport. The team has various body types, so there's probably a lot of diversity. Joanne, a teammate, has a similar build to the author\u2014slim with muscular legs. There's general insecurity among the young women about their looks.\n\nJoanne starts by looking at herself in the mirror, poking her belly, and saying \"I'm so fat.\" The author responds with a compliment, but Joanne dismisses it by saying only her opinion matters. This happens three times with different teammates, each time Joanne seeks a compliment but downplays others' opinions. Finally, the author tells her not to talk about it if she doesn't want their input, which offends Joanne.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author is trying to stop Joanne from engaging in negative self-talk, which is common in environments with body image issues. The author's response is direct but seems to come from a place of wanting to protect teammates from body-shaming. However, Joanne's behavior is seeking validation, which can be a sign of insecurity. The author's approach might be seen as cutting off a conversation that others might not want to have, but on the other hand, Joanne is possibly creating a negative environment by discussing her weight in a way that might affect others.\n\nI need to consider if the author's response was appropriate. By saying, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us,\" the author is setting a boundary. This could be a way to prevent others from feeling pressured to comment or to avoid perpetuating negative self-talk. But did they overstep? If Joanne's comments are a personal matter, maybe the author shouldn't police her. However, if others are also being asked for opinions and then dismissed, the author's intervention might be justified to stop a cycle of insecurity.\n\nAlso, the author's teammates are likely in the same boat, so creating a supportive environment is important. The author's action could be seen as fostering a positive space. However, it's possible that the author should have addressed it more gently or through a different approach, like a private conversation. But given the situation, the public response might be necessary to stop the pattern.\n\nIn terms of social norms, sometimes people who are insecure seek validation and then invalidate others' attempts to help. The author's response is a way to say that if Joanne doesn't want to hear supportive comments, she shouldn't bring it up. That makes sense because it's about mutual respect. However, Joanne's reaction might indicate that the author's approach was too direct, but maybe the author isn't in the wrong for trying to set that boundary.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's action was likely not in the wrong. They're trying to create a positive environment and stop a cycle of negative self-talk. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
