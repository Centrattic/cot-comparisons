Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a college sports team where weight isn't a factor in their sport. The author's teammate, Joanne, keeps complaining about her weight and then dismissing others' compliments by saying only her own opinion matters. The author finally tells her to stop talking about it if she doesn't want their opinions. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The team has varied body types, and there's already a lot of insecurity. Joanne is repeatedly bringing up her weight, seeking validation but then invalidating others' input. The author intervenes after three instances. The key point is whether the author overstepped or acted appropriately.\n\nThe author's response was to tell Joanne to stop talking about her weight if she doesn't want their opinions. This is a direct but firm way to set a boundary. Since Joanne was initiating the conversation each time and then dismissing others' input, the author is protecting their teammates from unnecessary negativity. The author might be trying to create a more positive environment.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author was dismissive of Joanne's feelings. Joanne might have been struggling with body image issues, and the author's response could be seen as cutting her off instead of offering support. But Joanne had already dismissed others' compliments three times, so the author's action might be a way to stop the cycle of negative self-talk in the group.\n\nAnother angle is that the author is standing up against toxic behavior. If Joanne keeps causing discomfort by talking about her weight in a way that undermines others' input, the author is right to address it. The key is that Joanne was seeking validation but then invalidating others, which can create a toxic environment. The author's response is a way to set boundaries and protect the team's morale.\n\nIn the end, the author's action seems justified. They're not shaming Joanne directly but are pointing out that if she's going to seek opinions and then disregard them, she shouldn't bring it up. It's about setting a boundary rather than being mean. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
