Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The situation is about someone (the author) telling a teammate, Joanne, to stop talking about her weight because it's making the author uncomfortable. Joanne is repeatedly bringing up her body image issues, seeking reassurance but then dismissing others' opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. They're on a college sports team where body types vary, and weight isn't a factor in their sport. Joanne's comments seem to be about personal insecurity rather than a health or performance issue. The author is tired of Joanne's negative self-talk and tries to set a boundary by saying if she doesn't want opinions, she shouldn't bring it up. Joanne reacts with offense.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author's intention was to protect their own comfort and set boundaries, which is understandable. People have the right to set limits on topics that make them uncomfortable. However, the author might have handled it differently. Maybe a more supportive approach, like discussing the impact of such comments without cutting off the conversation entirely, could have been better. But the author isn't being cruel; they're just trying to stop the cycle of seeking reassurance and then dismissing it.\n\nJoanne's behavior could be harmful if others feel pressured to comment or if it fosters a negative environment. The author's response is a way to address that without engaging further. Since Joanne was the one initiating the conversation, the author isn't wrong for wanting to stop the discussion. The answer seems to be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're setting a boundary in a respectful way, even if the approach could be improved.\n"
