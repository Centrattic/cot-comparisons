Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The situation is that Joanne keeps commenting on her own weight, getting compliments, but then dismissing them by saying only her opinion matters. The author finally tells her to stop if she doesn't want their opinions.\n\nHmm, first, I need to assess if the author's actions were appropriate. Weight is a sensitive topic, especially for athletes who might have body image issues. Joanne is clearly struggling with self-esteem here. The author tried to be kind by giving a compliment each time, but Joanne keeps invalidating them. So when the author sets a boundary, is that wrong?\n\nWell, the author isn't attacking Joanne. They're just pointing out that if Joanne doesn't want feedback, she shouldn't bring it up. It's about setting boundaries in social interactions. People can get defensive, but the author isn't bullying them. The issue is that Joanne's actions are self-deprecating, which isn't healthy, and the author is trying to address the cycle of seeking validation and then rejecting it.\n\nI think the author is right to set that boundary. It's important to encourage positive self-image and not engage in negative self-talk. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
