Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a college sports team where weight isn't a factor. The author, who's part of the team, tried to stop a teammate, Joanne, from discussing her weight because Joanne kept making negative comments and dismissing others' compliments.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The sport doesn't prioritize weight, so body image might be a sensitive topic. Joanne was repeatedly bringing up her insecurities, and the author intervened after three instances. The key points are: Joanne was seeking reassurance but then invalidating others' opinions, and the author told her not to talk about it if she doesn't want feedback. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. From a perspective of respecting others' feelings, the author was trying to prevent Joanne from undermining the team's morale by focusing on negative self-talk. However, Joanne might feel that the author was dismissing her feelings or being judgmental. \n\nBut the author didn't attack Joanne's body; they just asked her to stop the conversation if she doesn't want others' input. It seems like the author was trying to set a boundary to avoid encouraging toxic behavior. In a team setting, promoting a positive environment is important. Joanne's behavior could spread insecurity, so the author's response might be seen as a way to maintain a healthy atmosphere. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author could have addressed it more gently, but the action of saying \"if you don't want our opinions, don't talk about it around us\" is a reasonable boundary. The author isn't body-shaming; they're trying to prevent self-deprecating comments that could affect others. So the answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
