Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for telling Joanne to stop talking about her weight. The situation is that Joanne keeps making negative comments about her body, gets compliments from others, but then dismisses them by saying only her opinion matters. The author finally tells her to stop talking about it if she doesn't want their opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The team includes a variety of body types, which is good. Joanne is similar to the author in body type but seems to have body insecurity. She pokes at her belly, looks in the mirror, and calls herself fat multiple times. Each time, others try to reassure her, but she brushes it off. \n\nThe author's response is to tell her not to talk about it if she doesn't want their opinions. The key here is whether the author overstepped. On one hand, Joanne is seeking validation but then rejecting it, which can be frustrating. The author is trying to set a boundary, which might be necessary to stop the negative self-talk. \n\nBut on the other hand, maybe the author could have handled it more sensitively. However, Joanne's behavior seems to be the main issue here. She's the one bringing up the topic repeatedly and not accepting positive feedback. The author is essentially saying that if she doesn't want input, she shouldn't initiate the conversation. That seems reasonable. \n\nAlso, considering the context of a sports team, body image issues can be common, especially in sports where there's a range of body types. The author's teammates are trying to support Joanne, but she's not accepting it. The author's response is a logical conclusion after multiple instances. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they're setting a boundary in response to Joanne's behavior. Joanne started the conversation each time, and the author is just telling her to stop if she doesn't want feedback. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
