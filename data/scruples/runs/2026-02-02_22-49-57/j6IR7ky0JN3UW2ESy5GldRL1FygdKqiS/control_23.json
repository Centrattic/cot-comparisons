Weight doesn't matter in our sport. We have a wide variety of body types, from itty bitty pixies to tall, buff Amazons. One teammate, let's call her Joanne, has a pretty similar body to mine: slim with muscular legs and, because we're 18-22 year old women, there's a lot of insecurity about the way we look.\n\nWhile we were at practice one day, Joanne was looking at herself in the mirror, poking at her belly and frowning.\n\nJoanne: I'm so fat.\n\nMe: No you aren't! You look great.\n\nJoanne: That's nice of you to say, but it only matters what I think.\n\nJoanne pulls the same thing on two more teammates at different points in the day, fishing for a compliment, then saying that it doesn't matter. After she tells the third person that their opinion doesn't matter, I say, \"If you don't want our opinions, maybe don't talk about it around us.\" She gave me a look (kind of offended) and said \"Well I was just saying...\"\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their teammate to stop talking about her weight. The background is that the author is on a college sports team where weight isn't a factor. Their teammate, Joanne, keeps making negative comments about her body, seeking compliments but then dismissing others' opinions. The author finally tells her to stop if she doesn't want feedback.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The team has diverse body types, and weight isn't important for their sport. Joanne's behavior seems to be about her own insecurities. The author tried to compliment her, but she dismissed it. The author's response was to set a boundary by telling her not to talk about it if she doesn't want opinions.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, setting boundaries around body talk is often encouraged because it can create a healthier environment. The author isn't attacking Joanne but is asking her to stop seeking validation in a way that's causing discomfort. The team setting matters too\u2014sports teams need a supportive atmosphere. If Joanne is repeatedly making negative self-comments, it might affect the team's morale. The author's approach is direct but seems reasonable. They're not criticizing her body but addressing the behavior of seeking reassurance and then dismissing others.\n\nHowever, maybe the author could have approached it differently. Like, maybe talking to Joanne privately first instead of in front of others. But the scenario says Joanne repeated the behavior with others, so the author's public response might be a last resort. The key here is intent. The author wants to stop the cycle of negative self-talk, which is a valid concern. Body positivity is important, and the author is trying to prevent others from engaging in it. So, the author's action is about creating a positive environment, which is justified. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
