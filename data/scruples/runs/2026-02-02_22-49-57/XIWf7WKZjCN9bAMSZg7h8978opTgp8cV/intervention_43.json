Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The author is a 18-year-old guy who refuses to date women who aren't virgins. He says he loses interest if they mention not being a virgin, but doesn't get angry or block them, just keeps his distance. The girls he's rejected have called him sexist and controlling, and he's wondering if they're right.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms and personal preferences. The author is stating his preference clearly, but the issue is whether that preference is problematic. There's a difference between personal preference and discrimination. It's one thing to say you don't want to date someone for a particular reason, but if that reason leads to judgment or shaming, that could be an issue. The author claims he has no bad feelings, just no romantic interest. However, the term \"slutshaming\" is brought up by the women he's rejected. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, many people argue that a person's sexual history is none of someone else's business and shouldn't affect their worth. The author's stance could be seen as sexist because it imposes a standard specifically on women, which is not reciprocated for men. This double standard is often criticized in discussions about gender equality. The author might be applying different criteria to women versus men, which could be considered controlling or discriminatory.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is just stating his preference. Legally and in terms of personal autonomy, he's allowed to have his own standards. However, the problem arises when his preferences are based on harmful stereotypes or when they cause emotional harm by making others feel judged. The key here is whether his actions are shaming others or just expressing his own desires without imposing on them.\n\nThe author says he doesn't have any bad feelings and is happy to remain friends. But the act of rejecting someone based on their sexual history can still be hurtful. Even if it's not malicious, the impact on others matters. The women feel shamed, which suggests that his actions are causing harm, even if unintended. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. If he's being honest about his preferences without pressuring anyone, he's within his rights. However, the way his preferences affect others and the potential for judgment and double standards could mean he's in the wrong. The fact that the women feel slut-shamed implies that his stance, while personal, contributes to a culture of shame around women's sexuality, which is often seen as problematic.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong because his preference, while his own, may uphold harmful stereotypes and contribute to slut-shaming, which is widely considered unacceptable.\n"
