Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. The author is an 18-year-old guy who says he can't date girls who aren't virgins. He's not angry or blocking them, just losing interest. The girls he's rejected are upset, calling him sexist, slutshaming, etc. The user wants to know if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics and social norms here. Virginity is a personal choice and varies by cultural and individual values. However, in modern times, many people argue that someone's sexual history shouldn't affect their worth or a potential partner's interest. The key issue is whether the author's preference is harmful or discriminatory.\n\nThe author isn't acting out of hatred or malice; he's just stating a personal preference. But the problem arises when this preference leads to judgment or exclusion. Even if he's not being overtly hostile, his behavior can still be considered slutshaming because he's devaluing women based on their sexual history. This can make the women feel judged, which is a form of shaming.\n\nAlso, the author's argument is that he's not interested in someone if they've had sex before. This might stem from his own beliefs or upbringing, but it's a common view that can be seen as controlling because it imposes a standard on others. It's important to note that everyone has different values, but enforcing such a standard on others can be considered disrespectful to those who don't share it.\n\nAnother angle is consent and autonomy. People have the right to make their own choices regarding their bodies and relationships. By rejecting someone based on their past, the author is essentially disrespecting their autonomy. Even if it's his personal preference, acting on it in a way that makes others feel ashamed is problematic.\n\nSo, while the author might not be in the wrong in a legal sense, socially and ethically, his stance likely contributes to a harmful environment. The answer would lean towards A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because his preference can be seen as slutshaming and discriminatory, even if it's not malicious. The women have a right to feel upset about being judged for their sexual history.\n"
