Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. The author is 18, a guy, and he states he won't date girls who aren't virgins. He mentions that when they talk about not being virgins, he loses interest. The girls he's rejected are upset, calling him sexist and slut-shaming.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author is stating a personal preference, but how does that affect others? He says he doesn't have bad feelings, just no romantic interest. But the issue might be about how his preference is perceived by others. \n\nSlut-shaming typically refers to criticizing someone for their sexual behavior, especially in a way that's judgmental or discriminatory. If the author is rejecting women based on their sexual history, that could be seen as slut-shaming, even if he doesn't express anger. It's about the judgment and the implication that their behavior makes them less desirable. \n\nThe author argues it's just his preference, but societal norms and ethics often look at whether such preferences are harmful. By rejecting women for their past experiences, he might be enforcing harmful stereotypes or stigma. Also, the term \"controlling\" might come into play if his stance is seen as trying to dictate others' behavior. \n\nHowever, the author isn't forcing anyone or making it a legal or social rule. He's just stating his own dating preferences. But even personal preferences can be problematic if they contribute to a culture of shame or discrimination. \n\nAnother angle is consent and autonomy. The women are free to have their experiences, and the author is free to choose his partners. But when his choice causes others to feel shamed or judged, does that cross a line? It might depend on how he expresses it. Since he's not being openly hostile, maybe it's more about his personal bias rather than active harm. \n\nBut the fact that he's causing distress and being called sexist suggests that others see it as a problem. It's possible that his preference is rooted in outdated or harmful views about women's worth being tied to their sexual history. \n\nSo, even though he's not doing anything illegal, the ethical question is whether his preference is respectful. The answer might be that he's not in the wrong if he's not imposing it on others, but the way it's affecting others' feelings and the labels they give him (sexist, controlling) might mean he is in the wrong from a social perspective.\n"
