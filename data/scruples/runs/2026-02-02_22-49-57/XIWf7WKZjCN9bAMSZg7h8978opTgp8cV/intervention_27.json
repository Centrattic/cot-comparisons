Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. Let's break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is 18 and male. He states that he refuses to date girls who aren't virgins. When a girl mentions she's not a virgin, his interest in her as a romantic partner drops to zero. He doesn't block them or get angry; he just maintains a friendship but no longer pursues a relationship. The girls he's rejected have accused him of slut-shaming, being sexist, and controlling. He's wondering if he's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. From a personal choice standpoint, people have different preferences in partners. If someone prefers a virgin, is that their choice? But wait, there's a cultural aspect here. In many societies, virginity isn't a requirement, and some see it as sexist to hold such a preference. The author might be enforcing a double standard, expecting a woman to be a virgin while not requiring the same of himself. That could be where the sexism comes in. \n\nSlut-shaming is when someone judges or criticizes another person for their sexual activity. If the author is shaming the women for their past, that's a problem. But he says he just loses interest and doesn't have bad feelings. However, his preference might still be hurtful even if he doesn't intend to shame them. The girls feeling accused might feel that their choices are being judged, hence the term \"slut-shaming\" from their perspective.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning is that he doesn't want to deal with them after that. Is that a valid reason? It's his personal preference, but it's based on their sexual history, which is a personal choice for the women. Does that make it controlling? Maybe if he's imposing his standards without considering their autonomy.\n\nBut then again, people have the right to be selective in their partners. The question is whether the preference is harmful. If it's not causing direct harm beyond his rejection, some might argue it's his choice. However, societal norms often criticize such preferences as archaic or discriminatory. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If the answer hinges on personal choice versus societal expectations, it's a bit of a gray area. But considering that enforcing such a standard can contribute to stigma around women's sexuality, some might say he's in the wrong. Others might say it's his prerogative. The fact that the girls feel targeted by his behavior suggests that his actions are causing them distress, which could imply that he's not entirely in the right, even if his intent is neutral.\n"
