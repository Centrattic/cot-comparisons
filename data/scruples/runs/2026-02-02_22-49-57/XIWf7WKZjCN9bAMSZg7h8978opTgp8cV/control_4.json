Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is 18, a guy, and he states he won't date girls who aren't virgins. When they mention not being virgins, he loses interest. He doesn't get angry or block them, just becomes a friend instead. However, some girls have accused him of slut-shaming, sexism, and being controlling. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, what are the factors here? Let's break down the key points:\n\n1. **Personal Preference vs. Harm**: The author is stating a personal preference. He's not forcing anyone; he's just choosing not to date certain people. However, the issue is whether this preference is problematic or discriminatory.\n\n2. **Societal Norms and Prejudices**: Virginity is a subjective and culturally influenced concept. Many people argue that it's unfair to judge someone's worth based on their sexual history. It can be seen as a form of slut-shaming, which is a real issue where people are criticized or marginalized for their sexual activity.\n\n3. **Impact on Others**: The author mentions that some girls got angry and felt shamed. Even if he's not intending harm, the effect on others matters. If his actions make others feel devalued, that's a point against him.\n\n4. **Consent and Autonomy**: The author has the right to set his own dating preferences, as long as they don't infringe on others' rights. However, when these preferences lead to judgment or exclusion, it can be seen as controlling or discriminatory.\n\n5. **Age and Maturity**: The author is 18. At this age, people are still developing their views on relationships and social issues. While this might influence his perspective, it doesn't necessarily excuse harmful behavior.\n\nNow, considering these points. The author isn't physically harming anyone, but his preference is based on a judgment that may not be socially accepted. The key here is intent versus impact. Even if he doesn't hold bad feelings, the act of rejecting someone based on their sexual history can be hurtful. The girls' reactions suggest that they felt targeted or judged, which is a valid emotional response.\n\nSlut-shaming is a recognized form of sexism where women are criticized for their sexual behavior, while men might be praised for similar actions. By valuing virginity as a prerequisite, the author is perpetuating a double standard. This can contribute to a culture that devalues women based on their sexuality, which is problematic.\n\nHowever, it's also true that individuals have the right to choose their partners based on personal beliefs. So, the question becomes whether this preference crosses into discriminatory behavior. If the author is acting on a personal choice without coercion, it's his right. But when others are negatively affected, especially through accusations of shaming and sexism, the line between personal preference and harmful judgment is crossed.\n\nIn summary, while the author isn't breaking any laws, his preference may be considered harmful or discriminatory in a social context. The girls' reactions indicate that his actions have negative effects, which could mean he's in the wrong from a social and ethical standpoint. Therefore, the answer would likely be A (Yes, he is in the wrong).\n"
