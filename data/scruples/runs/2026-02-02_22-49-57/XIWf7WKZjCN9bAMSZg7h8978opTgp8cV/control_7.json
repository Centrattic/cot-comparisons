Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is that an 18-year-old guy refuses to date girls who aren't virgins, and some girls are upset, calling him sexist and slut-shaming.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and social implications here. The author's preference is clear: he won't date non-virgins. But is this acceptable? Well, people have various preferences in partners, but this one is particularly controversial. Virginity isn't a choice in the same way other preferences might be. For instance, someone might prefer someone who smokes or doesn't, but that's their own choice. However, having had sex is a personal experience, not a lifestyle choice. So by rejecting based on that, the author is essentially judging someone's past sexual history, which can be seen as slut-shaming. \n\nSlut-shaming is generally considered harmful because it stigmatizes people for their sexual activities, which are personal and consensual. The author's rejection is based on a standard that isn't about the person's character or how they behave now. It's about something that happened in their past. That can make people feel judged and devalued, hence why the girls are upset. \n\nAlso, the author's reasoning that he just loses interest because he doesn't want to \"deal with them after that\" is a bit vague. What does that mean? It could imply he has negative stereotypes about people who are not virgins, which is a form of prejudice. Even if his intentions are not malicious, the effect is still harmful. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that people have the right to their preferences in partners. But when those preferences are based on outdated or harmful norms, like the value of a person's worth being tied to their sexual history, it's a problem. The key here is the impact on others. The girls feel shamed and controlled by his standards, which is a common reaction when someone is judged for their sexual choices. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is enforcing a standard that contributes to slut-shaming and perpetuates a harmful double standard. Even if he doesn't have bad feelings, the way he's applying this preference can be seen as sexist because it's about controlling or judging women's bodies and past actions. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
