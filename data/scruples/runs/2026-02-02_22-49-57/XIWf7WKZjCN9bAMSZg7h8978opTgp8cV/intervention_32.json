Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author is 18 years old and a guy. He states that he doesn't date girls who aren't virgins. If a girl mentions she's not a virgin, he loses all romantic interest, though he's still okay with being friends. Some of the girls he's rejected have accused him of slut-shaming and being sexist. He's asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider personal choice in relationships. People have the right to set their own boundaries and preferences. However, societal views on virginity can vary, and there's a lot of debate about whether such preferences are justified, especially when they lead to judgment or exclusion.\n\nSlut-shaming is a real issue where people, especially women, are judged or criticized for their sexual behavior. If the author's rejection is based on personal preference without malice, but it's causing others to feel shamed, that's a point to consider. However, the author claims he doesn't have bad feelings and is open to friendship.\n\nOn one hand, it's his choice who he dates. On the other hand, if his stance makes others feel shamed or judged, that could be problematic. The key here is whether his actions are harmful beyond just not dating someone. Since he's not blocking or being hostile, maybe the harm is more about the perception of the girls.\n\nBut there's a line between personal preference and contributing to negative societal norms. If he's not actively shaming them but just not finding them attractive for personal reasons, it's a preference. However, the term \"slut-shaming\" implies that his judgment is part of a broader societal issue. So even if he's not intentionally shaming, his preference might align with those harmful attitudes.\n\nAlso, at 18, he's still forming his views, and this is a common topic of discussion in relationships. The question is whether his stance is objectively wrong or just a personal choice. Societal norms are shifting towards accepting people's sexual histories as personal choices, and stigma around non-virginity is being challenged. So if he's part of that stigma, even unintentionally, that could be the issue.\n\nIn conclusion, while he's entitled to his preferences, the act of rejecting someone based on their sexual history might be seen as contributing to a discriminatory attitude. However, if he's not actively shaming but just not interested, it's more about personal choice. The answer hinges on whether judgment is implied. Since the girls feel shamed and he's not denying that his preference might be perceived that way, it might be a case where his preference, though his right, is causing harm in perception. So the answer might be A (wrong) because it reinforces harmful stereotypes, but some might argue B (not wrong) because it's his choice.\n"
