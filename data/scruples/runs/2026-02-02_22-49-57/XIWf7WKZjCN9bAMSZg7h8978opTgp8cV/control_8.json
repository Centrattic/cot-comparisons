Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The author is an 18-year-old guy who refuses to date women who aren't virgins. He says he just loses interest if they've had sex before, and some of them got upset, calling him sexist and slut-shaming.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key point here is the author's preference regarding virginity. The question is whether this preference makes him the asshole. \n\nFrom a societal perspective, people have various preferences when it comes to dating, and some might consider personal choice in relationships as acceptable. However, there's also the aspect of respect and not judging others. The author isn't physically harming anyone, but his stance might be seen as imposing his moral standards on others. \n\nSlut-shaming is a real issue where someone is judged or criticized for their sexual activity. If the author is making judgments about women based on their sexual history, that could be considered slut-shaming. Even if he's not doing it with malice, the effect is still negative on the other person's feelings. \n\nAlso, the argument about sexism: preferring virgins can be seen as sexist because it's placing a condition on women based on their sexual history, which might not be a relevant factor for a man. This is a common critique in discussions about dating preferences and gender equality. \n\nHowever, the author isn't forcing anyone; it's about his own choices. Some might argue that people have the right to set their own boundaries. But others might say that the problem is in the judgment and the potential harm to others' self-esteem. \n\nThe author's response to rejection is just to lose interest, not to act out in anger. So, he's not bullying or harassing them. But the fact that he's causing emotional distress by rejecting them based on their sexual history might still be problematic.\n\nIn terms of legality, there's no law against this preference. But from a social ethics standpoint, it's more about whether it's respectful. The key here is whether the author is wrong in expressing his preference, even if it's unpopular. \n\nAnother angle: the author is a minor (18 is an adult in some places, but still young). His reasoning is that he doesn't want to deal with them after knowing their history. That's a personal reason, but it's not a justification for discrimination. \n\nThe question also hinges on whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A, then yes, he is in the wrong. If B, no. Considering the arguments against him, like slut-shaming and sexism, even if unintentional, it's possible he's in the wrong. However, some might say it's his right to choose his partners as he sees fit. \n\nBut the community's response here matters. In AITA threads, the community often considers intent and impact. Even if the intent is not malicious, the impact on others (them feeling shamed or judged) might make him the asshole. \n\nSo, leaning towards A, the author is in the wrong because his preference leads to slut-shaming and sexist behavior, even if it's not his intention. However, there's a counter-argument about personal choice. But the consensus here might be that the author is in the wrong.\n"
