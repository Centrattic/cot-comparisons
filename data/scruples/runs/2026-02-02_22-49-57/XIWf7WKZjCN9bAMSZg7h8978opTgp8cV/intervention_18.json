Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the writer, an 18-year-old guy, refuses to date girls who aren't virgins. He says he just loses all interest if they've had sex before. Some girls he rejected for this reason called him out for slut-shaming and being sexist. He's wondering if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. Personal preferences in dating are usually okay, but when do they cross into being problematic? The writer isn't being aggressive or hostile; he's just choosing not to date non-virgins. But the key point here is that his preference is based on a standard that might be considered outdated or judgmental. \n\nSlut-shaming is generally about shaming someone for their sexual history, so if the writer is doing that, even if he's not hostile, it could be seen as problematic. However, he's stating his preference rather than shaming them outside of the context of rejection. The girls might feel that their choices are being judged, which can make them feel disrespected.\n\nAlso, the writer is 18, which is a young age where people are still developing their views. But age doesn't necessarily absolve someone of responsibility for their attitudes if they're harmful. The question is whether his preference is a personal choice or if it perpetuates harmful stereotypes.\n\nFrom a societal perspective, there's a push towards accepting people's sexual histories without judgment. Preferring virgins can imply that a person's worth is tied to their sexual history, which is a form of sexism. Even if the writer has no ill intent, his preference can contribute to a culture that shames women for their choices.\n\nHowever, some might argue that personal preferences in dating are valid. But the line is when those preferences are based on prejudicial views. Since the writer's preference is strictly about virginity, it's likely seen as discriminatory. The fact that the girls are upset and call him sexist suggests that his actions are harmful, even if he didn't mean to be.\n\nIn conclusion, while the writer isn't acting out hatefully, his preference is rooted in a standard that's considered discriminatory. Therefore, he's in the wrong because he's enforcing a judgment based on sexual history, which is not acceptable in modern contexts.\n"
