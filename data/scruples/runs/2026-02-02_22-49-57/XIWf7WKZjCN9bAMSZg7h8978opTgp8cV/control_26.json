Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The author is an 18-year-old guy who refuses to date women who aren't virgins. He distances himself from them if they mention not being a virgin, but doesn't block them. Some girls have accused him of slut-shaming and being sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social and ethical implications here. The author's preference is clear, but is it wrong? Well, personal preference in dating is generally a free choice. However, there's a line when it comes to respecting others and not perpetuating harmful stereotypes. Virginity is a personal choice and a personal history, not a moral standard. By rejecting someone based on their past sexual experiences, the author might be enforcing traditional or conservative values that don't consider individual autonomy.\n\nSlut-shaming is a real issue where people judge others for their sexual activities. If the author is making women feel ashamed or judged for their past, even if he doesn't intend to, it's problematic. Also, the idea that a woman's value is tied to her virginity is sexist because it implies they should be pure for a man, which is a patriarchal view.\n\nBut the author isn't forcing anyone or being violent. He's just stating his preference. However, preferences don't become acceptable when they cause harm or perpetuate discrimination. The key is whether his actions contribute to a harmful environment. By rejecting women for their past, he might be contributing to the stigma that makes women feel they need to be virgins to be worthy of love, which can be hurtful.\n\nOn the other hand, he's not directly harming them beyond losing interest. But the perception matters here. The women felt hurt and accused him of being sexist, which suggests that his actions do have a negative impact. Even if he doesn't mean to, the effect is there. Also, considering that he's 18 and still forming his views, there's room to question if he's aware of how his stance can be seen as discriminatory.\n\nIn terms of consent and personal choice, the author is making a choice about who he dates. But when that choice is based on a woman's past, it's more about her history than her current self. This can be seen as objectifying, as it reduces their worth based on something that's part of their past and not relevant to their current character.\n\nIn conclusion, while it's his right to have preferences, the way he's imposing them can be considered sexist and harmful. The fact that the women felt shamed and angry indicates that his behavior crosses into problematic territory. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
