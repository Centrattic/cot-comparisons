I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The scenario is that an 18-year-old guy refuses to date women who aren't virgins, leading to some backlash from the women involved.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the core issue here. The author is being accused of slut-shaming and sexism. Let's break down the key points. The author states that he has no bad feelings towards these women but loses interest once he finds out they aren't virgins. He doesn't block them or get angry, just maintains a friendship. The women, however, feel shamed and called him sexist and controlling.\n\nSo, the main ethical questions here are: Is it wrong to have personal preferences that exclude people from dating you based on their sexual history? And, does this preference constitute slut-shaming or sexism?\n\nPersonal preferences in dating are generally a personal matter. People have various criteria for potential partners, and as long as they aren't harming others, it's often considered their right to have those preferences. However, the line blurs when these preferences are based on harmful stereotypes or discriminatory beliefs. \n\nSlut-shaming typically refers to making moral judgments or criticisms about someone's sexual behavior, often implying that having sex outside of marriage is wrong. If the author is not criticizing the women's choices but simply stating he's not interested, it might not be slut-shaming. However, by implying that his preference is about controlling others' behavior or enforcing a moral standard, he might be contributing to a judgmental environment.\n\nSexism in this context could come into play if the preference is rooted in gender stereotypes, such as the idea that women should be pure or that their sexual history affects their worth. If the author's stance is based on such stereotypes, it could be considered sexist because it imposes different standards on women than on men. For instance, if the author doesn't hold the same expectation for men, that would be sexist. The post doesn't mention his stance on men's sexual history, but the fact that he's focusing on women's virginity while not mentioning similar expectations for men suggests a double standard.\n\nControl is another aspect. If the author is pressuring women to conform to his standards or making them feel judged, that could be controlling. However, since he's not interacting further and is maintaining a respectful distance, it's more about his personal choice rather than active control. \n\nThe women's reactions are also important. They feel shamed, which indicates that their experience is negative. Even if the author doesn't intend to shame, the effect can still be harmful. The key here is intent versus impact. While intent matters, the impact on others' feelings and self-esteem is significant. \n\nFrom a societal perspective, promoting the idea that virginity is a prerequisite for dating can perpetuate harmful norms. It might contribute to stigma around women's sexuality and reinforce the notion that women's value is tied to their sexual history. This is problematic because it doesn't respect women's autonomy over their bodies and relationships.\n\nHowever, the author is 18 and might not be aware of the broader implications of his views. At that age, people are still forming their beliefs, and it's possible he hasn't considered the deeper societal issues. That said, being 18 doesn't absolve him from responsibility if his actions are causing harm or contributing to negative stereotypes.\n\nIn conclusion, while having personal preferences is acceptable, the author's stance could be seen as wrong because it perpetuates gender stereotypes and potentially harms others' self-esteem. The key factors are the double standard (if any), the impact on women's feelings, and the reinforcement of harmful societal norms. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
