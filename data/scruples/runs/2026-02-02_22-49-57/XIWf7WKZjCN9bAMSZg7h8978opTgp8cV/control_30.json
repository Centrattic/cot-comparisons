Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. The author is a guy who says he can't be interested in girls who aren't virgins. He doesn't block them but loses all romantic interest. The girls he's rejected say he's slut-shaming and being sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms and personal choice. The author has his own preferences, which is a personal matter. However, the issue is whether it's wrong to act on those preferences in a dating context. The key here is that personal preferences aren't inherently wrong. But when those preferences are based on outdated or harmful stereotypes, they can be problematic. \n\nSlut-shaming usually involves stigmatizing someone for their sexual activity, but in this case, the author is stating his criteria for dating, not criticizing others. However, the problem arises when such criteria are rooted in gender biases. For example, if a man had a different standard for women than for men, that could be sexist. The author isn't applying the same standard to himself, though. He's being clear about his own preferences without judging others' choices. \n\nBut the question is about whether he's in the wrong. The girls feel shamed, but the author isn't forcing them to accept his views. It's about mutual consent in dating. If someone's preferences are offensive, it's a problem, but the author isn't attacking them; he's just choosing not to pursue a relationship. However, there's a societal expectation that such preferences are outdated, especially regarding virginity. It's a personal choice, but if it's causing harm or perpetuating stigma, maybe it's considered wrong. \n\nI think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because his preference is based on a traditional view that may stigmatize women for their sexual history, which is seen as outdated and potentially sexist. Even if he's not hostile, the act of rejecting someone based on their sexual history can be seen as slut-shaming, especially if it's a blanket rule without exceptions. The fact that the girls feel shamed and call him sexist suggests that his actions are contributing to negative societal norms. So, the author's preference is his own, but acting on it in a way that's hurtful or based on harmful stereotypes makes him in the wrong.\n"
