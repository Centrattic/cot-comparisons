Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is that an 18-year-old guy refuses to date girls who aren't virgins. He says he loses all interest if they're not virgins and some girls have accused him of slut-shaming and being sexist. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms and values. In many modern societies, there's a push for equality and against prejudices. Judging someone based on their sexual history, especially in a way that discriminates against them, can be seen as prejudiced. Virginity is a personal choice and a personal history, not something that inherently affects a person's worth or suitability for a relationship. By rejecting someone solely based on that, he might be enforcing outdated or harmful stereotypes.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of personal preference. The author isn't forcing anyone; he's stating his own preferences. However, when these preferences lead to judgment or shaming, they can cross into problematic territory. The girls getting upset because he's rejecting them for their sexual history suggests that his actions are causing harm, even if he doesn't mean to. The term \"slut-shaming\" is about shaming someone for their sexual behavior, which he's doing by rejecting them for it.\n\nAnother angle is consent and respect. While he's not using force, his actions may be disrespectful by not accepting others' choices. The key here is whether his preference is causing harm. Since he's not engaging in negative behavior like harassment, but rather just choosing not to date them, it's a bit of a grey area. However, the fact that it's causing emotional distress to others might place the responsibility on him to reconsider his stance.\n\nAlso, considering the age, at 18, he's likely still forming his views. But that doesn't excuse harmful behavior. It's important to encourage empathy and understanding. His reasoning is that he \"doesn't want to deal with them after that,\" which sounds like a personal discomfort rather than a valid reason for rejection based on someone else's choice.\n\nIn summary, while it's his right to have personal preferences, acting on them in a way that judges or shames others for their sexual history can be considered wrong. The key is the impact of his actions on others and the perpetuation of negative stereotypes. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
