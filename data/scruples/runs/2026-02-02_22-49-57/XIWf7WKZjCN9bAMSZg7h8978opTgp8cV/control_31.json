Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. The writer is 18, male, and states he loses interest in girls who aren't virgins. He doesn't actively block them but just stops engaging romantically, which some girls have taken offense to, calling him sexist, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The writer is being honest about his preferences, but is that discrimination? If someone has a specific preference in a partner, is that their right, or is it imposing on others? In the US, for example, there's a concept of freedom of association, so he can choose who he dates. However, societal norms and values come into play. The term \"slutshaming\" is often used when someone is judged harshly for their sexual history. \n\nThe key point here is whether the writer's preference is his personal choice or if it's harmful. Since he's not forcing others, just choosing not to date them, it's his personal preference. However, the criticism from the girls he's rejecting might be valid because his preference could be seen as perpetuating stigma around women's sexual history. That could be considered sexist because it implies a double standard\u2014men might not be judged the same way for their sexual history.\n\nAnother angle is that the writer is being honest, which is important in relationships. If a woman isn't a virgin and finds out a potential partner can't accept that, it's better to know early on. But the issue arises when his preference is framed as a moral judgment rather than a personal choice. The girls who get upset might feel judged, not just rejected.\n\nAlso, the writer's age (18) is relevant. At that age, people are still developing their views on relationships and societal norms. His reasoning is \"I don't want to deal with them after that,\" which might indicate discomfort or lack of maturity in understanding others' experiences.\n\nIn conclusion, while the writer isn't legally or necessarily morally wrong for having this preference, the way it's presented and the effect on others might make him wrong in the eyes of those who value equality and non-judgment. The girls' reactions are about being shamed, which is a valid concern. So, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because his preference can be seen as perpetuating harmful stereotypes and judging others based on their sexual history, which is a form of slut-shaming and sexist behavior.\n"
