Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if someone is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. The author is 18, male, and says he won't date girls who aren't virgins. He claims he doesn't have ill feelings, just loses interest. The girls he rejects accuse him of slut-shaming, sexism, etc. The user initially thinks the author isn't wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The author's preference is based on virginity, which is a personal choice, but societal norms have changed a lot. Virginity isn't a standard many people use nowadays. The question is whether his preference is wrong.\n\nSlut-shaming is about moral judgment and shaming someone for their sexuality. If the author is dismissing people for their past sexual experiences, that could be seen as slut-shaming. Even if he's not mean about it, the act of rejecting someone based on their sexual history can be considered judgmental.\n\nThen there's the aspect of consent and autonomy. People should be free to make their own choices about their bodies and relationships. The author's stance might be seen as imposing his values on others, which others might find controlling or sexist. He's not physically harming anyone, but the rejection is a form of discrimination based on personal beliefs.\n\nHowever, personal preferences in dating are often subjective. If someone doesn't want to date someone with a certain background, it's their prerogative. But when those preferences are based on outdated or discriminatory views, they can be problematic. The key is whether the author is respecting the other person's autonomy without shaming them.\n\nThe author says he's okay with being friends, but the issue arises when it comes to romantic interest. The problem might be that his preference is rooted in assumptions about people's worth based on their sexual history, which can be considered sexist. It's also possible that this preference could lead to objectifying others rather than seeing them as individuals.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author isn't breaking any laws, his preference could be seen as discriminatory because it's based on a moral judgment of others' personal lives. The girls' reactions about being shamed might be valid because his rejection, even if polite, enforces a standard that isn't universally accepted and can be hurtful. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for perpetuating harmful attitudes, even if his intent isn't malicious.\n"
