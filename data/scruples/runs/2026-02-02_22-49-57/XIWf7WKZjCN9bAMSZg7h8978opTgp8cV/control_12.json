Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. So the guy is 18, male, and he only wants to date girls who are virgins. If a girl isn't a virgin, he loses all interest. Some of the girls he's rejected are upset, calling him sexist, slut-shaming, etc. He's not angry or blocking them, just keeping distance and being friends.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and social norms here. In many societies, personal preferences in dating are generally accepted as long as they don't harm others. However, there's a difference between a personal preference and imposing societal standards. The key issue here is whether his preference is harmful or discriminatory.\n\nSlut-shaming typically involves judgment or criticism of someone's sexual behavior, often based on gender stereotypes. If the guy is holding women to a standard that he doesn't apply to himself or others, that could be problematic. Since he's a guy and he's specifically rejecting girls based on their virginity status, this might reflect traditional gender roles that expect women to be sexually pure but not men. That could be seen as sexist because it upholds double standards.\n\nAnother angle is autonomy. People should have the right to set their own boundaries in dating. If he's not pressuring the girls or making them feel bad beyond his own disinterest, it's his choice to date only virgins. However, the problem arises when others feel shamed or judged for their choices. The girls' reactions suggest that they feel targeted or devalued, which complicates things.\n\nAlso, considering the age\u201418 years old\u2014maybe his views are shaped by his upbringing, religious beliefs, or lack of exposure to diverse perspectives. But even so, if his preference is causing distress to others, it's worth reflecting on whether it's appropriate.\n\nIn terms of legality, there's no law against having such preferences. But socially, there's a movement towards equality and challenging traditional gender roles. His stance could be seen as reinforcing harmful stereotypes that women should be pure, which is out of step with modern values promoting mutual respect and choice for all genders.\n\nHowever, the user might argue that it's his right to choose who he dates. But when such choices contribute to a culture that shames women for their sexual history, it's not just about personal preference. It's about the broader impact on others' self-esteem and the perpetuation of inequality.\n\nSo weighing these factors, the guy's preference is his personal choice, but the way it's affecting others and the underlying gender bias likely make him in the wrong. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
