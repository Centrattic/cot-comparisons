Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. The author is a guy who says he loses all romantic interest in girls who aren't virgins. He doesn't block them or get angry, just keeps his distance and remains friends. The girls he's rejected have accused him of slut-shaming, sexism, and control. The user thinks the author isn't wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and social aspects. Personal preferences in dating are generally allowed, but where's the line? The author isn't forcing anyone; he's just stating his own criteria. However, some might argue that this is a form of discrimination based on sexual history, which can be seen as judgmental and potentially harmful. The key here is intent versus impact. The author claims he has no bad feelings, just a lack of interest. But even if his intent is neutral, the impact on others could still be negative. \n\nSlut-shaming is a real issue where people are judged based on their sexual activity, often leading to stigma. The author's stance could contribute to that stigma by devaluing people who don't meet his criteria. However, others might say that personal preferences are valid as long as they're not imposed on others. The author isn't trying to control the girls' behavior but is choosing who he wants to date. \n\nBut then again, societal norms have shifted towards more acceptance and understanding. Expecting a partner to be a virgin can stem from outdated views on female purity and control over female sexuality. This might be seen as sexist because it imposes specific expectations on women that men aren't typically held to. \n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't forcing anyone; he's just declining to date people who don't meet his standards. So it could be a matter of personal choice rather than being in the wrong. However, the problem arises if his actions contribute to a culture of judgment or if he's using his preferences to invalidate others' choices. \n\nI need to balance between respecting personal choice and acknowledging the potential harm of such preferences. Since the author isn't engaging in harassment or discrimination beyond his own decisions, he might not be in the wrong. But the way others perceive it as slut-shaming suggests that there's a societal issue with such standards. \n\nIn conclusion, it's a nuanced situation. The author's actions are his own choice, but the societal context and potential harm to others' feelings could mean he's not entirely without fault. But if the question is about whether he's \"in the wrong\" in a strict sense, it's about his right to have personal preferences versus the impact on others. Since he's not harming others directly, maybe the answer is B, but there's a lot of gray area.\n"
