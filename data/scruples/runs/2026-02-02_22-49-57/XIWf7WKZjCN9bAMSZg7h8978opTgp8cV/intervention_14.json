Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for only dating virgins. The author is 18, male, and says he loses all romantic interest if a girl isn't a virgin. Some girls took offense, calling him sexist and slut-shaming.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and social norms. In some cultures, virginity is still a big deal for men when choosing partners. But in many modern contexts, that's seen as outdated or even discriminatory. The key here is that the author is making a personal choice, but others are interpreting it as judgmental.\n\nSlut-shaming typically refers to shaming someone for their sexual activity. The author isn't shaming them; he's just stating his preference. However, the line between personal preference and judgment can be thin. By rejecting people based on their sexual history, he might be seen as imposing his values on others, which could be considered controlling or sexist, even if he doesn't intend to be.\n\nAlso, the fact that he's 18 and possibly still developing his views is a factor. At that age, people can have strong opinions that may shift as they mature. But that doesn't make his current stance right or wrong\u2014just part of his current perspective.\n\nAnother angle: everyone has the right to set their own relationship criteria. But when those criteria are based on factors beyond someone's control (like past relationships) and could be seen as discriminatory, it's debatable. The author's reasoning is personal preference, but if it leads others to feel judged or excluded, especially when his behavior is framed as slut-shaming, that could be problematic.\n\nThe key is whether the author's actions are harmful. He says he doesn't block or get mad, just lose interest. So he's not actively harming them, but his stance might contribute to a culture where people feel pressured to conform to certain standards. That could be seen as wrong because it perpetuates stigma, even if unintentionally.\n\nSo, while the author is expressing his preference, the fact that others perceive this as sexist or shaming suggests that his stance is at least questionable. It's a matter of whether personal choice overrides the potential for causing offense. I think in most modern contexts, the author would be considered in the wrong because his preference is based on a subjective standard that others find discriminatory. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
