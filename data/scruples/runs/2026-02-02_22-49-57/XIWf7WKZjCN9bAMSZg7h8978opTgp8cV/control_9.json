Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong because they refuse to date non-virgins.\n\nFirst, the author is 18 and male. He states he won't date girls who aren't virgins, and when they mention not being virgins, he loses interest. He doesn't act aggressively, just distances himself. The girls he rejects are upset, calling him sexist and slut-shaming. He claims he doesn't have bad feelings, just no romantic interest after knowing they're not virgins.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. From a standpoint of personal choice, people have the right to set their own dating preferences. However, societal norms and ethical considerations come into play. Virginity isn't a standard that's applied equally to men and women, so this could be seen as sexist. The author is applying a double standard if he doesn't hold the same expectation for himself. Additionally, the term \"slut-shaming\" implies that he's making moral judgments about women's sexual history, which is generally considered problematic because it's a form of shaming based on personal choices that don't harm others.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) Is it acceptable to judge someone's romantic eligibility based on their sexual history? 2) Does this preference stem from sexist attitudes? 3) Is the author's behavior considered controlling or discriminatory?\n\nIn many modern perspectives, shaming someone for their sexual history is frowned upon. It's a personal choice, and while the author is entitled to his preferences, the way he's enforcing them by losing all interest could be seen as judgmental and sexist. Also, the fact that the women are upset and feel shamed suggests that his actions have a negative impact on others, which might make him at least partially responsible for their hurt feelings.\n\nHowever, some might argue that it's his prerogative to choose his partners based on personal standards. But the problem arises when those standards perpetuate harmful stereotypes or inequalities. Since virgins are a minority in the dating pool, this preference could be seen as exclusionary without valid justification beyond personal bias.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong (A) because his preference likely contributes to slut-shaming and enforces a double standard, which is ethically questionable.\n"
