Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. The author is an 18-year-old guy who says he loses all romantic interest in girls who aren't virgins. Some girls have accused him of slut-shaming and being sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the societal norms and perspectives on this issue. In many modern contexts, virginity isn't considered a requirement for relationships, and people often view it as a personal choice. The author's preference might be seen as outdated or discriminatory. However, personal preferences in dating can be subjective. But the key here is whether his preference is harmful or offensive.\n\nThe author doesn't act out of malice; he just loses interest. He doesn't block or get angry, which shows he's not being hostile. But others might see his stance as judgmental. The term \"slut-shaming\" implies shaming someone for their sexual activity, which the author might be doing unconsciously. Even if he has no bad feelings, his actions can still be hurtful or perpetuate stigma.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, while it's his right to have preferences, when those preferences are based on someone's past actions and lead to judgment, it can be seen as wrong. The fact that others feel accused and offended suggests his actions aren't neutral. Also, considering gender dynamics, holding such a preference might contribute to controlling or sexist attitudes, even if unintended.\n\nOn the other hand, he's 18 and might still be forming his views. However, the question is about whether he's in the wrong now. The consensus in many places is that virginity shouldn't affect someone's worth or another person's decision to date them. So, while he's not physically harming anyone, the judgment aspect could be problematic.\n\nI think the answer leans towards A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because his preference, though personal, can be hurtful and perpetuate negative stereotypes. But there's a nuance here. However, in the context of the question, the majority opinion would likely side with the girls who feel shamed. So, AITA would probably say he's in the wrong.\n"
