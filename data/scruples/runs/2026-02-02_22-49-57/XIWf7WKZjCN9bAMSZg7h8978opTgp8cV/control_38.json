Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. The author is 18, male, and states that he loses all romantic interest if a girl isn't a virgin. Other people have accused him of slut-shaming and being sexist. The user wants a yes or no answer based on whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms and values. In many modern societies, there's a strong emphasis on personal choice and equality in relationships. Virginity is a personal choice and doesn't define a person's worth. By rejecting someone based on their sexual history, the author is making a judgment about their value as a romantic partner, which can be seen as sexist because it imposes a standard that doesn't apply equally to men. The user mentions that he's okay being friends, but the issue is about romantic interest. \n\nSlut-shaming is a real problem where people, especially women, are criticized for their sexual activity. By rejecting women based on this, the author could be contributing to that culture. Even if he doesn't have bad feelings, the impact of his actions on others is significant. The women feeling \"pissed\" and calling him sexist suggests that his actions are hurtful and discriminatory. \n\nAlso, the reasoning that romantic interest \"evaporates\" due to someone's past relationships isn't a valid basis for rejection. It's a form of prejudice. Healthy relationships are about mutual respect and compatibility, not past actions. The author's stance might also be rooted in outdated gender norms that don't consider women's autonomy over their bodies and choices. \n\nHowever, some might argue that personal preferences in relationships are subjective. But when those preferences are based on irrelevant or discriminatory criteria, they cross into being problematic. The key here is that the author is applying a standard that's not reciprocal and is harming others' feelings and self-esteem. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions are likely considered wrong because they perpetuate sexism and judgment based on personal choices. The correct answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
