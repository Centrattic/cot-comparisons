Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about rejecting non-virgins. The author is an 18-year-old guy who says he won't date girls who aren't virgins. He mentions that when a girl he's interested in says she's not a virgin, he loses interest and keeps his distance. Some of these girls got angry, calling him a slutshamer and sexist. He doesn't have bad feelings, just no romantic interest anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if this is a valid question about personal preferences versus harmful behavior. The key points here are the author's personal preference versus the impact on others. The author isn't doing anything illegal, but the question is about whether his actions are morally or socially wrong.\n\nSlut-shaming is about stigmatizing someone for their sexual history, especially women. The author's stance could be seen as slut-shaming because he's using a girl's sexual history as a reason to reject her romantically. Even if he's not hostile, the fact that he's applying a standard that's often used to shame women might make him wrong. Also, the argument that he's being sexist because he's applying this standard only to women (he doesn't mention similar expectations for himself) could be valid. \n\nOn the other hand, he's stating his preference. People have the right to be selective in their relationships. However, when such preferences lead to judgment or discrimination, it crosses into problematic territory. The girls are upset because their choices are being judged, which can be hurtful. Even if the author isn't malicious, the effect of his actions is negative. \n\nThe author isn't controlling others, but his rejection based on their sexual history could be seen as controlling by dictating their worth in his eyes. The key here is whether his preference is harmful. Since it's contributing to stigma and making others feel shamed, it's likely that he's in the wrong. \n\nAlso, at 18, societal expectations might be evolving, and such views could be considered outdated or discriminatory. The answer would hinge on whether personal preference justifies the potential harm to others' feelings and self-esteem. So, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
