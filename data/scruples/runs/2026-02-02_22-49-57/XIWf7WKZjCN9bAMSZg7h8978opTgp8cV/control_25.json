Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down.\n\nThe author is a guy who says he won't date girls who aren't virgins. He mentions that when a girl he's interested in isn't a virgin, he loses all interest and keeps his distance. He doesn't block them or get angry, but some of these girls have accused him of slut-shaming, being sexist, and controlling. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what slut-shaming means. It's when someone judges or criticizes others for their sexual activity, often by calling them names like \"slut\" or \"whore,\" or by devaluing them based on their sexual history. The author is rejecting people based on their sexual history, which could be seen as a form of slut-shaming. But he's not using derogatory terms, just stating a preference.\n\nThen there's the aspect of sexism. If the author's preference is based on outdated ideas about women's purity or control over their sexuality, that could be sexist. For example, the idea that a woman's value in a relationship is tied to her virginity is a traditional sexist notion. Men aren't typically judged by their sexual history in the same way, so applying such a standard to women but not to men could be sexist.\n\nAlso, the author says he doesn't have bad feelings, just no romantic interest. But the fact that he's making a judgment based on a personal preference that others find discriminatory might be the issue. Even if it's his personal choice, the way it affects others and the societal norms around it matter.\n\nHowever, some might argue that it's his right to have personal preferences in dating. If he's not forcing others or being abusive, maybe it's not entirely his fault. But the problem arises when his preferences lead to shaming or exclusion based on something that's personal and not a reflection of the person's worth.\n\nThe key here is whether his actions contribute to harmful stereotypes or discrimination. By valuing virginity as a requirement for a relationship, he's upholding the idea that a person's sexual history defines their suitability for love, which can be harmful. The fact that the rejected girls feel shamed and accuse him of being sexist suggests that his actions, while perhaps not malicious, are still contributing to negative social dynamics.\n\nSo putting it all together, even if the author doesn't have ill intentions, his preference is based on a standard that many consider outdated and discriminatory. Therefore, he might be in the wrong because his actions perpetuate harmful attitudes, even if they're his personal choices.\n"
