Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is 18 and male, and he states he won't date women who aren't virgins. He mentions that when a girl he's interested in isn't a virgin, his romantic interest vanishes. The key points here are his personal preference and the reactions he gets from others. The girls he's rejected accuse him of slut-shaming, being sexist, and controlling.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and the evolution of dating values, there's a lot of emphasis on mutual respect and consent in modern relationships. The author's stance is about a personal preference, but when it comes to dating, people often have specific criteria. The problem arises when those criteria are based on outdated or discriminatory beliefs. \n\nVirginity is a personal choice, and while some people may have reasons for valuing it (religious, personal, etc.), there's a line between having a preference and enforcing it on others. The author isn't forcing others; he's choosing not to date based on that. However, the issue is that this preference might be based on stereotypes or societal expectations rather than the individual's character. \n\nThe term \"slut-shaming\" is used when someone judges another for being sexually active. If the author's rejection is based on the number of partners rather than mutual respect, that could be seen as slut-shaming. It's also important to note that everyone's sexual history is their own, and it doesn't define their worth. \n\nThe author claims he has no bad feelings and just loses interest, but the effect on the other person is that they feel judged. Even if it's not intentional, the impact matters. Being labeled as sexist or controlling suggests that his preference is seen as a form of control over others' bodies. \n\nIn a broader context, promoting sexual freedom and autonomy is a key part of modern relationships. While it's okay to have preferences, they shouldn't be rooted in judgment or discrimination. The author's stance might be a personal choice, but acting on it in a way that others perceive as harmful could place him in the wrong. \n\nI should also consider that at 18, the author might be forming his views and might not fully grasp the implications of his preferences. However, the question is about whether he's in the wrong, not about his maturity. \n\nSo, weighing all this, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because his preference, while personal, can be seen as discriminatory and contributes to harmful stereotypes. But I need to make sure I'm not conflating personal preference with harmful behavior. The key is that by setting this as a deal-breaker, he's imposing his standards on others, which can be hurtful even if not violent.\n"
