Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. The author is 18, male, and states that he loses interest in girls who aren't virgins. The girls he's rejected are upset, calling him sexist and slut-shaming. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants another opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author isn't being hostile; he's just setting personal boundaries. He says he's fine with being friends but has no romantic interest if they've had sex. The key points here are personal preference versus discrimination. The author isn't forcing anyone to follow his views; he's just choosing who he dates based on his own criteria.\n\nBut then, there's the aspect of slut-shaming. That term usually refers to judging someone for their sexual activity, implying that it's immoral or wrong. If the author is judging the girls based on their past actions, that could be seen as slut-shaming. However, he's not shaming them publicly or making them feel bad beyond his own rejection. He's not blocking them or getting angry, just disengaging romantically.\n\nAlso, societal norms play a role here. The pressure on women regarding virginity is often more intense, and by making this a deal-breaker, the author might be reinforcing those harmful norms. But it's his choice in partners, so is it his right to have such preferences? On the other hand, by making it a strict rule, is he being controlling or sexist by holding women to a standard that's not applied to men?\n\nAnother angle is whether this preference is based on personal values or societal expectations. If it's the former, maybe it's his right to follow his values. But if it's societal, he might be perpetuating double standards. However, the question isn't about whether his preference is good, but whether he's in the wrong for having it.\n\nThe girls' reactions are valid because they feel judged. Even if the author isn't intending to shame, the effect is there. But the author isn't in the wrong if he's not violating any laws or explicit rights. It's a matter of personal choice in relationships. However, if it's contributing to a culture that shames others, it could be seen as problematic.\n\nI think the answer here is a balance. While the author isn't in the wrong for having his own preferences, it's important to recognize the potential for harm in enforcing such strict criteria. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's not actively harming others beyond his own choices, the answer leans towards B (No), but with the caveat that his actions might not be ideal.\n"
