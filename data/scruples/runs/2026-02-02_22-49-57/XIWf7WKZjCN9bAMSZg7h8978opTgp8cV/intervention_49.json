Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author is 18, male, and he states he won't date girls who aren't virgins. He loses interest if they've had sex before, but doesn't block or get mad, just keeps distance. Some girls have accused him of slut-shaming, sexism, and being controlling. The user initially thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nHmm, so the key points are about personal preferences vs. judgment. The author is stating his dating criteria, which is a personal choice. However, the issue arises when others feel shamed or judged because of his preference. The question is whether holding such a preference is wrong, especially when it's causing hurt feelings.\n\nI should consider societal norms. In many modern contexts, virginity isn't a common requirement for relationships, and some might view this preference as outdated or discriminatory. But others might argue it's about personal values. However, the term \"slut-shaming\" implies that the author is making moral judgments about women's sexual history, which can be problematic regardless of the intent.\n\nAlso, the author's justification is that he just has zero interest, which is a personal preference. But if his actions lead others to feel shamed or controlled, even if unintentionally, there's a case to be made that he's contributing to a negative environment. The line between personal preference and judgment can be blurry here.\n\nI need to think about whether it's ethical to have such a strict criterion. While he's not forcing anyone, the rejection based on a specific personal choice (sex before) might be seen as sexist if it's based on stereotypes about women's worth. On the other hand, everyone has the right to set their own boundaries in relationships.\n\nBut the problem is that his preference is causing others to feel attacked. Even if he doesn't intend to shame them, the effect is there. That complicates the issue. So, maybe the answer hinges on the impact of his actions versus his intentions.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's preference is his right, the way it's affecting others might place him in the wrong, especially if it's fostering a judgmental attitude. Therefore, leaning towards A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
