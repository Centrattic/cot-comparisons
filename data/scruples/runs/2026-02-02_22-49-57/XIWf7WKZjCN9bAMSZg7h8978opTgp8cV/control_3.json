Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is 18 and a guy, and he's asking if he's in the wrong for only wanting to date women who are virgins. He mentions that when girls he's interested in aren't virgins, he loses all romantic interest but remains friendly. The girls he's rejected have accused him of slut-shaming, sexism, and being controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms and values. Many people view virginity as a personal choice and not a requirement for dating. The idea that one's value is tied to their sexual history is often seen as judgmental. Slut-shaming is a real issue, where individuals, especially women, are criticized or ostracized for their sexual activity. The user's stance could be seen as contributing to that by making others feel judged based on their past relationships.\n\nNext, the user's justification is that he just feels no romantic interest if they've had sex before. He claims it's not about bad feelings but a lack of interest. However, this preference might stem from personal biases or societal conditioning. It's important to note that everyone has the right to set personal boundaries in relationships, but when those boundaries involve judging others based on their past, it can be problematic.\n\nSexism in this context could be about holding different standards for women versus men. If the user had the same standards for himself, that might be different, but the question is about his judgment towards women. The controlling aspect might be less direct here since he's not using force or pressure, but rather choosing not to date them, which is a form of social control by excluding based on personal standards.\n\nThe key points are: Is it okay to have personal preferences in dating? Yes, but when those preferences lead to shaming or discrimination, they cross a line. The user isn't physically harming anyone, but his behavior can emotionally affect others by making them feel devalued. The girls' reactions are valid because being judged for one's sexual history is a common experience, and such preferences can contribute to a culture of slut-shaming.\n\nIn terms of ethical considerations, respecting others' autonomy and choices is crucial. The user's preference might be his right, but the way it's enforced could be seen as judgmental. It's also possible that his views are influenced by traditional or conservative values that don't align with modern, inclusive perspectives.\n\nHowever, the user argues he's not being hostile, just choosing not to date them. This complicates things because intentions matter. If his intent is purely personal preference without malice, does that absolve him? Not entirely, because the impact on others is still significant. The line between personal choice and harmful behavior can be blurry here.\n\nIn conclusion, while the user has the right to set personal dating criteria, the social and ethical implications of his preference\u2014potentially contributing to slut-shaming and sexism\u2014suggest that he is in the wrong. The girls' reactions are understandable, and the user's stance lacks consideration for the societal context and the potential harm of his judgmental attitude.\n"
