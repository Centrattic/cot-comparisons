Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. The author is 18 and male, and he states that he loses all romantic interest in girls who aren't virgins. The girls he's rejected have accused him of slut-shaming, sexism, and being controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The author isn't doing anything harmful like blocking or being angry; he just stops pursuing relationships. The girls, however, feel offended and label his behavior as problematic. The core issue is whether having a preference for virgins is discriminatory or wrong.\n\nI should consider societal norms and values. In many modern contexts, virginity isn't seen as a requirement for a relationship. People often have diverse sexual histories, and judging someone based on that could be viewed as judgmental or prejudiced. The term \"slut-shaming\" refers to stigmatizing people for their sexual activity, so if the author is shaming others for their choices, that's a negative trait. However, the author claims it's just a personal preference, not an attempt to shame others.\n\nAnother angle is personal choice. The author is stating his own preferences, which he might not see as wrong. However, when these preferences affect others' feelings and lead to accusations of sexism, it's worth examining if his actions contribute to a controlling or sexist attitude. Sexism involves treating someone unfairly due to their gender, but in this case, it's more about sexual history, which might fall under a different category of judgment.\n\nAlso, considering the age of the author (18), he's still forming his views. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong now, not about his future growth. The fact that others feel shamed by his actions suggests that his preference might be insensitive, even if he doesn't intend to harm. The line between personal preference and discrimination can be blurry here.\n\nIn some cultures or religions, virginity is valued, so the author's stance might be rooted in those beliefs. However, the question doesn't mention any religious context, so it's likely a personal choice without such grounding. If the author is applying a standard that's not reciprocated (e.g., not considering his own sexual history for others), that could contribute to the perception of being controlling or sexist.\n\nUltimately, while the author isn't engaging in direct harm, his preference may perpetuate stigma around sexual activity, which is generally frowned upon in contemporary discussions around consent and personal freedom. The girls' reactions are valid because they feel judged for their choices, even if the author's intention is just a preference. So, the answer would lean towards the author being in the wrong because his preference affects others negatively and contributes to a judgmental attitude.\n"
