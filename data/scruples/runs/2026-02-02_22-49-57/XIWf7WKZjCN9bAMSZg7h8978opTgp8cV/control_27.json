Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. The author is an 18-year-old guy who says he loses all romantic interest in girls who aren't virgins or have had multiple partners. The girls he's rejected are upset, calling him sexist, controlling, and slut-shaming.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms and values. Virginity is a personal choice, but in many cultures, it's not considered a valid reason to judge someone's worth. The key point here is whether the author's actions are discriminatory. He's not being violent or abusive; he's just stating a personal preference. However, the fact that his preference leads to rejection based on someone's sexual history might be seen as judgmental or hypocritical if society generally supports sexual freedom and autonomy.\n\nSlut-shaming typically refers to shaming someone for their sexual activity, but here the author is the one making the judgment. The girls' reactions suggest they feel targeted. The author isn't forcing anyone; he's choosing not to date them, but the way he frames it as a loss of interest without explanation could come across as disrespectful. \n\nAlso, the author mentions he's okay with being friends, which might mitigate some blame. However, his preference is based on someone's past actions, which is a personal choice, but when it leads to exclusion in dating, it can be considered a form of bias. The girls' accusations of sexism and control might be valid if they feel their autonomy is being undermined. \n\nOn the other hand, people do have the right to set personal boundaries in relationships. If the author is honest and not pressuring others, some might argue it's his choice. But the problem arises when his preferences lead to shaming or discrimination. The term \"slut-shaming\" is usually directed at those who judge others for being sexually active, but the author's actions could be seen as the opposite extreme\u2014overvaluing virginity to the point of rejection. \n\nIn many modern contexts, virginity isn't a requirement for a relationship, and imposing such a standard can be seen as archaic or discriminatory. The author's reasoning that \"0% interest\" might be a personal bias without a justifiable reason. Therefore, even though he's not acting out of malice, his actions could be considered wrong because they perpetuate stigma and judgment around sexual history.\n"
