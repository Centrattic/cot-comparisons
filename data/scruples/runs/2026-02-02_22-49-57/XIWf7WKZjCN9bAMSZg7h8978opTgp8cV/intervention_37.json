Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. Let me start by breaking down the situation. The author is an 18-year-old guy who says he can't date girls who aren't virgins. If a girl mentions she's not a virgin, he loses all interest. He doesn't get angry or block them, just keeps his distance and remains friends. The girls he rejected are upset, calling him sexist and slut-shaming.\n\nFirst, I should consider what \"slut-shaming\" means. It typically refers to stigmatizing someone for their sexual activity, often implying that their behavior is immoral or that they deserve negative treatment. The author is rejecting potential partners based on their sexual history, which could be seen as a form of judgment. But he says he has no bad feelings and just isn't interested. That might be his defense.\n\nOn the other hand, personal preferences in dating are generally protected. People can have criteria for who they're interested in romantically. However, there's a line when those preferences become discriminatory or harmful. The key here is whether the author's preference is just a personal choice or if it's enforcing harmful stereotypes.\n\nThe author mentions that any romantic interest evaporates if the girl isn't a virgin. That seems like a strict boundary. But setting such a boundary might be problematic because it implies that virginity is a necessary condition for romantic interest, which can perpetuate traditional gender roles. It might also be considered controlling if he's imposing his standards on others without considering their autonomy.\n\nHowever, the author isn't forcing anyone to conform to his preferences; he's just choosing not to pursue relationships with those who don't meet his criteria. That's a personal choice. But the fact that the girls are upset and feel shamed is a reaction worth considering. The label of \"slut-shaming\" might be applied because he's judging them for their past actions beyond his control.\n\nAnother angle is whether this preference is based on respect or on a belief that virginity is inherently more valuable. If it's the latter, that could be seen as sexist. If it's about personal comfort and what he's looking for, it's a personal choice. But the problem arises when others are made to feel that their worth is diminished because they don't meet his standards.\n\nThe author's age (18) might be relevant. At that age, people are still developing their views on relationships and societal norms. However, age alone doesn't determine right or wrong. The key is the impact of his actions. Since he's not being aggressive or malicious, but others feel shamed, there's a conflict between personal preference and social responsibility.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author has the right to have personal preferences, the way his preference is framed and the reactions it causes might mean he's inadvertently contributing to slut-shaming. The girls' reactions might be valid if they feel judged, even if his intent is just to state his preferences. So, the answer could lean towards A, the author is in the wrong, because his preference perpetuates harmful judgments.\n"
