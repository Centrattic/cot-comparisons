Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for only dating girls who are virgins. The author is 18 and male, and he states that if a girl mentions not being a virgin, he loses all romantic interest. The girls he's rejected are upset, calling him sexist and slut-shaming. He doesn't block them or get angry, just distances himself and remains friends.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The key points are consent, respect, and discrimination. The author isn't forcing anyone; he's simply stating his preferences. However, virginity is a personal choice and varies across cultures and individuals. By only dating virgins, he's imposing a specific standard that may not be fair or respectful to others' autonomy. \n\nSlut-shaming is a real issue, where people are judged or stigmatized for their sexual history. If the author is making the girls feel bad about their past experiences, that's problematic. Even if he doesn't intend to shame them, his actions can still contribute to a stigma by devaluing people based on their sexual history. \n\nSexism comes into play if his preference is based on outdated notions that women's worth is tied to their sexual purity. This often stems from patriarchal values and can be discriminatory. The fact that he's applying this standard only to women (and not to himself or men in general) suggests a double standard, which is a form of sexism. \n\nOn the other hand, the author argues that it's his personal choice and he's not acting out of malice. He's open to maintaining friendships, so it's not about cutting off all contact. But the question is whether this preference is valid or if it's harmful. Personal preferences are okay as long as they don't harm others or enforce harmful stereotypes. \n\nThe girls feeling judged are valid in their reactions. If someone's personal choice leads others to feel devalued, that's an issue. The author's reasoning that he just doesn't want to deal with them after knowing their history might stem from personal discomfort, but it's a form of gatekeeping that can be controlling. \n\nSo, considering all these factors, I think the author's stance contributes to slut-shaming and sexism. Even if it's his preference, it's not respecting the other person's autonomy and can be hurtful. Therefore, he might be in the wrong.\n"
