Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is an 18-year-old guy who doesn't date girls who aren't virgins. He says he loses all interest if they've had sex before but still wants to be friends. The girls he's rejected are upset, calling him sexist and slut-shaming. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but they want my opinion. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong).\n\nI need to consider societal norms and personal beliefs here. The author is stating a preference, but the issue is whether that preference is discriminatory. In many modern contexts, virginity is a personal choice and not a valid reason to judge someone's worth. By rejecting people based on their sexual history, he's imposing his standards on others, which can be seen as controlling or sexist because it's about controlling their bodies and past actions. \n\nSlut-shaming is when someone judges or criticizes another for their perceived sexual behavior. The author's rejection could be seen as a form of that. However, he argues he has no negative feelings, just a loss of interest. But the problem here might be that his preference is based on a standard that isn't his to enforce. Also, it's important to recognize that virginity isn't a measure of someone's value or suitability for a relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, he's not forcing anyone; he's just choosing not to date them. It's about his own preferences. However, when these preferences lead to shaming or making others feel bad about their choices, it crosses into problematic territory. The key point is whether his actions are harmful. Since the girls feel shamed and upset, that indicates harm. \n\nIn terms of consent and autonomy, each person's sexual history is their own business. The author is making a judgment that affects their self-esteem and social interactions. Even if he's not hostile, the impact of his rejection can contribute to stigma. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because his preference leads to shaming and imposes his values on others, which is disrespectful of their autonomy. Even if it's his personal choice, the way it's affecting others makes it problematic.\n"
