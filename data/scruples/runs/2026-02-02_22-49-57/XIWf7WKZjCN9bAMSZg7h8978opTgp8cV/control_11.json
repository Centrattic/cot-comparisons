Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. Let me start by understanding the situation. The author is an 18-year-old guy who says he won't date girls who aren't virgins. He mentions that when girls mention they've had sex, his interest drops to zero, and he keeps his distance. The girls he's rejected have accused him of slut-shaming, being sexist, and controlling. He wants to know if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral and social implications here. The main issue is whether his preference is discriminatory. From a societal perspective, there's a lot of discussion about how virginity should not be a requirement for dating. Many people argue that it's a form of sexism because it places unrealistic and unfair expectations on women, judging them based on their sexual history rather than other qualities. Slut-shaming is a real problem, and by making a blanket rejection based on something as personal as past relationships, he might be contributing to that.\n\nOn the other hand, the author claims he has no ill will and is open to being friends. He's not blocking or being hostile, just losing interest. He might believe this is a personal choice and that he's within his rights to have such preferences. However, the key point is whether this preference is harmful or discriminatory. Even if it's a personal choice, if it's causing harm or perpetuating negative stereotypes, it could be considered wrong.\n\nAnother angle is that everyone has the right to set their own boundaries in relationships. But the question is whether those boundaries are based on prejudice. If someone rejects others for reasons that are biased or based on stereotypes, that's where the line is crossed. The author's stance seems to be a double standard, as it's rare for men to face similar scrutiny regarding their sexual history. This discrepancy can be seen as sexist because it enforces a standard that's not applied equally.\n\nAlso, considering the age\u201418 years old\u2014this person might be forming these views without much awareness of the broader social context. It's possible he hasn't considered the implications of his stance beyond his personal feelings. The girls he's rejected are reacting negatively because they feel judged and devalued, which is a valid emotional response.\n\nIn terms of ethics, respecting others' autonomy and not making judgments based on personal choices that don't harm anyone else is important. By rejecting someone solely based on their past sexual experiences, he's making a judgment that can affect their self-esteem and sense of worth. This could be seen as controlling, as it's imposing his standards on others without considering their own values or experiences.\n\nIn summary, while the author might not have malicious intent, his preference perpetuates harmful stereotypes and creates a discriminatory standard. Therefore, it's likely that he is in the wrong, so the answer would be A.\n"
