Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that he's 18, a guy, and he won't date girls who aren't virgins. He says he loses all interest if they've had sex before, but he's still friends with them. The girls he's rejected have called him sexist and slut-shaming, and he's asking if they're right.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms and values. Virginity as a requirement for dating is pretty outdated in many cultures, especially in the West. But personal preferences can vary. The key issue here is whether his preference is harmful or discriminatory. The user says he's not blocking them or getting angry; he's just not interested romantically. However, the term \"slut-shaming\" usually involves making someone feel bad for their sexual activity. Even if he's not being confrontational, his rejection based on their sexual history could be seen as shaming because it's a judgment about their choices.\n\nThen there's the aspect of consent and personal autonomy. People have the right to set their own boundaries, but when those boundaries impact others' autonomy, it can become problematic. By rejecting people based on their past sexual experiences, he's imposing his personal values on others, which could be seen as controlling. Even if it's not direct, it's a form of pressure that tells others how they should live.\n\nAge is another factor. At 18, he's young and might not have a fully developed perspective on relationships. However, being young doesn't excuse potentially hurtful behavior. The girls are upset because their autonomy is being questioned, which can be hurtful. The fact that they've reacted negatively suggests that his actions are causing emotional distress, which is a red flag.\n\nThe user's justification is that he doesn't want to deal with them after, but that's a personal preference. However, using others' past as a reason to reject them without judgment is tricky. It's possible he's internalizing outdated views about purity and relationships, which are often harmful. These views can perpetuate gender inequality and stigma.\n\nOn the other hand, the user isn't forcing anyone to be with him. He's saying he has a personal preference. The question is whether personal preferences can be considered wrong if they don't harm others. But in this case, the rejection is causing emotional harm to the people involved. The girls feel shamed and judged, which is a form of harm. Thus, even if it's a personal choice, the negative impact on others makes it problematic.\n\nIn conclusion, while everyone has the right to their preferences, the way his preference affects others and upholds harmful stereotypes makes him in the wrong. So the answer is A.\n"
