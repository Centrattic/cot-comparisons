Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The author is a 18-year-old guy who says he won't date girls who aren't virgins. He mentions that when girls share they're not virgins, he loses interest. Some of them got upset and called him sexist, etc. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms and personal preferences. It's important to note that personal preferences in dating are subjective. However, the term \"virgin\" can be tricky. Some people might equate it with purity, but others see it as a personal choice. The author's refusal based on this might be seen as imposing his standards on others. \n\nNow, about being in the wrong. If someone has a preference, they're not necessarily wrong for having it, but how that preference is expressed matters. The author isn't being aggressive; he's just choosing not to pursue a relationship. However, the issue arises when this preference leads to judgment or shaming. The author mentions girls feeling shamed, which could imply that his actions, even if unintentional, contribute to that feeling. \n\nAlso, considering gender dynamics, holding a standard that's more about the other person's history rather than mutual respect might be seen as double standards. For example, if the author had a similar issue with his own past, but he doesn't mention that, it could be a point of inconsistency. \n\nThe key here is consent and mutual respect. The author isn't forcing anyone; he's just choosing who he dates. But the problem is the societal expectation and potential judgment. If the girls feel shamed, even if he doesn't mean to, he might be contributing to a negative environment. \n\nMoreover, the fact that this is a 18-year-old making a judgment based on something that's not inherently a reflection of a person's worth (past relationships or sexual history) could be problematic. It's important to recognize that people's experiences don't define their character. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author isn't breaking any laws or committing a crime, his preference might be considered outdated or discriminatory by some. He's not in the wrong for having a preference, but the way it's framed could be seen as disrespectful. The answer would lean towards him being in the wrong because of the potential harm and judgment his preference imposes on others.\n"
