Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. The author is an 18-year-old guy who says he won't date girls who aren't virgins. He claims it's not out of anger or bad feelings but just a loss of romantic interest. The girls he's rejected have called him out for slut-shaming and being sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms and ethical implications here. Virginity standards, especially when set by men, are often seen as outdated and can be part of double standards. Historically, women have been subjected to more stringent expectations regarding sexual behavior, so a man enforcing such a standard might be contributing to those harmful norms. \n\nThe author argues it's not about controlling or getting mad, but others might see it as imposing his values on others. The key point here is whether his personal preference crosses into discrimination. If he's not forcing anyone to conform but is simply stating his own dating criteria, some might argue it's his choice. However, in practice, such preferences can lead to stigma and judgment, which the girls have reacted to as slut-shaming.\n\nSlut-shaming typically involves criticizing someone for their sexual activity, often to demean or control their behavior. By rejecting women based on their sexual history, the author could be contributing to that culture, even if he doesn't intend to. The fact that the women feel \"controlled\" by his standards is significant. It's possible that his stance, though personal, perpetuates harmful attitudes.\n\nAlso, the age factor: at 18, societal expectations might be more lenient, but that doesn't excuse the behavior. It's important to consider that personal preferences shouldn't infringe on others' rights to self-determination. The women have the right to make choices about their bodies and relationships, and the author's preference might be infringing on their autonomy by judging them.\n\nOn the other hand, if he's not actively harassing or pressuring them, some might say it's his choice who he dates. But the issue is in the reaction from the women and the potential harm caused by his attitude. It's a balance between personal choice and respecting others' rights to not be judged.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might not be malicious, his preference could be seen as perpetuating harmful stereotypes and double standards. Therefore, the answer is likely that he's in the wrong.\n"
