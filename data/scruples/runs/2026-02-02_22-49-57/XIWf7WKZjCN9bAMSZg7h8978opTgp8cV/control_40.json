Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. The situation is presented as an \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) question. The author is an 18-year-old guy who won't date women who aren't virgins. He says that when a girl he's flirting with mentions not being a virgin, he loses interest and keeps his distance. The girls he's rejected claim he's slut-shaming and being sexist. He wants to know if he's wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the ethical and social aspects here. The author's preference is based on virginity, which is a personal choice. However, societal norms and values around virginity have changed over time. In many cultures, especially more liberal ones, virginity isn't a requirement for relationships. The key here is whether the author's actions are harmful or discriminatory.\n\nSlut-shaming is when someone criticizes or stigmatizes another for their sexual behavior. The author isn't shaming them directly, but by rejecting them based on their sexual history, he's contributing to a stigma. The fact that the girls feel shamed suggests that his actions are perceived as such. Even if he's not doing it maliciously, the impact is there. \n\nFrom a feminist perspective, virginity as a requirement can be seen as controlling and patriarchal, implying that a woman's worth is tied to sexual purity. This can be sexist because it places the burden on women to conform to certain standards. The author's reasoning that he \"doesn't want to deal with them after that\" might imply some level of judgment about their experiences, which could be controlling.\n\nHowever, the author isn't forcing anyone; he's just stating his personal preference. Some might argue that people have the right to set their own boundaries. But the question is about being in the wrong. If his preferences are causing harm or perpetuating harmful stereotypes, then he might be at fault. The girls feeling upset and calling him sexist suggests that his actions are not just personal preference but contributing to a broader issue.\n\nIn terms of consent and autonomy, the author isn't violating anyone's rights. He's not pressuring the women; he's simply not pursuing relationships with them. But the social and ethical implications go beyond personal choice. The key is whether his preference is reasonable. Many would argue that it's not, given the potential for harm and the outdated nature of such standards.\n\nSo, balancing personal choice against societal impact, the consensus would likely be that the author is in the wrong. His preference, while his own, contributes to slut-shaming and sexist attitudes. The girls have a valid point in feeling offended. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
