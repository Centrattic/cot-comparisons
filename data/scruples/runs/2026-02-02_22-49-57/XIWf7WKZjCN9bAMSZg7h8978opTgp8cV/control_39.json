Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they're the asshole for rejecting non-virgins. They're 18, male, and say that whenever a girl they're interested in isn't a virgin, they lose all romantic interest. They don't block or get angry, just become distant. The girls they've rejected are upset, calling them sexist and slut-shaming. The user is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the key points here. The user has a strict preference against dating non-virgins. That's their personal choice, but the issue is when people are upset and label it as harmful behavior. Now, I need to consider if just having this preference is inherently wrong. On one hand, people have various preferences in relationships, like religion, lifestyle, etc. But on the other hand, rejecting someone based on their sexual history can be seen as slut-shaming, which is a negative and judgmental attitude towards people for their sexual behavior. \n\nSlut-shaming typically involves making someone feel guilty or inferior for their sexual activity, often perpetuating double standards, like how men are often praised for multiple partners while women are criticized. The user's stance might be contributing to that. Even if their intention isn't to be hurtful, the effect on others is causing distress. \n\nAlso, the argument that it's not about controlling but just a preference is a common one. However, in many cases, such preferences can be rooted in controlling or unrealistic expectations, even if the individual doesn't see it that way. The fact that it's causing others to feel shamed or controlled might indicate that it's more than just a preference. \n\nLooking at consent and respect, the user is not pressuring the women into anything, just ending the romantic interest. But if the preference is leading to shaming, even unintentionally, it could be seen as disrespectful. The user might not be aware of the impact of their actions, but the outcome still affects others negatively.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, while some might argue that personal choice in partners is valid, there's a growing emphasis on respecting others' autonomy and not imposing judgment. The user's preference might be considered a personal choice, but the way it's presented and the reactions it's causing suggest it's crossing into problematic territory by perpetuating stigma around premarital or non-virgin sex.\n\nSo, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because their preference is contributing to slut-shaming and creating a double standard, even if they don't intend to be harmful. The negative reactions from the women indicate that their actions are being perceived as judgmental and disrespectful.\n"
