Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. The author is 18, male, and states that he loses all romantic interest if a girl isn't a virgin. He clarifies he doesn't get angry or block them, just loses interest. The girls he's rejected accused him of slut-shaming, being sexist, and controlling. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants an opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and social perspectives here. The author's personal preferences are his own, but when it comes to dating, personal standards are common. However, the issue arises when these preferences lead to judgment or discrimination. The key points here are virginity as a personal choice, societal norms, and potential double standards.\n\nIn many modern societies, virginity isn't a deal-breaker for most people. The idea that one person's choice to have had sex before disqualifies them from being a romantic partner might be seen as judgmental. The author's stance could be viewed as imposing his moral standards on others, which might be considered sexist because it's about controlling a woman's body and past. However, the author isn't trying to control them beyond his own dating choices.\n\nSlut-shaming typically involves shaming someone for their sexual history. If the author isn't shaming them beyond losing interest, maybe it's just his preference. But by labeling it as not a problem, he might inadvertently contribute to a culture that judges women for their sexual past. The girls feeling \"pissed\" and calling him sexist suggests that their perspective is that his preference is unfair, especially since women often face more scrutiny about their sexual history than men.\n\nThere's also a possible double standard if the author would have a different standard for himself. If he's holding women to a standard he wouldn't apply to men, that's definitely sexist. The post doesn't mention his standards for male partners, so that's an unknown. But the fact that he's using virginity as a criterion could imply that he values purity or innocence in a partner, which might be more traditionally associated with women, hence sexist.\n\nHowever, personal preferences in dating are allowed. People can have their own criteria. The question is whether this preference, while personal, is harmful or discriminatory. If the author isn't forcing his views on others and is just choosing not to date them, it's his choice. But societal norms are shifting towards valuing mutual respect and not judging someone's past. The girls' reactions might be valid because their choices are being negatively judged based on something that's their own business.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, he's stating his preferences. On the other, his preference may perpetuate harmful judgments. Since he's not actively shaming them beyond losing interest, maybe it's his right to be selective. But the way it's framed could be seen as judgmental. The answer might depend on context and intent. The author claims it's not about bad feelings but a loss of interest. But societal implications suggest that such preferences can contribute to a problematic culture. So, leaning towards A (the author is in the wrong) because it's a form of judgment based on others' personal choices, even if it's his own preference.\n"
