Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, an 18-year-old guy, refuses to date women who aren't virgins. He says that when a girl mentions not being a virgin, his romantic interest disappears, even though he's okay with staying friends. The girls he's rejected have accused him of slut-shaming, sexism, and being controlling. He's asking if they're right.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms and personal preferences. Choosing not to date someone based on their sexual history is a personal preference, but when does that become problematic? The key here is whether his actions are harmful or discriminatory. \n\nSlut-shaming typically involves shaming someone for their sexual activity, which can be harmful and promote negative stereotypes. If the author is making judgments that lead to shaming, then he might be in the wrong. However, he clarifies that he doesn't express anger or block them, just lose interest. But the act of rejecting based on something that doesn't affect the relationship's quality could be seen as sexist if it's based on outdated or discriminatory beliefs about women's worth based on their sexual history.\n\nSexism often involves treating someone unfairly because of their gender. If the author's preference is rooted in the idea that women should be pure or that their value is tied to their virginity, that's a traditional view that many consider sexist. It's also important to note that virginity isn't something that can be objectively measured or known without the person's disclosure, so assuming someone's status could be based on stereotypes.\n\nThe author's reasoning that he \"doesn't want to deal with them after that\" might imply he has negative assumptions about women who have had sex, which can contribute to harmful stereotypes. This could make his stance problematic. Additionally, while it's his right to have personal preferences, when those preferences are based on discriminatory beliefs and affect others' self-esteem or feelings (as the girls mentioned getting angry), it can be considered wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that it's his prerogative to have personal standards in dating. However, the line between personal preference and prejudice is thin. The fact that multiple women have felt shamed suggests that his actions are having a negative impact on them, which tips the scales towards him being in the wrong. \n\nAlso, considering that virginity isn't a choice for everyone and can be influenced by various factors like past relationships or personal experiences, judging others for it can be seen as unfair. It's important to respect others' choices and not impose one's own moral standards on them. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author isn't acting out of malice, his preference is rooted in traditional views that many find sexist. The impact on the women he's rejecting, with them feeling shamed, indicates that his actions are harmful and thus he is in the wrong. So the answer is A.\n"
