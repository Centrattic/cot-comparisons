Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is a 18-year-old guy who says he won't date girls who aren't virgins. He loses all interest if they've had sex before, even though he doesn't block them or get angry, just keeps his distance. The girls he's rejected say he's slut-shaming and being sexist and controlling. The question is if he's in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider a few angles here. Legally, there's nothing against having personal preferences in dating, right? So the author isn't breaking any laws. But socially and ethically, it's a different story. The key terms here are \"slut-shaming\" and \"sexist.\" Slut-shaming is when someone stigmatizes or discriminates against others based on their sexual activity, especially targeting women. The author's stance is that he only dates virgins, which implies that he's judging women based on their sexual history, which can be seen as slut-shaming.\n\nThen there's the aspect of consent and autonomy. A woman's decision to have sex is her own, and judging her for that could be seen as controlling. The author argues it's just his preference, but when it's based on someone else's intimate decisions, it can be viewed as sexist because it enforces traditional gender roles where a woman's value is tied to her virginity. Men aren't typically judged the same way for their sexual history, so this double standard might contribute to the perception of sexism.\n\nOn the other hand, the author doesn't force anyone or make threats; he's just stating his preference. He's not shunning them socially beyond romance. But even so, the act of rejecting someone solely based on their sexual history can be hurtful and contribute to a culture of shame around sexuality. \n\nAnother point is that virginity isn't a choice in some cases, but the author's focus is on whether someone has had sex, not other factors. Also, the author's age is 18, so he might be in a phase of figuring out his values. However, the problem isn't the age but the judgment itself.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author isn't breaking any laws, his preference is based on a value (virginity) that's subjective and can be harmful. The girls' reactions are valid because they're being judged for their personal choices, which is a form of slut-shaming and reinforces sexist norms. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
