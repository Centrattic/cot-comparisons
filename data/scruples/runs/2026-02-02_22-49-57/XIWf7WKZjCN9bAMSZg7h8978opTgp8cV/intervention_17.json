Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. Let me start by understanding the situation. The person is 18 years old, male, and he states that he won't date girls who aren't virgins. He mentions that when a girl he's interested in says she's not a virgin, his romantic interest disappears, but he's still okay with being friends. The girls he's rejected feel like he's slut-shaming and call him sexist and controlling. The author is asking if they're right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the concept of personal preferences versus harmful behavior. The author is sharing his dating standards, which is his right. People have various reasons for their preferences, and unless those preferences are based on hatred or discrimination, they might not be inherently wrong. However, societal norms and the potential impact on others are factors to consider. \n\nThe author argues he has no bad feelings, just a lack of romantic interest. The issue comes up when others perceive this as slut-shaming. Slut-shaming is generally about stigmatizing people for their sexual activity, often leading to judgment or discrimination. If the author's actions are making others feel shamed or degraded, that's a problem. But he claims he's not being hostile, just not pursuing a relationship. \n\nAnother angle is whether this preference is sexist. Sexist behavior often involves unequal treatment based on gender. If the author only applies this standard to women and not men, that could be sexist. The question doesn't mention his standards for men, so maybe that's an important detail missing. If he judges women for their sexual history but doesn't hold men to the same standard, that would be a double standard and thus sexist. But if he's applying the same criteria to both genders, it's more about personal preference.\n\nAlso, the age of the author (18) might be relevant. At 18, people are still forming their views, and while personal preferences are acceptable, it's important to reflect on why those preferences exist. If the preference is based on outdated or harmful beliefs, that could be problematic. However, the author isn't expressing hatred, just a lack of personal interest. \n\nThe girls' reactions suggest they feel judged and devalued. Even if the author isn't intending harm, the impact on others matters. The key here is whether the author's actions contribute to a culture of shame around sexual activity. If others feel pressured by his standards, that could be seen as controlling or harmful, even if he's not actively hostile.\n\nIn summary, the author's preference itself might not be wrong in terms of personal choice, but the way it affects others and whether it perpetuates harmful attitudes is a gray area. If the preference is based on personal values and he's not forcing anyone or being hostile, it's a matter of personal choice. However, if it's contributing to a judgmental environment or double standards, there could be an argument that he's in the wrong. The answer might depend on the intent and the broader social context.\n"
