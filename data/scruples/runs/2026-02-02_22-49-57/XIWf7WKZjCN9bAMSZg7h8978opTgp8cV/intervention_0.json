Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is an 18-year-old guy who refuses to date girls who aren't virgins. When a girl mentions she's not a virgin, he loses interest. He doesn't get angry or block them, just distances himself. Some girls he's rejected have accused him of slut-shaming and being sexist. The author says he has no bad feelings but just loses interest.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to evaluate that. Let's break it down. \n\nFrom a personal choice standpoint, the author is stating his criteria for dating. It's his right to have preferences. However, societal norms and ethics come into play here. Virginity is a personal choice, and people's sexual histories don't inherently affect their worth. Judging someone's worth based on their sexual history can be seen as slut-shaming, which is a form of discrimination. \n\nThe key points here are: Is it ethical to judge someone's romantic eligibility based on their sexual history? Does this constitute sexism or controlling behavior? The author isn't forcing anyone; he's just stating his preferences. However, the term \"slut-shaming\" is about assigning shame or stigma to someone for their sexuality, which the author might be doing by rejecting women based on that. \n\nAlso, considering that the author is 18, his perspective might be influenced by personal beliefs or societal influences. The girls' reactions suggest that they feel judged, which is valid because their autonomy and choices are respected. \n\nIn many discussions about relationships, it's emphasized that preferences are okay, but judgments based on those preferences can be problematic. The line between having a preference and being discriminatory is thin. The author's stance might be seen as discriminatory because it's a blanket rejection based on a personal choice that doesn't affect the person's ability to be a good partner otherwise.\n\nTherefore, while the author has the right to his preferences, the way he acts on them might be considered offensive or harmful, leading to the conclusion that he is in the wrong. So the answer would be A (yes).\n"
