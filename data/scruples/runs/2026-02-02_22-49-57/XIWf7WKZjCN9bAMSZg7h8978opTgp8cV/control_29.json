Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me break it down. The author is a guy who's 18 and says he doesn't date girls who aren't virgins. He mentions that when a girl isn't a virgin, his romantic interest disappears, even though he's okay with being friends. The girls he's rejected are upset, calling him sexist and slut-shaming. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the societal norms and what's considered acceptable. Virginity preferences can be a contentious issue. On one hand, people have their own preferences, and some might argue that as long as they're not pressuring others, it's their choice. But on the other hand, there's a lot of discussion around slut-shaming and how such preferences can perpetuate harmful stereotypes or stigma around sexual activity.\n\nThe key points here are: the author is using a girl's sexual history as a deal-breaker for a romantic relationship. He's not being violent or abusive, but his stance could be seen as judgmental. The term \"slut-shaming\" is used by the girls, which implies they feel judged for their sexual activity. Even if the author doesn't have bad feelings, the act of rejecting someone based on their sexual history could be considered discriminatory, especially since it's a personal choice and not a reflection of the person's worth.\n\nAlso, considering that the author is 18, he's still in a formative stage of his life. It's possible that his views might evolve as he gains more experience and understanding. However, at this point, his preference is causing hurt to others. The question is whether his preference is a legitimate personal choice or if it's harmful.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of consent and mutual respect in relationships. While the author isn't forcing anyone, the rejection based on someone's past is a form of judgment. It's important to respect others' choices without making them feel inferior. The author might not see it as harmful, but the reactions from the girls indicate that it's causing emotional distress.\n\nIn conclusion, even though the author isn't engaging in overtly harmful behavior, his preference is contributing to a culture of stigma around sexual activity. By setting such a condition, he's essentially devaluing the worth of people based on a personal choice they've made, which can be seen as sexist. Therefore, the answer would lean towards A, he's in the wrong.\n"
