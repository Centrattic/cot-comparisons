Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the person is 18, male, and refuses to date women who aren't virgins. He loses interest if they've had sex before, but he doesn't block them or get angry; he just distances himself. Some of the girls he's rejected have called him sexist, slut-shaming, etc. He's asking if they're right.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate if his actions are wrong. The key points here are his personal preference versus how others perceive it. He's not forcing anyone; he's just saying he doesn't want to date them. But the term \"slut-shaming\" implies that he's judging or stigmatizing them for their sexual history, which is a form of sexism. The question is whether personal preference crosses into being inconsiderate or discriminatory.\n\nIn many societies, there's a double standard regarding sexual histories of men and women. Women are often judged more harshly for having had multiple partners. By having this preference, he might be contributing to that double standard. Even if his intentions are not malicious, the impact of his actions could be harmful by reinforcing negative stereotypes.\n\nAlso, the fact that he's using this as a reason to cut off romantic interest based on something that's personal and consensual between adults could be seen as controlling or sexist. The girls are upset because they feel he's making a judgment about their worth based on their sexual history, which is a personal choice.\n\nHowever, he's not making it public or pressuring others. He's just stating his preference. But in personal interactions, such preferences can still be hurtful, even if they're not enforced publicly. The line between personal preference and being inconsiderate is blurry here. \n\nLegal and moral aspects: There's no law against this preference, but socially, it's problematic. The question is whether it's acceptable to have such a preference. Some might argue that everyone has the right to set their own boundaries, but others would say that it's prejudiced and perpetuates harmful norms.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might be in the wrong because his preference contributes to slut-shaming and sexism, even if unintentionally. The rejection is based on a personal choice that shouldn't affect someone's worth in relationships. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
