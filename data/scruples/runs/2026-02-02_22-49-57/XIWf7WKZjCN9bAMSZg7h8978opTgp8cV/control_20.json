Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. The scenario is that an 18-year-old guy says he won't date girls who aren't virgins. He claims he doesn't have bad feelings, just loses interest when they mention having had sex. Some girls he's rejected for this reason have accused him of slut-shaming and being sexist or controlling. The user wants to know if he's in the wrong, with options A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the societal norms and ethical aspects. The author's preference is based on a person's sexual history, which can be seen as a personal choice, but there's a line when it affects others. Slut-shaming is a real issue where people, especially women, are judged or discriminated against for their sexual behavior. The key here is whether the author's actions contribute to that shaming.\n\nHe doesn't block them or get angry; he just stops pursuing a relationship. That might seem like a personal preference, but the fact that his criteria is based on something that's not a reflection of the person's character or compatibility could be problematic. It's similar to other forms of discrimination where people are judged based on irrelevant factors. For example, if someone said they wouldn't date someone based on their race or religion, that's clearly discriminatory. Sexual history is a personal matter and doesn't reflect someone's worth or suitability as a partner.\n\nAlso, considering the context of the girls' reactions, they feel shamed and accused him of sexism. Sexism often involves treating people differently based on their gender, and in this case, he's applying a standard specifically to women, which can reinforce harmful stereotypes. It's possible that he's internalizing or perpetuating societal double standards about female sexuality versus male sexuality.\n\nHowever, the author might argue that it's his personal preference. But when such preferences lead to judgment or exclusion, especially when they're based on something that's not a moral failing (since virginity isn't a universal value), it can be seen as shaming. The line between personal preference and harmful behavior can be thin here. The key point is that while he's allowed to have preferences, when those preferences are rooted in judgment and lead others to feel shamed, it's not just a personal choice anymore\u2014it's contributing to a negative social dynamic.\n\nSo, putting it all together, even though he's not using force or malice, his actions are based on criteria that are not fair or respectful to the other person's autonomy. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong because his preference perpetuates slut-shaming and sexist attitudes, even if he doesn't intend to.\n"
