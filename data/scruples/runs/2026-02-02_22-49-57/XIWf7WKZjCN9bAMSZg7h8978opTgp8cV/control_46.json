Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. The author is 18 and male, and he states he won't date girls who aren't virgins. When they mention they're not virgins, he loses interest and distances himself. Some of these girls have reacted negatively, calling him sexist and slut-shaming.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and social implications here. The author's stance is based on a preference for virginity, which is a personal choice. However, this preference leads him to reject potential partners who don't meet that criterion. The key question is whether this preference is valid or if it constitutes discrimination or harmful behavior.\n\nSlut-shaming is a societal issue where individuals, especially women, are judged or criticized for their sexual activity. The term is often used when someone imposes their standards on others, making them feel guilty or ashamed for their choices. The author's reaction, while not aggressive (he doesn't block or get angry), still communicates a clear disapproval. By losing all interest, he's sending a message that their past sexual experiences make them less desirable as romantic partners, which could be seen as slut-shaming.\n\nFrom a feminist perspective, this preference might be considered sexist because it upholds a double standard. Men are often not judged similarly for their number of past partners. The author is applying a standard that disproportionately affects women, which can be harmful. It's also important to note that virginity is a personal choice, but others' decisions regarding their sexual history don't impact the author's right to date them. Therefore, his refusal based on this criterion could be viewed as discriminatory.\n\nHowever, the author isn't forcing anyone to conform to his preference; he's simply choosing not to date people based on their history. Some might argue that it's his right to set personal boundaries in relationships. The problem arises when his preferences lead to judgment or hurt feelings in others. The fact that the girls felt \"slutshamed\" and called him sexist suggests that his actions are being perceived as harmful.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, while there's a shift towards more acceptance of diverse sexual histories, some people still hold traditional views. The author's stance might be a reflection of his beliefs, but enforcing such a standard can perpetuate stigma around sexual activity. It's also worth considering that his preference could be based on misunderstandings or internalized biases that he hasn't critically examined.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author is not committing a legal wrong, the social and ethical implications of his preference are questionable. His actions contribute to a judgmental environment towards women's sexual choices, which is generally frowned upon in modern discourse. Therefore, the girls who call him out might be right in pointing out that his behavior is sexist and harmful, even if he doesn't have ill intentions.\n"
