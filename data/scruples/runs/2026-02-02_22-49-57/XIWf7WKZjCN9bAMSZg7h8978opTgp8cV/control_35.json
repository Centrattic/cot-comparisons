Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The author is a guy who says he won't date women who aren't virgins or have had multiple exes. He mentions that he doesn't have bad feelings but just loses interest, and some girls have called him sexist and slut-shaming.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms and ethical perspectives. The author is clear about his preferences, but the issue is how that affects others. The key points here are about personal choice versus judgment. He's stating his own criteria for dating, but when others react negatively, there's a question of whether his stance is harmful.\n\nSlut-shaming typically involves derogatory attitudes towards people for their sexual activity. However, in this case, the author isn't shaming but rather stating that he doesn't want to date someone based on their sexual history. The question is whether this preference is inherently wrong. \n\nFrom a personal choice standpoint, people can have their preferences. But there's also the aspect of respect and not making others feel judged. The author says he doesn't block them or get angry, but the mere act of losing all interest because of their sexual history might be seen as judgmental. \n\nIn terms of sexism, if the author is applying this standard only to women and not to himself, that could be sexist. The post doesn't mention his own sexual history, but since he's male, there's an implicit comparison here. Societal double standards often involve different expectations for men and women regarding sexual history. If the author would date a woman regardless of her past but judges women for it, that's a problem. However, if he's applying the same standard to himself, maybe not, but the post doesn't clarify his own history. \n\nThe girls reacting are calling him out for being sexist and controlling. The term \"controlling\" might be an overstatement unless he's imposing this on others, but he's just stating his own preferences. However, the term \"slut-shaming\" is about shaming others for their sexuality, which he's doing indirectly by rejecting them. \n\nLegally, he's not in the wrong because personal preferences in dating are protected. Ethically, it's more nuanced. The question is whether it's wrong to hold such a preference. If it's causing harm, like making others feel devalued, then there's a case to be made that his preference is contributing to a negative environment. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author isn't breaking any laws, his stance could be considered ethically problematic due to potential judgment and reinforcing harmful stereotypes. The answer would likely be A (yes, he's in the wrong) because his preference might perpetuate sexism and slut-shaming, even if unintentionally.\n"
