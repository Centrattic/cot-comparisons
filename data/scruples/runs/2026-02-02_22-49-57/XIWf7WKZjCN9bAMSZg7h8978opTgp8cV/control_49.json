Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nThe author is 18 and male, and he says he won't date girls who aren't virgins. When they mention they're not virgins, he loses all romantic interest but is still okay with being friends. The girls he's rejected got upset, calling him sexist, slut-shaming, etc. He's asking if they're right.\n\nFirst, I should consider societal norms and values. Virginity is a personal choice, and people have different beliefs. However, in many modern contexts, there's a push against judging others for their sexual history. The key here is whether his preference is harmful or discriminatory.\n\nHe's not forcing anyone or being violent, just stating a personal preference. But the issue might be that he's imposing his standards on others. People might feel that this is a form of judgment, especially since he's making a decision based solely on something that doesn't harm him. It could be seen as sexist because he's making assumptions about women's worth based on their sexual history, which is a common criticism of such preferences.\n\nOn the other hand, he's not pressuring anyone to change; he's just choosing who he dates. But the problem is that by expressing this preference, he's contributing to a culture of shame around women's sexuality. The girls feel shamed, which is a valid response. Even if he doesn't mean to, the effect is harmful.\n\nAlso, considering consent and autonomy, his preference isn't violating anyone's rights. However, the negative reaction is about feeling judged. So, while he has the right to his preferences, the way it's affecting others might make him in the wrong.\n\nIn terms of slut-shaming, that's about shaming someone for being sexually active. If he's doing that by rejecting them, then yes, he's participating in that behavior. Even if he's not hostile, the act of rejecting based on sexual history can be seen as slut-shaming.\n\nAnother angle: personal choice in dating. People can have preferences, but when those preferences stigmatize others, it's problematic. There's a difference between having a preference and contributing to a harmful stereotype.\n\nSo putting it all together: the author isn't breaking any laws, but his actions are contributing to negative judgments towards women, which is why the girls are upset. Therefore, he might be in the wrong because his preference reinforces harmful attitudes, even if unintentionally.\n"
