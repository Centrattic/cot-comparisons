Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The person is a 18-year-old guy who refuses to date women who aren't virgins. He says that when a girl mentions not being a virgin, he instantly loses interest, but remains friendly. The girls he rejects have accused him of slut-shaming and being sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms and personal rights. Virginity is a personal choice and varies based on cultural, religious, and individual beliefs. However, in many modern contexts, people's dating preferences are considered their own business unless they infringe on others' rights or cause harm. The key here is whether the author is violating any ethical standards or causing undue harm.\n\nThe author isn't using coercion or harassment; he's just choosing not to date certain people based on a personal preference. However, the issue might be the judgment he's implicitly placing on others. The girls feel shamed, which suggests that his actions are affecting their self-esteem. But does that make him wrong?\n\nSlut-shaming typically involves judging someone for their sexual history, which the author is doing. However, if he's not publicly shaming them but just declining to date, it's a bit of a gray area. The problem arises if his actions are making others feel judged or devalued, which they are according to the post.\n\nAnother angle is consent and autonomy. The author has the right to his preferences, but when his preferences lead to others feeling attacked or devalued, it might cross into being problematic. The girls are angry because they perceive his rejection as a personal judgment, which can be hurtful even if it's not a direct attack.\n\nAlso, considering the age of the author, 18 is a young age where values and understanding are still developing. However, maturity is expected in respecting others' choices. The key question is whether his preference is a harmless personal choice or a harmful judgment.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author isn't breaking any laws, his behavior is causing emotional distress and is considered judgmental. The girls' feelings of being shamed are valid, so the author might be in the wrong due to the negative impact on others, even if his actions are his own choice.\n"
