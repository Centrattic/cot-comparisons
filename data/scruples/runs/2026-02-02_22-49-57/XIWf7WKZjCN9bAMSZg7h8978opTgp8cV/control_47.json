Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. The author is an 18-year-old guy who says he can't date women who aren't virgins. He mentions that he loses interest if they've had sex before, but he's still friends with them. The other people reacted negatively, calling him sexist and controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms and personal preferences. Personal preferences are okay, but if they lead to discrimination or harm, that's an issue. The author isn't being violent or abusive; he's just not interested. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong. \n\nFrom a modern perspective, virginity isn't a common requirement for relationships. Some people might have personal reasons, religious, cultural, or personal beliefs. However, the author is 18, so maybe he's still forming his views. The fact that he's open to friendship might mitigate some criticism, but the rejection is based on a specific characteristic, which could be seen as judgmental.\n\nThe other people's reactions are about slut-shaming and sexism. If the author's stance is that only virgins are acceptable, it could imply that women's past sexual activity is a negative trait, which is a form of shaming. However, if his preference is a personal choice without coercion, he might not be in the wrong. But promoting such a view could be seen as reinforcing harmful stereotypes.\n\nLegal aspects? There's no law against this preference. Ethically, it's about whether it's respectful. The author isn't forcing others; he's just stating his own standards. But if it's part of a larger pattern of judgment or disrespect, that's different. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If it's his personal choice and he's not harming others, he might not be in the wrong. However, the societal context and the impact on others' feelings could argue the opposite. The answer might depend on cultural context and whether such preferences are considered discriminatory.\n"
