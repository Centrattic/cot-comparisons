Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. The scenario is that the author, an 18-year-old guy, states he won't date girls who aren't virgins. He mentions that when a girl he's interested in says she's not a virgin, he loses all romantic interest but remains friendly. The girls he's rejected feel he's being sexist or slut-shaming. The user initially thinks the author isn't wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms and personal ethics. Personal preferences in dating are generally acceptable unless they involve discrimination or harm. However, the author's stance is based on a specific moral or religious belief, perhaps. But is it okay to have such preferences?\n\nSlut-shaming is a real issue where people judge others for their sexual activity. If the author is making value judgments about women's worth based on their sexual history, that could be problematic. But the author claims he doesn't have bad feelings, just a lack of romantic interest. He's not blocking or being hostile, just not pursuing a relationship.\n\nHowever, even if it's a personal preference, the way it's framed might contribute to slut-shaming. By making it a deal-breaker, it implies that women's sexual history is a reflection of their suitability as partners, which can be seen as sexist. It's a form of controlling behavior if it's about imposing one's standards onto others without considering their autonomy.\n\nBut on the other hand, people have the right to set personal boundaries in relationships. The author isn't forcing anyone; he's just choosing not to date certain people. It's his right to have preferences, even if others disagree. The key is whether his actions are harmful. Since he's not causing direct harm beyond rejection, it's more about personal choice.\n\nThe challenge is balancing personal freedom with societal expectations. While the author's actions are within his rights, the impact on others might be negative. The women feeling shamed might not be his intention, but the effect is there. So, the answer could hinge on whether the author's preference perpetuates harmful attitudes, even if unintentionally.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author isn't breaking any laws, his stance could be considered discriminatory or sexist by others. The question is whether personal preference crosses into harmful behavior. Since the author is causing emotional distress to others by rejecting them based on their sexual history, which is a sensitive and personal matter, it's possible he's in the wrong. But if he's just stating a preference without active discrimination, it's a nuanced case. However, the societal consensus often leans against such preferences as they contribute to slut-shaming, so the answer might be A (in the wrong).\n"
