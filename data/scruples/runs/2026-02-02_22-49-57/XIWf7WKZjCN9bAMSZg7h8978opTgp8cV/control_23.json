Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. The writer is 18 and male, and he states that he loses all romantic interest if a girl isn't a virgin, has had sex before, or has multiple exes. Girls he's rejected for these reasons have accused him of slut-shaming and being sexist or controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms and personal preferences. The writer is stating his personal preference, which is valid in the sense that people can have their own criteria for romantic partners. However, the key issue here is whether this preference is harmful or discriminatory. \n\nSlut-shaming typically refers to criticizing someone for their perceived sexual behavior, often holding double standards where women are judged more harshly than men. The writer is applying a standard that could be seen as such a double standard because he's using a woman's sexual history as a deciding factor for romance, without considering his own or others' standards. This can perpetuate harmful stereotypes and contribute to a culture where women feel they must control their sexuality to be acceptable.\n\nAlso, the argument that he's just stating his preference might not absolve him from criticism if his actions are causing harm. The girls he's rejected are upset and feel targeted. Even if he's not being confrontational, his behavior can still be hurtful. \n\nFrom a gender equality standpoint, the idea that a person's sexual history should affect their worth in a relationship is problematic. It's a form of sexism because it imposes specific expectations on women that may not be applied equally to men, which can reinforce patriarchal norms. \n\nHowever, some might argue that personal preferences are okay as long as they don't harm others. But the act of rejecting someone based on a personal history that's none of his business could be seen as controlling, as he's trying to dictate their behavior indirectly. \n\nIn conclusion, while the writer isn't breaking any laws, his actions are likely perpetuating harmful attitudes and contributing to a judgmental environment. Therefore, he's in the wrong because his behavior supports slut-shaming and sexist double standards, even if his intention is just to follow his own preferences.\n"
