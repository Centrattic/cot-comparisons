Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. The author is 18 and male, and he states he won't date women who aren't virgins. He says he loses interest if they've had sex before, but doesn't get angry or block them, just stops pursuing a relationship. Some of the women he's rejected have accused him of slut-shaming, sexism, and being controlling.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if his actions are discriminatory. The key point here is the personal preference versus imposing it on others. The author is stating his own criteria for dating, which is his right. However, the issue arises if this preference leads to harmful stereotypes or discrimination. \n\nSlut-shaming typically involves judging someone for their sexual activity, but the author isn't shaming the women; he's stating his own preferences. However, the term might be used here because he's setting a standard that can be seen as judgmental. That said, if he's not making the women feel bad about themselves but just choosing not to date them, maybe it's not slut-shaming. \n\nSexism could come into play if he's treating women differently based on their sexual history, which is a form of gender-based judgment. But if he's applying the same standard to himself or others, maybe not. However, the question is about women, so if he's only applying this to women, that could be sexist. The author doesn't mention his own standards, but since he's 18, it's possible he's not a virgin himself, which might not be relevant, but if he's applying different standards to women, that could be problematic.\n\nControl and being controlling: He's not controlling their behavior; he's controlling his own choices. Controlling behavior would be if he tried to influence their decisions, which he isn't doing. He's just choosing not to date them.\n\nThe main question is whether his personal preference is wrong. Legally, he's not violating any laws. Socially, there's a shift towards more acceptance of diverse sexual histories, so his stance might be seen as outdated or contributing to stigma. But does that make him \"in the wrong\"? It's a matter of societal norms versus individual choice.\n\nHe's not forcing anyone; he's making a personal choice. Others might criticize it, but unless he's actively harming or harassing, he's not in the wrong. However, if his actions contribute to a hostile environment or perpetuate harmful norms, some might argue he's in the wrong. But in a personal context, choosing partners based on personal criteria is generally acceptable.\n\nSo, the answer would hinge on whether personal choice in dating preferences is considered wrong. Since he's not acting in a discriminatory way beyond his own standards, and not harming others, the answer is likely B (No). However, there's a social aspect where such preferences might be frowned upon, but legally and ethically, it's his choice.\n"
