Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. The author is a guy who's 18 and states that he loses all romantic interest in girls who aren't virgins or have had multiple exes. He doesn't block them or get angry, just distances himself. The girls he's rejected have called him sexist and slut-shaming.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. The author's preference is clear, but is it wrong to have such a preference? Well, people have different criteria for relationships, and some might have strong personal beliefs about virginity. However, the key here is how his actions affect others. The girls he rejects are upset, feeling shamed and labeled as controlling.\n\nSlut-shaming is generally considered harmful because it judges someone's sexual history, which is a personal choice. The author's rejection is based on their sexual history, which can perpetuate stigma. Even if he doesn't have malicious intent, the impact on others is negative. \n\nThe author's argument is that it's his personal choice, and he's not forcing anyone. But the question is whether his actions are wrong. In terms of societal values, promoting judgment based on sexual history, especially when it's not mutual, can be seen as sexist. It's a form of double standard where the author might hold women to a standard he doesn't apply to himself. \n\nAlso, considering that the author isn't open to discussing or understanding the other person's perspective, just cutting off interest immediately, it shows a lack of respect for their autonomy and experiences. The girls' reactions are valid because they feel shamed. Even if the author's intention is personal preference, the effect is harmful. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that it's his right to choose his partners based on his values. However, when this choice leads to shaming others and being labeled as controlling, it's a sign that the approach is problematic. The author isn't in the wrong for having preferences, but the way he enforces them without considering the impact makes it an issue. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because his actions contribute to slut-shaming and sexism, even if unintentionally. The harm caused to the other individuals is significant, and respecting people's choices without judgment is a more considerate approach.\n"
