Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. The author is an 18-year-old guy who states that he won't date girls who have had sex before. He mentions that when girls he's interested in aren't virgins, he loses interest and keeps his distance. The girls he's rejected are upset, calling him a slutshamer and sexist, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about personal preferences versus being discriminatory. The author states he has no ill feelings and just prefers virgins. But his preference is leading to rejection based on something that's personal and not necessarily a reflection of the person's character.\n\nSlut-shaming typically involves making someone feel bad for their sexual choices. If the author is making judgments about their worth based on their sexual history, that's problematic. Even if he's not being aggressive, his rejection could be seen as shaming because it's enforcing a standard that's often imposed by societal norms, especially in a way that's restrictive for women but not men.\n\nAlso, there's a gender aspect here. The author is a man judging women based on their sexual history, which can be seen as sexist because societal expectations often treat women's sexual behavior more judgmentally than men's. If the situation were reversed and the author was a woman rejecting men for having had multiple partners, the reaction might be different, which highlights the double standard.\n\nHowever, the author is being honest about his preferences. People do have different criteria for dating, but the issue is whether those criteria are discriminatory. By rejecting someone based on their sexual history, he's imposing his personal values on others, which can be seen as controlling or judgmental, even if he's not using force or aggression.\n\nThe girls' reactions suggest that they feel targeted and judged. The term \"slutshaming\" is often used when someone is criticized for their sexual activity, so the author's actions might fit into that category. Even if he's not intending to shame, the effect is there. The author's reasoning about not wanting to deal with them after knowing their history could imply a lack of respect for their choices.\n\nIn terms of morality, while everyone has the right to their preferences, acting on those preferences in a way that harms or judges others can be considered wrong. The key is whether the author's actions are just expressing a preference or if they're contributing to a harmful societal norm. Since he's not offering an explanation or being more understanding, it leans towards being inconsiderate.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong. His preference is based on societal standards that shame women for their sexual history, which is a form of slut-shaming and contributes to gender inequality. Even though it's his personal choice, the impact on others and the reinforcement of negative stereotypes make him at fault.\n"
