Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. The author is a guy who's 18 and says he can't be interested in women who've had sex before. The question is whether he's wrong for that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author isn't being hostile, just not pursuing relationships if the woman hasn't been a virgin. He's not being confrontational, just distancing himself when he finds out. But some women are upset, calling him sexist and slut-shaming.\n\nSlut-shaming is a term that refers to making judgments or criticisms about someone's sexual behavior, particularly against women. If the author is holding a double standard where he's okay with his own sexual history but not women's, that could be sexist. However, he's not judging them harshly or making them feel bad beyond losing interest. But even that could be seen as a form of judgment.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning is that his interest just vanishes when they're not virgins. That might be a personal preference, but when it leads to devaluing others' choices, it can be problematic. Society often has issues with such preferences, especially when they're based on outdated or unfair standards.\n\nOn the other hand, people have the right to their personal preferences in relationships. If someone isn't interested in partners with a certain background, that's their choice. But when it's framed as a moral judgment or causes harm (even if unintended), it's more complex.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions are harmful or discriminatory. Since he's not being aggressive but is still applying a standard that can be seen as oppressive, it's a gray area. However, given that his rejection is based on a woman's sexual history without considering her personal choices or autonomy, it's likely seen as problematic. The women's reactions suggest that they feel shamed, even if he doesn't intend to. So, the answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong) because his preference could be perpetuating harmful attitudes.\n"
