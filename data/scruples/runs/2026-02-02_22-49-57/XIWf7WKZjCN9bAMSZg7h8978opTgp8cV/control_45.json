Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about rejecting non-virgins and facing backlash for it. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author is 18, male, and he states that he won't date girls who aren't virgins. When he finds out they're not, he loses interest and distances himself. The girls he rejects accuse him of slut-shaming, sexism, and being controlling. He claims he doesn't have bad feelings and is open to being friends, but his romantic interest disappears. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nI should consider societal norms and ethical perspectives. Virginity preferences can be a sensitive topic. In many modern contexts, judging someone based on their sexual history is seen as problematic because it's a personal choice and doesn't affect the person's worth. Slut-shaming is generally considered harmful and discriminatory. \n\nHowever, the author isn't forcing anyone or making demands; he's stating his personal preference. But the issue arises when this preference leads to judgment or rejection, which can be hurtful. Even if he's not hostile, the act of losing all interest based on something unrelated to character or compatibility could be seen as sexist because it's a bias against women that doesn't apply to men. If he had the same standard for male partners, it might be different, but since it's specific to women, it can be considered discriminatory.\n\nAlso, the fact that the girls are upset and call him sexist suggests that his actions are perceived as such. The author's reasoning that he just \"doesn't want to deal with them\" after knowing their sexual history might imply a double standard or unrealistic expectations about relationships. It's important to note that personal preferences are valid, but when they lead to shaming or discrimination, they cross into problematic territory.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't forcing anyone to conform to his standards. It's his choice to date or not date someone based on his preferences. However, the ethical consideration here is whether his preference is harmful. By rejecting people based on their sexual history, he's perpetuating stigma and could be contributing to a culture that judges women more harshly than men. \n\nIn conclusion, while personal preferences are allowed, the way this preference is applied\u2014leading to the rejection and potential harm to others' feelings\u2014could be seen as the author being in the wrong. The key factors are the discriminatory nature of the preference and the harm caused by the rejection, even if unintended.\n"
