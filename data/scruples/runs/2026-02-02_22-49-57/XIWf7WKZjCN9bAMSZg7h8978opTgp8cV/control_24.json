Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the guy, who's 18, refuses to date girls who aren't virgins. He says he just loses interest when they mention they're not virgins, but he's still friendly with them. Some girls have called him sexist and slut-shaming.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The guy is young, 18, which is a time when people are exploring their values and preferences. His preference is a personal choice, but the question is whether that choice is wrong. \n\nSlut-shaming usually involves judging someone for their sexual activity, often in a negative way. If he's making a value judgment based on their sexual history, even without being cruel, it might still be considered slut-shaming. The key here is that his preference is based solely on virginity, which can be a controversial standard. \n\nAlso, the girls who feel rejected might see this as a double standard. If the guy is a virgin himself, that's his choice, but if he's not, then his preference could be seen as hypocritical. The post doesn't mention his own status, so maybe that's a factor. \n\nAnother angle is whether this preference is sexist. If he's applying a standard that he wouldn't apply to himself or others, that could be sexist. For example, if he judges women for their sexual history but doesn't judge men similarly, that's a problem. The post doesn't specify if that's the case, but the way he's framing it (focusing on women's virginity) might imply that. \n\nHe says he's not being hostile, just that his interest disappears. But personal preferences in dating aren't inherently wrong, but when they lead to judgment or discrimination, they can be problematic. The girls taking offense might be justified because their sexual history is irrelevant to their worth. \n\nHowever, he's also stating that it's his choice who he dates, so does that mean it's not his fault? But societal views often consider such preferences as contributing to harmful attitudes, even if the person isn't overtly mean. \n\nI think the answer leans towards A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because his preference could be seen as slut-shaming and perpetuating outdated norms. Even if he's not hostile, it's a judgment based on something that's not his business and can hurt others. But maybe there's a middle ground. Since the question is about being in the wrong, not just his preference, but the reaction from others. The girls' reactions (calling him sexist) suggest that his actions are harmful, even if he doesn't intend to be.\n"
