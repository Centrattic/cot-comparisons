Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that he's an 18-year-old guy who refuses to date girls who aren't virgins. He says he loses all interest if they've had sex before, but he doesn't block them or get angry, just keeps distance. Some of the girls he's rejected have accused him of slut-shaming, sexism, and being controlling. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is being selective based on a personal preference. It's his choice to date or not date someone based on their sexual history. However, the issue might be how this preference is framed. The girls feel shamed or judged, which can be problematic. Slut-shaming involves making someone feel guilty or ashamed about their choices regarding sex. If the author is expressing a preference without judgment, that's different from shaming. But if his actions make others feel bad about their choices, that's where the problem might lie.\n\nAlso, the age is 18, so he's a young adult. At that age, people are still forming their views on relationships. The question is whether his preference is valid. Legally and ethically, people can have preferences in partners as long as they're not discriminatory. But societal norms and values also play a role. In many modern societies, there's a push towards accepting people's sexual histories as personal choices without judgment. So, the author's stance might be seen as out of step with these values, which could lead others to perceive it as sexist or controlling, even if that's not his intention.\n\nAnother angle is consent and autonomy. The author is not pressuring anyone or making decisions for others. He's choosing not to date them. However, if his rejection is based on a moral or religious belief, that's his right. But the problem arises if the rejection is framed as a moral failing for the other person. The girls might feel he's imposing his standards on them, which is a form of judgment.\n\nAlso, the number of exes or sexual partners might be a factor. If he's using this as a way to control or restrict who he dates, but the reasons are personal and not harmful, it's tricky. The author isn't forcing anyone, but his preferences could be seen as restrictive or discriminatory. The key is whether his actions are causing harm. If the girls are upset because they feel judged, then he might be contributing to a negative environment, even if he doesn't intend to.\n\nIn summary, while the author is within his rights to have personal preferences, the way these preferences affect others and the societal context in which they're expressed might make him \"in the wrong\" in terms of social acceptability and empathy. The girls' reactions suggest that the author's preference is causing hurt, which could mean he's in the wrong, even if he's not acting maliciously.\n"
