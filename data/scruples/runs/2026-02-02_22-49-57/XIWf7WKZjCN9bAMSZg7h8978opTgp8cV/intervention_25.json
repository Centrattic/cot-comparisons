Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. The author is 18, male, and states that he loses all romantic interest if a girl isn't a virgin. The question is whether he's in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms and values. Virginity preferences can be controversial. From one perspective, personal choice in relationships is important. People have their own deal breakers. But on the other hand, the concept of virginity itself is subjective and varies across cultures and individuals. Some might argue that it's sexist because it imposes a standard that's not typically expected from men. The author mentions not having negative feelings, just losing interest. However, the way it's presented could be seen as shaming others for their past, even if unintentionally.\n\nThe term \"slutshaming\" is used by the girls he's rejected. That's a strong term, and if the author's actions contribute to that, even if not maliciously, it could be problematic. The fact that he doesn't block them but just lose interest might mitigate some blame, but the core issue is his preference itself. \n\nIn many discussions about relationship deal breakers, people are often encouraged to reflect on where their preferences come from. If it's based on outdated or harmful beliefs, it's worth reconsidering. However, if it's a personal preference without coercion, some might argue it's his right to choose. But the key here is that the girls feel shamed and called him sexist. There's a difference between having a preference and making others feel bad for not meeting it. \n\nI think the author's stance is problematic because it's enforcing a standard that's not reciprocal and can be hurtful. Even if he doesn't intend to shame, the effect is there. So the answer might be A (he's in the wrong), but I need to check if there's a nuance. The user says they think the author isn't wrong, maybe because it's a personal choice. But societal impact matters. The answer likely hinges on whether the preference is harmful. Since it leads to others feeling shamed, it's more A. But I'm a bit torn. Let me double-check. The author is not forcing anyone, just choosing who to date. However, the preference can perpetuate stigma. In many contexts, being a virgin isn't a common requirement, and such a stance can be seen as discriminatory. So, probably A is the right answer here.\n"
