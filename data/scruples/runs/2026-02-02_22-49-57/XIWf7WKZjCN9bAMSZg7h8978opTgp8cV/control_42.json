Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. The author is 18 and male, and he states that he loses all romantic interest in girls who aren't virgins. He claims he doesn't have bad feelings towards them, just no romantic interest, but some girls have accused him of slut-shaming and being sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author isn't being aggressive or abusive; he's just not interested in people who don't meet his criteria. However, his preference is based on a moral or personal standard that may not be universally accepted. In many societies, virginity isn't a requirement for dating, and such preferences can be seen as outdated or discriminatory, especially when it leads to rejection without malicious intent.\n\nThe key points here are: 1) The author's personal preference vs. others' autonomy. 2) Whether his actions constitute slut-shaming or sexism. 3) The impact on the other people involved.\n\nSlut-shaming is about making someone feel ashamed about their sexual activity. If the author is rejecting others based on their sexual history without judgment, but others feel shamed by his rejection, that's a valid concern. Even if he doesn't mean to shame, the effect is there. \n\nAlso, the idea that only virgins are acceptable for dating can be seen as controlling because it imposes a standard on others' bodies and choices. It's a form of gatekeeping, which can be restrictive and judgmental. \n\nHowever, the author isn't forcing anyone; he's just stating his own preferences. People have the right to set their own boundaries. The question is whether his preference is within a socially acceptable range or if it crosses into harmful territory. \n\nIn modern dating norms, such a strict preference might be viewed as prejudiced, especially when applied to others' private lives. While personal choice matters, when it leads to others feeling judged or excluded, it can be problematic. The girls who are upset might feel that their autonomy is being disrespected. \n\nSo, the author isn't breaking any laws or being violent, but his stance might perpetuate outdated gender norms and contribute to a judgmental environment. Therefore, even if his intention is neutral, the impact might make him complicit in harmful behavior. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because his preference could be seen as discriminatory and contributing to a negative environment, even if he doesn't intend to harm.\n"
