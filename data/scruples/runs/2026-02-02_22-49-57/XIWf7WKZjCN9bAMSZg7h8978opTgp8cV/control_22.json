Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The author is a guy who refuses to date women who aren't virgins, and some of these women have accused him of slut-shaming and being sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms and values. In many modern societies, people's sexual histories are generally considered personal and not a valid reason to judge someone's worth. The idea that a person's value is tied to their sexual history, especially with regard to virginity, is often seen as outdated and discriminatory. This can be linked to concepts like sexual autonomy and the right to make personal choices without judgment.\n\nThe author's actions might be viewed as discriminatory because they're basing romantic interest solely on a woman's sexual past, which can be seen as a form of prejudice. It's similar to other forms of discrimination where a specific characteristic is used to reject someone without considering other qualities. The women's reactions of feeling shamed and accused of being sexist might stem from the perception that their choices are being judged negatively.\n\nHowever, the author mentions that he doesn't have ill intentions and is just honest about his preferences. He also states that he's open to being friends. This could be a point in his favor, but the issue is more about the impact of his actions rather than his intent. Even if his intentions are good, the effect on others is significant, leading to hurt feelings and accusations of shaming.\n\nAnother angle is personal choice in relationships. People have the right to set their own criteria for partners, but when those criteria are based on a standard that negatively impacts others' self-esteem or perpetuates harmful stereotypes, it can be problematic. The key here is whether the standard is reasonable or if it's imposing outdated values on others.\n\nIn terms of gender dynamics, placing the emphasis on a woman's virginity can reinforce patriarchal norms that control women's bodies and sexuality. This can contribute to a culture where women feel they need to conform to certain standards to be considered acceptable partners, which is a form of sexism.\n\nThe author's reasoning that he \"doesn't want to deal with them after that\" suggests a lack of empathy and a reductionist view of potential partners. It's important to consider that people's pasts don't define their worth, and the author's approach might prevent meaningful connections based on mutual respect and understanding.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might not have ill intentions, his actions do perpetuate harmful attitudes and contribute to a judgmental environment. Therefore, he is likely in the wrong based on the impact of his behavior, even if his intent is not malicious.\n"
