Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. The author is a guy who's 18 and states he won't date women who aren't virgins. He says he loses interest if they mention they've had sex, but doesn't block them, just keeps distance. The girls he's rejected are calling him sexist and slut-shaming. The user wants to know if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the arguments from both sides. On one hand, the author is being honest about his preferences. He's not forcing anyone, just not pursuing relationships. But the issue is about whether his stance is sexist or harmful. Virginity is a personal choice and varies across cultures and individuals. By rejecting women based on their sexual history, the author is imposing his own standards on others. This could be seen as discriminatory because it's a judgment based on a personal aspect that doesn't affect the individual's worth or ability to be a good partner. \n\nSlut-shaming usually refers to judging someone for their sexual activity, but here the author is rejecting people based on that, which can be a form of shaming. Even if he doesn't have ill intentions, the effect of his actions is to devalue women's choices. Also, considering that men often aren't held to the same standards (if a woman judges a man for his sexual history, it's less common), this could contribute to double standards. \n\nHowever, the author isn't making the girls do anything; they're free to date others. But the question is about being in the wrong. The key here is whether his personal preference crosses into discrimination. Since he's not using force or coercion, but his preference is based on something that's not relevant to a relationship's success, it's more about personal bias. \n\nIn many ethical frameworks, judging people for their past consensual choices is considered problematic. So the girls might be right in saying he's sexist, as it's a form of gender-based judgment. The answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because his preference is discriminatory and reinforces harmful stereotypes.\n"
