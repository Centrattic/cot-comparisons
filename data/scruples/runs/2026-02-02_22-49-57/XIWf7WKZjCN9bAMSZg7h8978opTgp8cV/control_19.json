Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong based on their situation. Let me read through their question again.\n\nThey're an 18-year-old guy who says he won't date girls who aren't virgins. When girls mention they've had sex before, he loses interest and keeps his distance. He doesn't block them or get angry; he's just not interested romantically anymore. The girls he's rejected have accused him of slut-shaming, sexism, and being controlling. He's asking if they're right.\n\nFirst, I should consider the concept of personal preferences in dating. It's common for people to have certain criteria for potential partners. For example, someone might prefer someone who's into hiking or who shares their love for a specific hobby. So, if someone's a vegan, they might not date someone who eats meat. But when it comes to something like virginity, which is a personal choice and varies widely across cultures and individuals, it might be more sensitive.\n\nVirginity is a personal matter, and a person's decision to be or not be a virgin is their own. By choosing not to date people based on their sexual history, the author is imposing his standards on others. This could be seen as judgmental. The term \"slut-shaming\" refers to shaming someone for their sexual behavior, which is a form of discrimination. If the author is making a girl feel bad about her past experiences just because he doesn't want to date her, that could fit under that term.\n\nHowever, the author says he doesn't have bad feelings and is okay with being friends. So maybe he's not actively shaming them, but the issue is that his preference is causing them to feel judged. The key here is whether his preference is a personal choice (which it is) or if it's discriminatory. Since the girls are upset and feel judged, there's a social aspect to consider. Societal norms have been shifting towards accepting people's sexual histories as personal and not a basis for discrimination.\n\nAlso, considering the age of the author, 18, he's still young and might not have fully developed his views on these matters. But that's not necessarily a factor in whether he's right or wrong. The main point is about respecting others' choices and not making them feel bad for their past.\n\nIn terms of sexism, if the preference is gender-specific\u2014like only caring about women's virginity but not men's\u2014it could be sexist. The author mentions \"girls,\" so it's possible he's applying this standard only to women, which would be sexist. If he had the same standard for men, maybe it's a different scenario, but as stated, it's about women.\n\nSo, the author's preference is his right, but the way it's causing others to feel judged might make him in the wrong. The line between personal preference and discrimination is thin. While he's allowed to have his own standards, if his actions lead others to feel shamed or pressured, that's where the problem lies. Therefore, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because his actions, even if not malicious, contribute to a judgmental environment and reinforce harmful stereotypes about women's worth being tied to their sexual history.\n"
