Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. They're a guy, 18 years old, and he says he won't date girls who aren't virgins. The key points here are about the reasons for his rejection and the reactions he's getting from others.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user is making a personal choice based on his own preferences. However, the issue is whether this preference is problematic. The girls he's rejecting feel shamed and accuse him of being sexist and controlling. That's a strong reaction. \n\nNow, thinking about societal norms and personal values. In many modern contexts, virginity isn't a requirement for dating, and people often have diverse views on this. His stance might be based on personal beliefs, maybe from his upbringing or specific values. But the problem arises when his preferences are causing harm or making others feel judged. \n\nSlut-shaming is a real issue where people, especially women, are criticized for their sexual activity. If his rejection is contributing to that, even unintentionally, it could be problematic. The fact that the girls get angry and feel shamed suggests that their experience of his behavior is negative. \n\nOn the other hand, the user claims he's not being hostile; he's just losing interest and maintaining a friendship. But the line between personal preference and shaming can be thin. Even if he doesn't mean to shame them, the impact of his actions is causing pain. \n\nIs it his right to have such preferences? People have various criteria for dating partners, like religion, interests, etc. However, preferences based on something as personal and not harmful as sexual history can be seen as discriminatory. It's about whether his preference is respectful or if it's imposing his standards on others. \n\nThere's also the aspect of sexism. If he applies this standard only to women and not to himself or others, that's a clear double standard. But the user's post doesn't mention his own sexual history, so maybe that's a missing piece. If he's judging women for something he wouldn't judge himself for, that's sexist. \n\nHe might not have ill intentions, but intent vs. impact matters here. Even without malice, the effect of his actions is causing others distress, which could make him responsible. \n\nIn conclusion, while he's allowed to have personal preferences, if those preferences lead to shaming others or enforcing a double standard, then he's in the wrong. The key is whether his actions contribute to slut-shaming, which they seem to based on the reactions. So the answer is likely A (he is in the wrong), but I need to check if there's a nuance I'm missing.\n"
