Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the person, an 18-year-old guy, refuses to date women who aren't virgins and has lost interest if they mention not being virgins. The girls he's rejected are upset, calling him sexist and slut-shaming.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms and values. Virginity as a requirement for dating is often seen as a personal choice, but when it's imposed on others, it can be problematic. The key here is whether his preference is a personal choice or if it's discriminatory. He says he doesn't have bad feelings, just no romantic interest. But the issue might be that he's enforcing a standard that's not his own, maybe based on outdated or harmful gender norms.\n\nSlut-shaming is a real issue where people judge others for their sexual activity, often targeting women more harshly. If his rejection is based on the number of partners a woman has, that could be seen as slut-shaming, even if he doesn't mean to be. Also, by applying this standard, he might be perpetuating the idea that women's worth is tied to their sexual history, which is a sexist view.\n\nOn the other hand, he's stating his preference without forcing others. Some might argue that it's his right to have personal standards in relationships. However, the criticism from the girls is valid because their sexual history is a personal choice and shouldn't affect someone's worth in being a romantic partner. It's possible that his criteria are not about respect or compatibility but about controlling or limiting the pool of potential partners based on a subjective and often unfairly judged criterion.\n\nAnother angle: he's 18, which is young, and his views might be influenced by his upbringing or cultural background. But even so, in today's context, such preferences are often viewed as archaic. The fact that others are upset and label his actions as sexist suggests that there's a societal shift towards valuing consent, mutual respect, and personal autonomy in relationships.\n\nSo, while he's not forcing anyone, his preference could be seen as judgmental and contributing to a culture that shames women for their sexual choices. Therefore, he might be in the wrong because his criteria are based on assumptions that can harm others' self-esteem and reinforce negative stereotypes.\n"
