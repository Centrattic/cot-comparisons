Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. The author is 18, male, and states he won't date girls who aren't virgins. He doesn't get angry, just loses interest and keeps distance. The girls he's rejected say he's slut-shaming and being sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms and ethics. Virginity isn't a standard that applies equally to both genders; it's often more scrutinized towards women. The author's preference might be based on outdated or harmful stereotypes. By rejecting women based on their sexual history, he's imposing his own standards without considering their autonomy. This could be seen as sexist because it's not a reciprocal expectation for men to be virgins. \n\nSlut-shaming is about criticizing someone for their sexual activity, but here the author is the one shaming by rejecting others. His reasoning that he \"doesn't have bad feelings\" doesn't negate the harm in the action. The girls feel targeted because their choices are judged. \n\nAlso, the author's age is 18, so he might not have developed mature views on relationships yet. However, being young doesn't excuse the behavior. The key issue is whether the preference is valid. Personal preferences are okay, but when they lead to judgment or discrimination, they become problematic. \n\nThe author argues he's just not interested, but others can see this as controlling or sexist. The fact that others are upset and label it as slut-shaming suggests that society often sees such preferences as discriminatory. So, the author is in the wrong because his preference is imposing his values on others and can be harmful, even if he doesn't intend to be.\n"
