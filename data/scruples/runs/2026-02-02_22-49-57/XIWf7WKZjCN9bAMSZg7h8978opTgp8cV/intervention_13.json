Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. The author is a guy who says he only dates virgins and loses interest if a girl mentions she's not a virgin. The question is whether his stance is wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider different perspectives. On one hand, the author is being honest about his preferences. He's not forcing anyone to date him; he's just stating what he's looking for. People often have specific criteria when it comes to relationships, so maybe that's okay. But on the other hand, some might argue that this is a form of judgment or discrimination based on something that's personal and not necessarily relevant to a person's character or worth.\n\nThe term \"slutshaming\" comes up here. If the author's rejection is making others feel judged or embarrassed for their past, then maybe there's an issue. But the author claims he has no bad feelings and is fine with being friends. However, the act of rejecting someone based on their sexual history could be seen as controlling or sexist because it's placing a condition on their worthiness for a relationship that isn't mutual.\n\nAlso, societal norms have evolved where people generally support the idea that individuals should have autonomy over their bodies and relationships. Judging someone for their past sexual experiences might be considered outdated or disrespectful. The author's preference is his own, but acting on it might impose his standards on others, which could be problematic.\n\nAnother angle is that while it's his right to have personal preferences, expressing them in a way that makes others feel shamed isn't healthy. The key here is whether he's being shaming or just stating his preferences. The original post mentions that the girls get angry and call him sexist, which suggests that his actions are causing hurt feelings, even if he doesn't intend to.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author isn't breaking any laws, his behavior could be seen as disrespectful or discriminatory. It's about whether personal preferences should override the other person's autonomy and how it affects their self-esteem. So, depending on the context, the answer could lean towards him being in the wrong because of the potential harm caused, despite his intentions.\n"
