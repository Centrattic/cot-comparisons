Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The author is a guy who refuses to date girls who aren't virgins and distances himself when they mention not being virgins. He says he doesn't have bad feelings, just loses interest. The girls he's rejected feel like he's slut-shaming and being sexist.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and social implications here. The author's preference is personal, but is it problematic? He's not forcing anyone; he's just choosing his own dating pool. However, virginity standards can be seen as judgmental and patriarchal. They might put pressure on women to conform to certain expectations, which can be hurtful. The girls feel shamed, which is a valid emotional response. \n\nOn the other hand, the author claims he has no ill intentions and is just being honest about his preferences. People have the right to set their own boundaries. But does it become wrong if those preferences reinforce harmful stereotypes? Slut-shaming often stems from double standards where women are judged more harshly for their sexual history than men. If the author is applying this standard without considering the societal context, that could be problematic. \n\nAlso, the term \"slut-shaming\" is relevant here. Even if the author isn't using derogatory language, his actions still contribute to a culture where a woman's value is tied to her sexual history. It might not be illegal or physically harmful, but socially, it's contentious. \n\nThe author's response to rejection by the women is to step back without confrontation. He's not using aggression but is still making a judgment. The key is whether his personal preference crosses into hurting others or upholding harmful norms. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author isn't breaking any laws, his stance could be seen as perpetuating a harmful double standard. The women's reactions are valid because they feel shamed. So, the answer might lean towards the author being in the wrong, but there's nuance. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong, not just whether the girls are right. Given societal standards, the answer is likely A.\n"
