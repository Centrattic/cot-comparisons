Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for rejecting non-virgins. The author is a 18-year-old guy who says he can't date women who have had sex before because his romantic interest disappears. Some of the girls he's rejected got angry, calling him sexist and slut-shaming. He doesn't have ill feelings, just no longer interested.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. From the author's standpoint, he's being honest about his preferences. He's not making the girls feel bad beyond losing interest; he's still open to being friends. But from the other side, the girls feel shamed and discriminated against. The key here is whether his preference is harmful or discriminatory.\n\nSlut-shaming typically involves shaming someone for their sexual activity, which can be damaging and promote double standards. The author's stance might be seen as enforcing a standard that only applies to women, which is sexist. Even if he's not intending to shame, the effect might still be harmful. Also, this preference could be based on outdated or unfair notions about purity, which can perpetuate inequality in relationships.\n\nHowever, the author isn't forcing anyone to conform; he's just stating his own criteria for dating. People have different preferences, and some might have religious or personal reasons for valuing virginity. The issue is whether his preference crosses into judgment or discrimination. Since he's not using it as a weapon to hurt but rather as a personal standard, maybe there's a middle ground. But the fact that it's causing hurt feelings and being called sexist suggests that societal norms may view this as problematic.\n\nIn terms of ethics, while personal preferences are valid to a degree, when they contribute to harmful stereotypes or inequality, they can be considered problematic. The author's stance might not be malicious, but it could still perpetuate ideas that devalue women based on their sexual history. That's where the conflict lies.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the answer might be that the author is in the wrong not because he has preferences, but because his preference could be seen as enforcing a harmful standard. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
