Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author is an 18-year-old guy who says he doesn't date girls who aren't virgins. He mentions that when girls he's interested in are not virgins, he loses all romantic interest but remains friendly. However, some of these girls got upset, accusing him of slut-shaming, sexism, and being controlling. The author is asking if they're right.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms and personal preferences. It's his right to have personal standards about who he dates. But where does it cross into being problematic? If he's not being aggressive or causing harm beyond personal rejection, it's within his right. However, by implying that non-virgins are less desirable, it might perpetuate harmful stereotypes. \n\nSlut-shaming is a real issue where people judge others based on their sexual activity. The author's preference could be seen as enforcing a double standard, where men are allowed to have multiple partners but women are judged. This can contribute to sexist attitudes even if unintentional. \n\nOn the other hand, people have the right to choose their partners based on personal preferences. The author isn't forcing anyone, just stating his own boundaries. The question is whether his preference is inherently wrong. Some might argue that it's not harmful as long as he's respectful and not pressuring others. Others might say it's discriminatory regardless of intent.\n\nThe key points are: The author is honest about his preferences, not hostile, but his stance could be viewed as promoting outdated gender norms. The girls' reactions are about feeling judged and shamed. Even if the author doesn't mean to, his preference can still be hurtful. \n\nIn modern discussions, there's a push for personal autonomy and consent in relationships. Preferring virgins might be seen as objectifying or not respecting others' sexual choices. However, if he's not acting out of malice and is clear about his preferences without coercion, it's a matter of personal choice. But the potential harm in terms of societal norms and the impact on others' feelings is significant.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It's a nuanced answer. Legally and in terms of personal freedom, he's not violating any laws. Ethically, it depends on perspective. The answer would likely be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because his preference perpetuates harmful stereotypes and contributes to slut-shaming, even if unintentionally. Alternatively, B (No) could be argued because it's his right to have personal preferences. However, given the AITA context, the community often leans towards the former, viewing such preferences as problematic.\n"
