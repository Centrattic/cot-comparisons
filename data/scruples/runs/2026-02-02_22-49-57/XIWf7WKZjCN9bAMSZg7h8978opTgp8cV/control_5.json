Let's just jump to the point; I won't date girls who aren't virgins. Every time I've been interested in or flirting with a girl and she mentions not being a virgin I lose all interest in her, and keep my distance. I just do, literally 0% interest if they've had sex before. I don't block them or get mad or anything, I'm totally up for having them as buddies or whatever, but a fair few girls who I've rejected for this reason have gotten really pissed and said I'm \"slutshaming\" and that I'm sexist and controlling and shit. \n\nAre they right? I don't have any bad feelings towards them, it's just that any romantic interest sort of evaporates if they're not virgins, or have had several exes or whatever. I don't want to deal with them after that tbh\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe author is an 18-year-old guy who won't date girls who aren't virgins. He says that when a girl mentions she's not a virgin, his interest drops to zero. He doesn't get angry or block them, just keeps his distance and is okay with being friends. However, some girls he's rejected have accused him of slutshaming, being sexist, and controlling. He's asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the societal context. Virginity is a personal choice and varies across cultures and individuals. The author's preference is based on his personal standards, but the question is whether this is problematic or harmful.\n\nFrom a standpoint of respect and consent, it's important to note that a person's sexual history is none of another person's business unless they are in a relationship. The author is making a judgment based on someone else's past, which can be seen as disrespectful. By rejecting someone solely because of their sexual history, he's imposing his own moral standards on others, which can be considered judgmental and discriminatory.\n\nSlut-shaming is a real issue where individuals, especially women, are criticized or stigmatized for their sexual behavior. The author's actions could be contributing to this stigma, even if he doesn't intend to. By stating that his interest vanishes upon knowing their sexual history, he's devaluing their autonomy and choices.\n\nAdditionally, the author's justification that he doesn't want to deal with them after that might imply that he holds negative stereotypes about non-virgins, such as assuming they are less committed or less pure, which can be sexist. It's important to recognize that a person's worth isn't determined by their sexual history.\n\nHowever, the author isn't forcing anyone; he's just expressing his own preferences. But the issue is more about how his actions affect others. The girls he's rejected feel shamed, which is a valid emotional response. The author might not have ill intentions, but the impact of his actions is still harmful.\n\nIn terms of ethics, while personal preferences are allowed, they become problematic when they lead to judgment or harm. The key here is whether the author is respecting the other person's autonomy. By rejecting someone based on their past, he's not respecting their choices and experiences, which can be seen as controlling or sexist.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong because his actions contribute to slut-shaming and impose his moral standards on others, even if unintentionally. The answer would be A, yes, he's in the wrong.\n"
