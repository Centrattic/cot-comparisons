My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the mother hasn't worked since marrying the dad 40 years ago. The dad does most of the household work and is the sole income provider. The mother is critical of his income and complains about their lifestyle not being lavish enough. She's described as acting like a \"petulant child,\" has no hobbies, and focuses on wealth-related conversations. She shows little interest in the author's life, even criticizing their promotion. The author has been affected by this for 20 years, visits once a year, and now responds by being cold and avoiding interaction, even to the point of leaving the room when the mother enters.\n\nThe author's behavior includes not speaking much, showing dislike, and avoiding interaction. The question is whether this makes them wrong. \n\nFrom one angle, respect in family dynamics is important. Even if the mother is difficult, treating someone with zero respect can escalate conflicts and harm relationships. The author's actions might be seen as disrespectful, regardless of the mother's behavior. However, the mother's behavior is clearly toxic and negative, which could justify the author's frustration. \n\nBut the key here is the author's approach. While the mother may have contributed to the negative environment, the author's response of complete disengagement and open disdain might be considered disrespectful. Even if the mother is at fault, the author's actions could be seen as crossing a line. However, given the long-term emotional toll and the mother's lack of effort to improve, some might argue the author is justified in setting boundaries. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The mother's behavior is not excusable, but the author's treatment of the mother is the focus. The answer might hinge on cultural expectations and individual perspectives. In many cultures, respect is expected regardless of the other person's actions. However, if the mother is emotionally abusive, the author's decision to distance themselves could be seen as self-preservation. \n\nStill, completely cutting off interaction or showing open contempt might be seen as disrespectful. The author might be justified in feeling this way but could handle it differently, like setting boundaries without total disengagement. But given the context, maybe the author isn't wrong. But the question is whether they're in the wrong. \n\nI'm leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because the mother's behavior is clearly toxic and the author is seeking to protect their mental health. However, others might argue that respect is still required regardless. It's a tough call. But the author's actions are a reaction to long-term neglect and negativity. So, maybe not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
