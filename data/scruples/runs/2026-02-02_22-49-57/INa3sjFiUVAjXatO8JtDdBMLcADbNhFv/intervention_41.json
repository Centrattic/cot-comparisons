My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. So, the key points here are the mother's behavior and the author's response.\n\nThe mother hasn't worked in 40 years, relying solely on the dad's income. She's critical of his earnings and acts petulantly. She has no hobbies, only focuses on wealth and friends. She's dismissive of the author's achievements, like the promotion. The author feels resentment, avoids interaction, and shows open disdain during visits.\n\nFirst, I need to consider family dynamics and respect. Respecting family is important, but it's also about mutual respect. If the mother is neglectful and negative, does that justify the author's behavior? The author is an adult now, living across the country, which might affect their relationship. The mother's lack of support and constant criticism could contribute to the author's frustration.\n\nHowever, treating someone with zero respect is generally not acceptable, regardless of the reasons. Even if the mother is difficult, open disdain and avoidance might not be appropriate. The author might feel justified, but disrespect can damage relationships further. The right approach might be setting boundaries while still showing some respect.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the mother's behavior is toxic, maybe the author's reaction is a form of self-preservation. But society often expects a certain level of respect towards parents. So, where's the balance?\n\nIn many cases, it's seen as important to respect parents, but if they are harmful, it's about protecting one's mental health. The author's actions are extreme, but maybe their reasoning is understandable. The answer might depend on cultural context, but the user is asking for an opinion based on the situation. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but others might argue otherwise. I need to decide if the author's actions are justified or if they should seek a more respectful approach despite their feelings.\n"
