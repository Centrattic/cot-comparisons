My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author treating their mother with zero respect during visits, which they've been doing for 20 years before moving out. The mother is described as not having a job for 40 years, being financially dependent on the father, constantly complaining about his income, and lacking interest in the author's and siblings' lives.\n\nFirst, I need to consider family dynamics and respect. The mother's behavior sounds toxic and disrespectful towards her husband, which the author is clearly upset about. However, the author's response is to completely cut off communication and show disdain during visits. The question is about whether this is justified or if the author is in the wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the mother's actions (berating the husband, complaining, neglecting her children's lives) are definitely problematic. The author has reasons to feel neglected and frustrated. But on the other hand, treating someone with zero respect, especially a parent, can have its own ethical issues. Even if the mother is difficult, the author's approach of leaving the room, not engaging, and openly showing dislike might be seen as disrespectful, regardless of the mother's behavior. \n\nCultural norms about respect and filial piety might play a role here. In many cultures, children are expected to respect their parents regardless of the parents' behavior. However, the mother's constant negativity and lack of support could justify the author's feelings. The key point is the author's actions versus their feelings. While it's valid to feel upset, the way they express that anger\u2014through complete disrespect\u2014might not be the right approach. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that their dad has been the sole provider and has done most of the work. The mother's dissatisfaction despite this could be her own issue, but the author's solution is to withhold respect, which might not address the underlying problems. Maybe the author should have tried to communicate their feelings rather than just cutting off interaction entirely. \n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. If the mother is indeed the source of the negativity and has not contributed to the family, the author's actions might be a form of self-defense or protecting their mental health. However, completely disengaging and showing hatred could be harmful to family relationships and might not be the most constructive way to handle it. \n\nI think the answer depends on whether the author's actions are proportionate to the mother's behavior. The mother's actions are harmful, but the author's response is extreme. However, in some contexts, people might argue that the author is just standing up for themselves after years of mistreatment. But generally, even in difficult situations, maintaining some level of respect is considered important. So the author might be in the wrong for their disrespectful treatment, though the mother's behavior is clearly bad. \n\nBut the question is specifically whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Considering that the author is actively showing no respect and avoiding interaction entirely, which is a harsh response, I would lean towards A. However, if the mother's actions are the main issue, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. It's a bit of a tough call. The key is whether the author's treatment is justified. \n\nI think the answer is A because the author is not trying to address the situation with communication or finding a middle ground. Instead, they're expressing hatred and disrespect, which is not acceptable regardless of the mother's behavior. Even if the mother is toxic, the author's actions can be seen as wrong. So I'll go with A.\n"
