My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. Let me break down the details provided in the scenario.\n\nFirst, the mother hasn't worked since marrying the father 40 years ago. The father is the sole provider, handling most household tasks. The mother is described as constantly criticizing her husband's income, complaining about her lifestyle, and acting like a \"petulant child.\" She has no hobbies or interests beyond discussing wealth with friends, who are similar in status. She shows little interest in the author's and siblings' lives, even criticizing a promotion. The author is fed up and responds by being extremely disrespectful during visits, avoiding interaction, and leaving the room when the mother enters. They've been living away for 20 years but still visit once a year, which they find miserable.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, showing zero respect and open disdain towards a parent might be seen as disrespectful regardless of the parent's behavior. Family dynamics can be complex, and even if the mother has flaws, the child's response might be seen as excessive. The author's approach might escalate conflict and hurt family bonds. Respect is often expected in familial relationships, even when the other party is not perfect.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother's behavior is clearly problematic. She's emotionally neglectful, critical, and self-centered. The father has been the primary caregiver and breadwinner, which might have led to resentment or imbalance. The author's experience of being criticized and ignored could justify their feelings of anger and frustration. In such cases, people might feel justified in setting boundaries, especially if they've endured years of negative treatment. The author's actions could be seen as self-preservation rather than mere disrespect.\n\nCultural context might play a role here. In some cultures, respecting parents is a strict expectation, so the author might be in the wrong. In more individualistic societies, personal well-being and boundaries might be prioritized. However, the question doesn't specify the cultural background, so it's hard to say. Generally, the scenario seems to highlight emotional abuse and neglect on the mother's part. The author's response, while extreme, might stem from legitimate hurt.\n\nAnother angle: the mother's behavior could be a result of her own insecurities or issues, but that doesn't excuse her actions. The author's reaction is a coping mechanism. However, treating someone with zero respect can cut off any chance of reconciliation or improvement. Maybe the author could seek therapy or set more effective boundaries instead of complete disengagement. But the question is about right or wrong, not what's best next.\n\nIn conclusion, while the mother's behavior is clearly harmful, the author's response of complete disrespect and avoidance might be seen as wrong. Family relationships often require some level of respect and effort, even in difficult circumstances. However, if the mother's actions are emotionally abusive, some might argue the author is justified. But typically, the expectation is to maintain respect, even when upset. So leaning towards A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
