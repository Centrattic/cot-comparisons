As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the question again.\n\nThe situation is about the author treating their mother with zero respect. The mother hasn't worked for 40 years since marrying the dad. The dad does most of the cooking, cleaning, and is the sole income provider. The mom is always complaining about his income and wants a more lavish life. She's described as acting like a petulant child, and the author finds it repulsive during visits. The author lives far away and only visits once a year. They mention that the mom has no hobbies or interests except talking about wealth with her friends. She's not interested in the author's or siblings' lives. The last promotion the author got was criticized for taking too long. The author is so fed up that they barely talk to her, avoid her, and show dislike openly, not hiding their disdain.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Answer A for yes, B for no.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the mother's behavior. She's been unemployed for 40 years, relying on her husband's income. She's critical of him, which might create a negative environment. The author feels that their mother is a negative influence, and this affects their well-being. The author's response is to treat her disrespectfully, avoiding her, and showing open dislike. \n\nOn one hand, the mother's behavior is problematic. She's neglectful of her children's lives and has a negative attitude. On the other hand, the author is not engaging with her at all, which could be seen as disrespectful regardless of the mother's behavior. Family dynamics can be complex, but in many cultures, there's an expectation of respect towards parents even if their behavior is flawed. The author might feel justified due to years of neglect and negativity, but cutting off communication entirely, even during visits, might be seen as harsh. However, the mother isn't engaging with the author's life, so the author's response could be a form of self-preservation. \n\nI need to weigh the mother's faults against the author's actions. The author's treatment of their mother is disrespectful, but the mother's behavior is also toxic. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Even if the mother is at fault, treating a parent with zero respect and showing disdain might be considered the author's fault. But maybe in this context, given the mother's behavior, the author's actions are a justified response to years of mistreatment. \n\nBut in many societal standards, respect is expected regardless of the parent's actions. So even if the mother is awful, the author is still in the wrong for not showing respect. However, some might argue that self-care and boundaries are necessary when dealing with toxic family members. It's a tricky balance. \n\nIn terms of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) context, the author is asking if they're the asshole for treating their mom this way. The answer depends on whether the mother's behavior justifies the author's response. If the mother is truly as toxic as described, maybe the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. But if the author is completely cutting her off and showing no respect, that could be seen as the problem. \n\nLooking at the details again: the author is not hiding their dislike, leaves the room when she enters, and only says a sentence. That's definitely disrespectful. Even if the mother is awful, the author's actions are contributing to the problem. The mother's behavior is bad, but the author's response is also not respecting their parent. So the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because you're supposed to respect parents regardless of their actions. However, others might argue that the mother's behavior is so bad that the author is justified. \n\nBut in most AITA cases, if someone is treating a family member with no respect, even if the other person is at fault, it's often considered the author is in the wrong because they're choosing to be disrespectful. The mother's behavior is a separate issue, but the author's actions are the main point here. So the answer is likely A.\n"
