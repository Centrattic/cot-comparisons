My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the given situation. The author is treating their mother with zero respect, avoiding interaction, and showing disdain during visits. The mother is described as not working, complaining about her husband's income, being negative, and not showing interest in the author's life.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014being negative, not contributing to the household, and not supporting her children. The author has valid reasons for feeling resentful. However, the way the author is handling it by completely cutting off interaction and showing contempt might be the issue. Even if the mother is difficult, treating someone with no respect can escalate the problem and is generally not advisable. The author might need to address the issues through setting boundaries respectfully rather than through hostility. So, while the mother is at fault in many ways, the author's approach is also harmful and not the right way to handle it. Therefore, the answer is A\u2014the author is in the wrong for their disrespectful behavior.\n"
