My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. The situation described is that the mother has been unemployed for 40 years since marrying the father, and now the father is the sole provider. The mother is portrayed as complaining about money, not interested in her children's lives, and the author feels resentful and avoids interacting with her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's mother is not working, which might be a cultural or personal choice, but the father is handling most household duties and finances. The mother's behavior is described as negative and dismissive towards the children. The author feels justified in their disrespectful behavior because they've had a bad experience over 20 years. \n\nBut then, from a societal or ethical standpoint, treating a parent with zero respect is generally considered wrong, regardless of the parent's behavior. Even if the mother is problematic, the child's response of completely ignoring her and showing disdain might be seen as disrespectful. The user's own perspective is that the author isn't wrong, but the question is whether they are in the wrong.\n\nI should think about the balance between valid grievances and respectful conduct. While the mother's actions are questionable, the author's approach of completely cutting off communication and showing disdain could be seen as a breach of family respect norms. However, cultural factors might influence this. In some cultures, filial piety is highly valued, and disrespect could be a major issue. In others, personal well-being might be prioritized. \n\nThe author's behavior is extreme\u2014leaving the room when she enters and not hiding their disdain. This could be seen as going too far, regardless of the mother's behavior. Even if the mother is difficult, maintaining some level of respect is usually expected, especially in family dynamics. The author's actions might harm family relationships further and set a poor example. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of mental health and well-being. If the mother's behavior is toxic and causing significant distress, the author might feel justified in protecting themselves. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not about the mother's behavior. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's treatment of their mother is disrespectful and harmful. Therefore, they are in the wrong, making the answer A.\n"
