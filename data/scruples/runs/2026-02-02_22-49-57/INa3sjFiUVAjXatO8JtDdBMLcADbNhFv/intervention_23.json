My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. The situation is pretty detailed.\n\nFirst, the mom hasn't worked in 40 years, and the dad is the sole provider. The mom is described as constantly complaining about the dad's income and being a \"petulant child.\" The author feels she's a negative influence, especially during visits. They mention she has no hobbies and only talks about wealth with friends. Also, she doesn't support the kids' lives, like criticizing a promotion instead of being happy. The author is now treating her with disdain, avoiding interaction, and even leaving the room when she enters.\n\nNow, considering the options: A (in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong). \n\nFrom the author's perspective, they've had a hard time putting up with their mom for 20 years, which is a long time. The mom's behavior is clearly toxic and negative. The author's response seems like a reaction to that toxicity. However, treating someone with zero respect isn't healthy either. But in this case, the author is standing up for themselves against someone who's been unkind and uninterested in their lives. \n\nI think the key here is the mom's behavior. If someone is consistently toxic and the child is reacting to that by protecting their mental health, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But there's also the aspect of family relationships and respecting parents. However, the mom isn't exactly being a supportive parent. The author's actions are a form of self-preservation. \n\nIn many cases, people with toxic parents do distance themselves, and while it's not ideal, it's a way to cope. So the author's behavior, while harsh, might be a justified response to the mother's actions. So I'm leaning towards B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
