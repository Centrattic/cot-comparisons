My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. The situation is that the mom hasn't worked since marrying the dad 40 years ago, and the dad is the sole provider. The mom complains about the dad's salary and lifestyle, and the author and their siblings feel neglected. The author now avoids interacting with the mom during visits and shows disdain.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The mom hasn't worked for 40 years, which might be a personal choice or societal expectations. The dad is handling most household duties and financials. The mom's behavior includes berating the dad and being uninterested in her children's lives. The author's response is to be disrespectful and avoid her.\n\nFrom a traditional perspective, respecting parents is important. But the mom's actions are causing significant emotional distress. The author's treatment is a reaction to constant negativity and lack of support. However, cutting her off completely might be extreme. The question is whether the author's actions are justified.\n\nPossible angles: The mom's behavior is toxic, but the author's response is also harmful. The dad's role is interesting\u2014maybe he's enabling her behavior. The author's justification is based on years of neglect and disrespect towards the father. But treating a parent with zero respect can have its own consequences, even if the parent is flawed.\n\nI should consider cultural norms, family dynamics, and the impact on relationships. Even if the mother is at fault, the author's approach might not be healthy. Maybe a more constructive way to handle it would be better. But the question is about being \"in the wrong\"\u2014if the mother's behavior is so bad that the author's reaction is understandable, then maybe not wrong. However, completely disengaging and showing contempt could still be seen as disrespectful regardless of the mom's actions. So the answer might be A (yes) because the author is still expected to maintain some level of respect, even if the mother is difficult. But others might argue it's self-care. Need to decide based on the context given.\n"
