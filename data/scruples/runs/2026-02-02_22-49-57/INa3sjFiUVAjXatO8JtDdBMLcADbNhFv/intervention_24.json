My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. The author's mother hasn't worked in 40 years since marrying their dad. The dad does most of the cooking, cleaning, and provides the sole income. The mom is described as complaining about money, being a \"petulant child,\" and not showing interest in the author's life. The author feels resentful and responds by being emotionally distant and disrespectful during visits.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother's behavior is clearly problematic. She's not working, relies on the husband's income, complains about not having enough, and isn't supportive of her children. The author's resentment is understandable given their upbringing. But the question is whether their disrespectful treatment is justified.\n\nOn one hand, the mother's behavior is toxic and could contribute to the author's negative feelings. On the other hand, the author's response\u2014completely cutting off communication, avoiding interaction, and showing open disdain\u2014might be considered disrespectful regardless of the mother's actions. Respect in a family context often involves maintaining some level of dignity and engagement, even if there are underlying issues. The author's approach could be seen as a form of emotional self-defense, but it might also be harming their relationship further.\n\nHowever, the mother's behavior is inexcusable. She's contributing to a toxic environment. The author's resentment is a result of long-term emotional neglect and criticism. In such cases, setting boundaries is important. But does that include treating her with zero respect? Maybe not. The author might need to find a way to disengage without being disrespectful, perhaps by limiting interactions or using neutral communication. But given the mother's behavior, the author's frustration is valid. The problem is that the author is choosing a confrontational approach that could be seen as disrespectful, even if the mother is at fault.\n\nIn family dynamics, respect is usually expected on both sides. However, the mother's actions are the root cause here. The author's actions, while perhaps understandable, are still disrespectful. It's a tricky situation because the mother's behavior is awful, but the author's response could also be unkind. The key is whether the author is justified in their treatment. While the mother's actions are worse, the author isn't entirely blameless in how they respond. But maybe in this context, the mother's behavior is so bad that the author's resentment is justified, even if their approach is not ideal. I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because the mother's actions are inexcusable, but the answer might depend on cultural expectations and what's considered respectful behavior in family relationships.\n"
