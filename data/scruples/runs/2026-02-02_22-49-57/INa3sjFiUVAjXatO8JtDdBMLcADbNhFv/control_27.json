My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. The situation involves the mother not working, the father handling most household duties and providing income, and the mother being critical and uninterested in the kids' lives. The author visits once a year and has become completely dismissive, even avoiding interaction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother hasn't worked for 40 years, which is a long time. The father is the sole provider, which might lead to an imbalance in the household. The mother's behavior seems negative\u2014complaining about money, not engaging with the kids, and being critical. The author feels resentment and is now treating their mom poorly during visits.\n\nThe question is about right or wrong. The author's actions are disrespectful, but the context is important. They've had negative experiences over 20 years, which might justify their feelings. However, cutting off communication entirely, even once a year visits, could be seen as extremes. The mother might still deserve some level of respect, regardless of her flaws.\n\nBut then again, the mother's behavior is clearly toxic. The author isn't in the wrong for feeling upset, but treating someone with zero respect is usually frowned upon. The answer might depend on cultural norms and personal boundaries. However, the author's approach is not healthy and could be seen as wrong because it's disrespectful and doesn't allow for any potential improvement in the relationship or communication. So maybe the answer is A (they're in the wrong), but I need to make sure I'm not overlooking the mother's faults.\n"
