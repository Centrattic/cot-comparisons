My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author treating their mother with zero respect because of her behavior and the mother's complaints about wealth, lack of interest in the author's life, and other negative traits.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The mother hasn't worked in 40 years, the father does most of the work and provides the income, the mother is critical and has no hobbies. The author feels resentful and has been avoiding interaction during visits, showing open disdain. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFrom a typical perspective, respect is generally expected in family relationships, even if there are issues. However, the mother's behavior is described as negative, with her criticizing the author and not showing interest in their lives. The author's response is to withhold respect and avoid engagement. \n\nBut is that justifiable? Well, the mother's actions are problematic, but how one responds to that can also be a factor. Treating someone with zero respect and showing open disdain might be seen as the wrong approach, even if the mother's behavior is poor. The author's approach could lead to more family conflict and might not resolve the underlying issues. However, the mother's behavior is also clearly harmful and disrespectful. \n\nIn many cases, experts suggest setting boundaries rather than completely cutting off or being disrespectful. The author's actions might be a form of self-preservation, but it's a delicate balance. The answer might depend on cultural norms as well, but generally, while the mother is at fault for her behavior, the author's lack of respect might be considered wrong as well. However, given the extreme descriptions, some might argue the author isn't in the wrong because the mother's actions are so harmful. \n\nLooking at similar \"Am I the Asshole\" scenarios, the common advice is to handle conflicts with more grace and boundaries rather than open hostility. So the author might be in the wrong for their response, even if the mother is the initial problem. But I need to be careful here. The mother's behavior is definitely contributing to the problem, but the author's response is not acceptable either. So the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because even if the mother is problematic, treating her with zero respect is not the right approach. The author should work on setting boundaries without being disrespectful, perhaps through less direct interactions or maintaining a polite distance without showing disdain.\n"
