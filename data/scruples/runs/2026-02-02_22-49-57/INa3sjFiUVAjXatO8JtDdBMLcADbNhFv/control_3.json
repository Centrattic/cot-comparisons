My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for treating their mother with no respect. The situation described is pretty intense. The mom hasn't worked in 40 years, the dad does most of the work and provides the income, and the mom is constantly complaining and negative. The author is so fed up that they avoid interacting with her, leave the room when she comes in, and show open disdain.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the mother's behavior. If she's been neglectful, negative, and uninterested in her children's lives, that's a problem. The author has a history of being mistreated, which might justify their resentment. But treating someone with zero respect is never okay, no matter the circumstances. The author's actions are extreme\u2014cutting off communication, showing contempt. Even if the mother is difficult, the way the author is handling it could be seen as disrespectful.\n\nHowever, there's a context of long-term emotional neglect. The author might be reacting to years of being put down. But in family dynamics, communication is key. Maybe the author hasn't tried to address the issues constructively. Instead, they're retaliating with silence and avoidance, which can be harmful. The mother might need to take responsibility for her behavior, but the author also has a role in how they respond. Disrespecting someone doesn't resolve the underlying issues and can damage relationships further. So while the mother's behavior is problematic, the author's approach is also not healthy. The right answer is probably A, the author is in the wrong because they're choosing to treat their mother disrespectfully instead of addressing the issues in a healthier way.\n"
