My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about how the author treats their mother. The author says their mom hasn't worked in 40 years since marrying their dad, who does most of the work and is the sole income. The mom is described as being critical of their dad's income and being a negative presence, especially during visits. The author responds by being disrespectful, avoiding interaction, and showing disdain.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother's behavior seems problematic\u2014no job, complaining, lack of interest in her children's lives. The father is the one working and doing most responsibilities. The author feels trapped in a negative environment when visiting, which is only once a year. They feel resentful and have chosen to withdraw emotionally and socially during visits.\n\nNow, the key question is whether the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. From a traditional standpoint, respecting parents is often emphasized, but this is a complex family situation. The mother's actions contribute to the problem: she's neglectful and negative. The author's response is a reaction to years of this behavior. However, even if someone is a terrible parent, intentionally showing disdain and avoiding interaction might not be considered respectful, regardless of the circumstances.\n\nBut the other side is that the author has been dealing with this negative environment for years. They might feel justified in their reaction due to the harm caused by the mother's behavior. However, cutting off communication or treating someone with disrespect could be seen as harmful, even if the other person is at fault. There might be a middle ground where the author could set boundaries without being openly disrespectful. But given the mother's behavior, the author's feelings are understandable.\n\nI need to balance the mother's faults against the author's actions. The mother's actions are definitely contributing to the problem, but the author's response is to treat her poorly. In many cultures, respecting parents is a key value, but if the parent is toxic, it's a more nuanced situation. The answer might depend on whether the author's actions are considered a reasonable response to the mother's behavior. However, even in toxic situations, completely cutting someone off or showing disdain might not be considered the right approach, but it's hard to say definitively.\n\nAnother angle is that the author is an adult and can make their own choices. But the question is about being \"in the wrong.\" If the mother is toxic, the author's actions might be a form of self-preservation. However, the author's approach could be seen as disrespectful. There's also the aspect of the author's relationship with their siblings and the father. The father is the one providing support, so maybe the author's resentment isn't entirely directed at the mother but the entire family dynamic.\n\nIn conclusion, while the mother's behavior is clearly problematic, the author's response of showing zero respect could be seen as wrong in terms of how they treat their mother. However, given the mother's role in creating the negative environment, there's a strong case that the author isn't entirely in the wrong. But the question is whether the author is \"in the wrong,\" so considering both sides, the answer might lean towards A (yes) because respect is expected, even if the mother is flawed. But I might be overcomplicating it. The user's example in the prompt might have a standard answer based on typical \"AITA\" trends where if someone is a terrible parent, the child's response is sometimes seen as justified. But in this case, the author's actions are extreme. So maybe the answer is A (they are in the wrong) because the author is choosing to treat their mother disrespectfully regardless of the mother's faults. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) because the mother's behavior is the root cause. I'm a bit torn, but leaning towards A because respect is a societal expectation, even in difficult family situations. So the answer would be A.\n"
