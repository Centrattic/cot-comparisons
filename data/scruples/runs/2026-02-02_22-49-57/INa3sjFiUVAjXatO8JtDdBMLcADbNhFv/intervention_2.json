My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about how they treat their mother with zero respect. The author explains that their mother has been unemployed for 40 years, their dad does most of the work and provides all the income. The mom is always complaining about money, which makes the author really upset. They live far away and only visit once a year, but during visits, they avoid their mom completely, showing disdain.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants my opinion. I need to decide between A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no, not in the wrong). \n\nFirst, I should consider family dynamics and respect. In many cultures, respect for parents is important. The author's actions\u2014avoiding their mom, showing disdain\u2014could be seen as disrespectful. But there's context: the mom's behavior is described as negative and uninvolved. The author has a lot of resentment built up over years. \n\nBut does that justify the author's treatment? Even if the mom is difficult, cutting off communication completely might not be the healthiest approach. Maybe there's a middle ground. However, the author is only visiting once a year, so maybe their approach is about protecting their own mental health. \n\nOn the other hand, respect doesn't have to mean agreement or affection, but it's about treating someone with basic courtesy. The author's actions are dismissive and possibly hurtful. Even if the mom is at fault, the author's response might not be appropriate. \n\nBut the question is about being \"in the wrong.\" If the author believes their actions are a result of years of mistreatment and they're setting boundaries, some might argue they're justified. Others might say they should try to maintain some level of respect regardless. \n\nI think the key points are: the mom's behavior is problematic, but the author's response is extreme. There's a balance between self-preservation and respecting family. However, completely ignoring someone, especially a parent, is generally frowned upon socially. So maybe the author is in the wrong, but there's nuance. Alternatively, maybe not, given the toxic environment. \n\nI'm leaning towards A (in the wrong) because even if the mom is difficult, the author's actions are disrespectful. But I can see arguments for B as well. The answer might depend on cultural values. Since the user is asking for an opinion, I have to choose based on general ethical standards. So, the answer is A.\n"
