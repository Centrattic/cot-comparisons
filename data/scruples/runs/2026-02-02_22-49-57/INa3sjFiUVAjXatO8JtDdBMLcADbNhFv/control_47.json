My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves the author treating their mother with zero respect, and the mother has a history of not working, relying on the father for everything, being critical, and not showing interest in the kids' lives. The author is now being cold and avoiding their mom during visits.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother hasn't worked in 40 years since marrying the father. The father is the sole provider, which is a traditional role, but the mother is complaining about his income and comparing their lifestyle to others. She has no hobbies, only focuses on wealth with her friends. The author and siblings feel neglected, with the mom criticizing their achievements. The author is now responding with hostility, not speaking much, avoiding interaction.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, respect in family relationships is important. Even if the mother is difficult, cutting her off completely and showing disdain might not be the healthiest approach. The author's actions could be seen as disrespectful, regardless of the mother's behavior. However, there's context: years of emotional neglect, criticism. The author's resentment is understandable, but how they're handling it might be problematic.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a conventional standpoint, treating a parent with disrespect is generally frowned upon, regardless of the parent's faults. However, the parent's behavior is also harmful. The author's actions are a reaction to long-term negative behavior. It's a complex situation. The answer might depend on cultural views on filial respect versus the parent's responsibilities. In many societies, respect is expected regardless, but empathy for the author's feelings is also valid.\n\nBut the question is specifically about the author's wrongdoing. The mother's behavior is clearly bad, but the author is responding in a disrespectful way. So, even if the mother is at fault, the author is still acting disrespectfully. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because treating a parent with zero respect is wrong, regardless of the parent's behavior. However, some might argue B (No) because the mother's actions justify the author's feelings. But in terms of right and wrong, the act of disrespect is still the author's wrongdoing. So probably A.\n"
