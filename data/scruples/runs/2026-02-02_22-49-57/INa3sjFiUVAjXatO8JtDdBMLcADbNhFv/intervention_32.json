My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The author is treating their mother with zero respect. The mother hasn't worked for 40 years, the dad is the sole provider, and the mother complains a lot, is petulant, and has no interest in her kids' lives. The author is now avoiding her during visits, being cold, and showing disdain.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and family norms. In many cultures, respect for parents is expected regardless of their behavior. The author's actions\u2014barely talking, leaving the room, showing open disdain\u2014might be seen as disrespectful. Even if the mother is difficult, the way the author is handling it could be harmful. It's possible that the author is justified in feeling resentment, but the response of complete disengagement and disrespect might be where they go wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother's behavior is clearly toxic and neglectful. She's criticized the kids, uninvolved, and has a negative attitude. The author has suffered for 20 years and is now trying to set boundaries. But is setting boundaries by completely cutting off communication and showing contempt the right approach? Maybe there's a middle ground where the author can maintain distance without being disrespectful. But the question is about being \"in the wrong.\" If the mother's behavior is awful, the author's resentment is understandable, but the way they're expressing it might still be wrong. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they're an adult now, living separately. They might not be obligated to interact, but outright disrespecting and showing hatred could be seen as wrong. The answer could be a mix, but the options are A or B. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but I need to decide. In many ethical frameworks, treating family with respect is important even if they're difficult. So maybe the author is in the wrong (A). But if the mother's behavior is so bad that the author can't handle it any other way, then B might be the answer. However, the author's approach is still disrespectful regardless of the mother's faults. So I might lean towards A.\n"
