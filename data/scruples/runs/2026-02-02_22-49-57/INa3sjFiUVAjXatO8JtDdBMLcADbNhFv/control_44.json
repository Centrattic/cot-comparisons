My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether treating their mother with zero respect is justified given the situation described.\n\nFirst, the user explains that their mom hasn't worked in 40 years since marrying their dad. The dad is the sole provider and does most of the household chores. The mom is critical of his income and complains about not having a lavish lifestyle. She's described as acting like a \"petulant child\" and being negative. The author is tired of this and only visits once a year. They mention that their mom isn't interested in their or their siblings' lives, and when the author got a promotion, the mom criticized them for taking too long. Now, the author is being distant, avoiding interactions, and showing disdain during visits. The author claims they're done with the negativity and don't want to cater to their mom's behavior anymore.\n\nSo, the user is asking if they're at fault for treating their mom this way. The key points here are the mom's behavior, the history of neglect from the mom, and the author's response. \n\nOn one hand, the author's mom's behavior is certainly problematic. She's not working, is critical of her husband's income, lacks hobbies, and doesn't support her children. The author has a valid reason for feeling upset and frustrated. However, the author's response is to treat their mother with zero respect, avoid interaction, and show open disdain. Even if the mom is difficult, completely cutting off communication and showing disrespect could be seen as a harmful reaction. \n\nIn many cultures, there's an expectation to maintain respect towards parents regardless of their behavior. But there's also a balance between respecting someone and enabling toxic behavior. The author's approach might be a form of self-preservation, especially given their history of negative interactions. However, completely disengaging might not be the healthiest or most constructive approach. The author might be in a justified position given the mom's actions, but treating someone with zero respect isn't typically considered appropriate, even if they've been difficult. There's a difference between setting boundaries and actively showing disdain. The answer hinges on whether the author's response is proportionate and respectful. Since the author is being disrespectful, even if justified by the mom's behavior, the answer could lean towards the author being in the wrong. But some might argue that after years of abuse, the author's response is understandable. So the decision is tricky between A and B.\n"
