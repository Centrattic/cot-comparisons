My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to understand the details.\n\nThe author is asking if they're the asshole for treating their mom with zero respect. Their mom hasn't worked since marrying their dad 40 years ago. The dad is the sole provider, doing most of the cooking and cleaning. The mom constantly complains about the dad's income and her lifestyle, acts like a petulant child, and has no real hobbies or interest in the author or their siblings' lives. The author finds her repulsive, especially during visits, and now they barely talk to her, avoid her, and show disdain. They've been putting up with her for 20 years until moving out, but visits still leave them in a bad mood.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the mother's behavior. She's not working, relying on her husband's income, and seems to belittle him by criticizing his earnings. She's dismissive of her children's achievements and has a negative attitude. That's pretty toxic. The author's actions are a response to years of this behavior. They're not hiding their disdain, which is clearly disrespectful.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, respecting family can be a social norm, but if the mother has been toxic and unloving, the author's resentment is understandable. However, treating someone with zero respect can be hurtful regardless of the reasons. The key is whether the author's actions are justified.\n\nThe mother's behavior is definitely problematic, but the author's response is also extreme. Disrespecting someone, even if they're difficult, might not be the healthiest way to handle it. Maybe the author is justified in their feelings but not in their actions. However, if the mother has been neglectful and negative for so long, the author's frustration is valid. \n\nIt's a tough call. On one hand, you have a parent who's been unkind and uninvolved. On the other, the author's response is cutting off communication and showing hatred. It's possible both are at fault in their own ways. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author's actions are a direct result of the mother's behavior, maybe they aren't entirely in the wrong. But they could have handled it better. Still, the core issue is the mother's behavior. So the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong, because their disrespect is a reaction to the mother's years of poor behavior.\n"
