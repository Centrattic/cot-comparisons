My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. The situation is pretty detailed.\n\nFirst, the author describes their mother as someone who hasn't worked in 40 years, relying on their father's income. The mother is apparently critical of him for not earning more and complains about her lifestyle. The author finds her behavior repulsive, especially during visits. They mention that the mother has no hobbies, only focuses on wealth and gossip with other women, and isn't interested in the author's or their siblings' lives. The author's response is to avoid interaction, leave the room when she enters, and not hide their disdain. They've been dealing with this for 20 years before moving out.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong. Let's break it down. On one hand, the mother's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014neglectful, critical, self-centered. The author's resentment is understandable given the long-term exposure to such behavior. On the other hand, the author is treating their mother with disrespect, which could be seen as a failure to maintain some level of respect regardless of the mother's actions. But cultural norms vary here. Some might argue that respect is earned, not just given, especially if the mother isn't showing any care or support. Others might say that even if the mother is terrible, the child should still show respect. However, the author's actions are a reaction to years of neglect and criticism. The mother's behavior has likely contributed to the author's feelings. It's possible that the author isn't \"in the wrong\" because their actions stem from a place of justified frustration. But maybe there's a more constructive way to handle it, like setting boundaries while still showing minimal respect. However, the question is about being in the wrong. If society or moral standards consider respect towards parents as a duty, then the author might be wrong. But if respect is reciprocal, then they're not. Given the context, the mother's behavior is inexcusable, so the author's resentment is valid. Therefore, the answer leans towards B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
