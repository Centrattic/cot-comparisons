My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. The scenario describes a mother who hasn't worked for 40 years and relies on her husband, who provides the income. The mother constantly complains about not having enough money and isn't interested in her children's lives. The author, after moving out, visits once a year but is rude, ignores her, and leaves the room when she enters. They feel entitled to do this because of their mother's behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014she's been dependent on her husband, complains about wealth, and shows little interest in her children's lives. The author's resentment is understandable, but treating someone with zero respect, especially a family member, could be seen as crossing a line. However, the mother's actions might have justified the author's feelings.\n\nThe key points here are the mother's behavior over the years and the author's response. While the mother's actions are inconsiderate, the author's response could be seen as disrespectful. But given the context of years of neglect and negativity, some might argue the author is within their rights to set boundaries. However, cutting off completely or being openly disrespectful might not be considered the best approach, even if the mother is difficult. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. In many cultures, there's an expectation to treat family with some level of respect, regardless of their actions. But the mother's behavior is toxic, so the author's response could be a form of self-preservation. \n\nI need to consider if the author's actions are a reasonable response. The mother's behavior is harmful, but the author's actions might be seen as extreme. However, the author is an adult and has the right to set boundaries. The answer might hinge on whether the author's response is proportionate. While the mother is at fault for her behavior, the author's complete lack of respect could still be considered wrong. However, given the context, some might say the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nBut in terms of right and wrong, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the mother's behavior is so toxic that the author can't engage without being harmful to themselves, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But others might say that even if the mother is difficult, the author should try to be respectful. The answer could be B (not in the wrong), but I need to make sure. It's a bit of a judgment call. \n\nIn summary, the mother's behavior is clearly problematic, and the author's response is a reaction to that. However, completely cutting off and showing no respect might be seen as inconsiderate, but given the context, the author might not be in the wrong. So I think the answer is B.\n"
