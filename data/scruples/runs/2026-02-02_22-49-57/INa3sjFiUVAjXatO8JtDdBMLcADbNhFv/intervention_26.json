My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author treating their mother with no respect. The mother is described as not working, constantly criticizing her husband for not earning enough, and being negative towards the author and their siblings. The author is so fed up that they avoid interacting with her during visits.\n\nFirst, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but I need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, the author's mother has some issues\u2014neglecting her family's well-being, being verbally critical, and having no interests beyond wealth. The father is handling most of the household responsibilities. The author's resentment is understandable given the environment they grew up in.\n\nOn the other hand, treating someone with zero respect and avoiding interaction entirely could be seen as going too far. Even if the mother is difficult, some people might argue that maintaining a basic level of respect and politeness is necessary, especially in family situations. However, others might say that the mother's behavior is toxic, and the author is justified in setting boundaries.\n\nI should consider cultural norms. In many cultures, there's an expectation to respect parents regardless of their behavior. But if the mother is emotionally abusive, that's a different angle. The author mentions being in a bad mood after visits and not hiding their disdain. That could be seen as harsh, but the mother's actions have been a long-term stressor.\n\nThe author's actions might be a form of self-preservation. If the mother's behavior is draining their emotional energy, choosing to limit interaction could be a valid coping mechanism. However, completely cutting off communication might not be the healthiest approach either, but the context shows it's once a year, so maybe it's manageable.\n\nI think the key points are the mother's behavior being toxic and the author's response as a form of self-protection. While the author could try to engage more politely to avoid further conflict, their actions are a reaction to long-standing issues. So the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
