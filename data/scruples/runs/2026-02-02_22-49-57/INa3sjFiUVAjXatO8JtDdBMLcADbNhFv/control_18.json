My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is treating their mother with zero respect, not talking to her, avoiding her, and showing disdain. The mother has been staying at home for 40 years, the father is the sole provider, and the mother is described as complaining and negative. The author feels like they've had a bad experience with their mom and can't stand visiting her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother hasn't worked since marrying the father, which might be part of the issue. The father does most of the work, and the mother is seen as critical and uninterested in her children's lives. The author is reacting to years of negative behavior by treating their mom poorly.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, respect is generally expected in family relationships, even if the other person is difficult. Disrespecting a parent could be seen as wrong, regardless of their behavior. However, the mother's actions are also problematic\u2014being critical, uninvolved, and negative. The author's response is a reaction to that environment they've been in for 20 years.\n\nCultural context matters here. In many cultures, showing disrespect to parents is frowned upon. But the mother's behavior is also contributing to a toxic environment. The author might be justified in trying to avoid negative interactions, but the way they handle it\u2014openly showing disdain and avoiding all contact\u2014could be seen as disrespectful.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they live across the country and visit once a year. Maybe they're trying to minimize time spent with a difficult parent, but their approach is aggressive. It's a balance between self-preservation and maintaining respect. The answer might depend on whether the author's actions are seen as a justified self-defense against a toxic parent or if they're overreacting and being disrespectful.\n\nI think there's a case for both sides. The mother's behavior is clearly problematic, but the author's response is not respectful. However, given the mother's long-term negative behavior and the author's attempts to protect their mental health, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong. But I'm not sure. Maybe the right approach is to recognize that while the mother is at fault, the author's response is still not appropriate, making them partially in the wrong. But the question is whether they're in the wrong entirely. The answer might be B (No), because the mother's behavior is the root cause, and the author is reacting to that, but maybe the answer is A (Yes) because they shouldn't treat their mom that way regardless. Hmm.\n"
