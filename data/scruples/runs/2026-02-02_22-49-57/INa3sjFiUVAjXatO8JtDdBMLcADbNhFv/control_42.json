My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the question is about whether treating their mother with zero respect is acceptable given the situation they described.\n\nFirst, the user's mother hasn't had a job for 40 years since marrying their dad. The dad is the sole provider, doing most of the cooking and cleaning. The mom is constantly criticizing the dad for not earning more and is described as acting like a petulant child. She's focused on wealth, has no hobbies, and doesn't seem interested in her kids' lives. The last promotion the author got was met with criticism from their mom about taking too long. The author only visits once a year because they live far away, and during those visits, they interact minimally, avoid the mom, and openly express disdain. The author is 20 years old now, implying they moved out at 20. They're tired of the negativity and don't want to hide their dislike anymore.\n\nNow, the question is if the author is wrong for treating their mom this way. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nTo decide, I need to consider the context. The author's behavior is a response to what they perceive as their mother's negative behavior. The mother's actions are described as critical, self-centered, and dismissive of her children's achievements. The author feels that their mother doesn't care about their lives and is a negative influence. They've been dealing with this for 20 years and now express their disdain when visiting once a year.\n\nHowever, even if the mother is difficult, the author's choice to engage in disrespectful behavior\u2014like avoiding her entirely, not talking, and showing open disdain\u2014could be problematic. Respect is generally expected in family relationships regardless of the other person's actions. Even if someone is difficult, lashing out or cutting someone off completely might not be considered the right approach. The author might be justifying their behavior because of their mother's actions, but in terms of moral responsibility, they might still be in the wrong for how they treat their mother. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the mother's behavior is so toxic that the author is justified in setting boundaries. The key point here is whether the author's response is proportionate. The author isn't cutting off contact entirely but is limiting interaction during annual visits. They mention only visiting once a year, so maybe their minimal interaction is a boundary to protect their mental health. In that case, it might not be entirely their fault.\n\nBut the question is about being \"in the wrong.\" In many cultural contexts, showing disrespect to a parent is generally considered wrong regardless of the parent's behavior. However, if the parent's behavior is abusive or toxic, the child might have valid reasons for setting boundaries. The challenge is balancing the mother's behavior against the child's response. The author's actions, while hurtful, might be a way to cope with a difficult situation. \n\nI think there's a middle ground here. The author's behavior is a reaction to long-term mistreatment, but the way they're handling it might be seen as disrespectful. However, in some cases, people might empathize with the author's need to protect their own well-being. It's a nuanced situation. If the mother is genuinely abusive, the author might not be entirely at fault. But if the mother's behavior, while unpleasant, isn't abusive, then the author's response might be excessive. \n\nGiven the description, the mother is critical, self-centered, and dismissive, but there's no mention of physical abuse or overtly malicious intent. The author's actions could be seen as a way to avoid further harm to themselves. However, the act of treating a parent with zero respect is typically frowned upon. The answer might depend on cultural norms and how the situation is perceived. If the community values filial respect highly, the author is in the wrong. If it's more about mutual respect and boundaries, maybe not. \n\nGiven that the author is only visiting once a year and trying to protect their mental health, perhaps the answer is B (not in the wrong). But I'm a bit torn because the question is about whether they are in the wrong. The mother's behavior isn't excusable, but the author's response might be a justified boundary. However, the outright disdain and minimal interaction could still be seen as disrespectful. So maybe the answer is A. Hmm. This is tricky.\n"
