My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the mother hasn't worked since marrying the dad 40 years ago. The dad is the sole provider, doing most of the cooking and cleaning. The mom is described as complaining about his salary, being petulant, and not interested in the kids' lives. The author feels resentful, especially after moving out, and now treats the mother with disdain during visits. They avoid interaction, leave the room, and openly show hatred.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. But I need to consider both sides. The mother's behavior sounds toxic and possibly entitled. She's not contributing and is critical. However, children are generally expected to show respect to parents regardless of the parents' flaws. The author's actions are disrespectful and could be seen as emotionally abusive. Even if the mother is difficult, treating her with zero respect might not be justified. Maybe the author should address the issues without being disrespectful. So, while the mother's behavior is problematic, the author's approach is still wrong. Answer A.\n"
