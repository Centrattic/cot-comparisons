My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking for a judgment based on the situation described. The author is upset with their mother, who they feel hasn't contributed to the family financially, is critical, and uninterested in their lives. The author's response is to treat their mother with zero respect, avoid interaction, and even leave the room when she's around.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the mother's behavior. She hasn't worked since marrying the father 40 years ago, and the father is the sole provider. She complains about his income and lifestyle, which could be seen as ungrateful or difficult. The author mentions that she has no hobbies or interests beyond discussing wealth with friends, which might indicate a lack of personal fulfillment or empathy. Also, she's critical of the author's achievements, which is hurtful.\n\nHowever, the author's response is to completely cut her off during visits, showing disdain. While the mother's behavior is problematic, the author's actions might be seen as disrespectful and potentially harmful. Family dynamics are complex, and even if one person is at fault, completely cutting them off without communication might not be the healthiest approach. There might be other ways to set boundaries without being disrespectful. Also, the author's approach could escalate tensions and hurt the mother, especially if she's not aware of the depth of the issue. The mother might not realize how her actions affect others.\n\nBut then, the author has been putting up with this for 20 years. The emotional toll is significant, and they only visit once a year. The question is whether the author's reaction is justified given the mother's behavior. The mother's lack of support and constant criticism could be seen as contributing factors. However, treating someone with zero respect, even if they're difficult, is generally considered wrong. There's a balance between self-respect and respect for others, even family members. The author might need to find a middle ground, but the current approach is extreme.\n\nIn summary, while the mother's behavior is definitely problematic, the author's choice to treat her with zero respect and avoid interaction entirely could be seen as the wrong approach. There might be a case for the author to seek a more constructive way to handle the situation rather than complete disengagement and disrespect.\n"
