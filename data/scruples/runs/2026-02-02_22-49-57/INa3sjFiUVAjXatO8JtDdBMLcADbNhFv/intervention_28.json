My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. Let me start by breaking down the details given.\n\nThe mother hasn't worked since marrying the father 40 years ago. The father is the sole provider, doing most of the cooking and cleaning. The mother constantly complains about his income and her lifestyle not being lavish enough. The author finds this behavior repulsive, especially during visits. The mother has no hobbies and only talks about wealth with her friends. She's dismissive of the author's and siblings' lives, and her comments are negative. The author, after 20 years of this, is now cutting the mother off during visits, avoiding conversation, and showing clear disdain.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author is upset with the mother's behavior, which seems to be chronic and negative. The mother's actions could be perceived as ungrateful and emotionally neglectful. The author is an adult, living away, and their response is to minimize contact, which could be seen as self-preservation.\n\nOn the other hand, respect is generally expected in family relationships, even if the other person is difficult. The author's approach of complete disengagement might be seen as disrespectful or harsh. However, the mother's behavior has been toxic for years, and the author's actions could be a response to ongoing mistreatment. It's a balance between personal boundaries and familial obligations.\n\nI should also consider cultural norms. In some cultures, showing disrespect to parents is a serious issue. But the question is more about moral judgment rather than legal or cultural. The key points are the mother's behavior being toxic and the author's defensive response. The author's actions are a result of years of stress and neglect, so maybe they're not entirely at fault. However, completely cutting off communication could be seen as extreme. But given the context, it might be a necessary step for their well-being.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The mother's behavior is problematic, but the author's response could be seen as valid self-care. On the other hand, some might argue that even negative people deserve basic respect. I think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the mother's actions are harmful, and the author is protecting their mental health. However, there's a nuance here. Maybe the author isn't in the wrong, but there's a chance they could be, depending on how one views family dynamics. But given the description, I think B is the answer.\n"
