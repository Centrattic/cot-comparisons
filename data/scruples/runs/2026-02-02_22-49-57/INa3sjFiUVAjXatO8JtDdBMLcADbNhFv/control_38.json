My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. The situation is that the mother hasn't worked since marrying the father 40 years ago, and the dad does most of the work. The mother complains a lot, is negative, and the author is really fed up, so they're being disrespectful during visits.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014she's critical, has no hobbies, and doesn't support her children. But the author's response is to completely ignore her, avoid interaction, and show disdain. That's harsh. Even if the mother is difficult, treating someone with zero respect isn't right. Family relationships are complex, and while the mother's actions are hurtful, the author's reaction might be seen as crossing a line. It's important to address the issue but in a respectful way. Maybe the author should express their feelings without being disrespectful. So, the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong because disrespects their mother, even if she's awful. However, some might argue B, considering the mother's behavior. But generally, the expectation is to handle conflict respectfully. So leaning towards A.\n"
