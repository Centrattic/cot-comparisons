My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. The situation described is pretty intense.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The mother hasn't worked since marrying the dad 40 years ago. The dad handles most of the household responsibilities and is the sole income provider. The mother constantly complains about his salary and the lifestyle, acting petulantly. The author visits once a year and ends up in a bad mood because of her behavior. The author now barely talks to her, leaves the room when she enters, and openly shows disdain.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI should consider the mother's actions. If she's berating the father and not supporting him, that's problematic. Also, not showing interest in her children's lives and being critical of their achievements can be harmful. The author's resentment is understandable given the 20 years of exposure before moving out. But does that justify treating the mother without respect?\n\nFamily dynamics can be complex. The author might have a valid reason to feel upset, but cutting someone off completely, even with bad behavior, might not be the healthiest approach. However, the mother's behavior is clearly toxic. The author's actions are a form of self-preservation. \n\nBut is it right to treat someone with zero respect? The mother is still a parent, and while her behavior is awful, the author's response could be seen as disrespectful. But the mother's actions might have contributed to the author's feelings. The key here is understanding the context. The mother is not meeting basic familial expectations, and the author is reacting to years of negativity. \n\nI think the answer is B (no), because the mother's behavior is the root cause of the author's resentment. The author is not wrong for feeling this way, especially considering the lack of support and the toxic environment. However, the approach of complete disengagement might not be the best, but the question is about being in the wrong, not about the best solution. So, the author's actions are a reaction to the mother's poor behavior, which could make the author not in the wrong. But maybe there's an expectation to maintain some level of respect regardless. \n\nAlternatively, even if the mother is at fault, the author's complete lack of respect might be considered wrong. But the mother's behavior is so bad that the author's response is somewhat justified. \n\nI need to decide based on the information given. The mother is the one with toxic behavior, so the author isn't in the wrong for reacting. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
