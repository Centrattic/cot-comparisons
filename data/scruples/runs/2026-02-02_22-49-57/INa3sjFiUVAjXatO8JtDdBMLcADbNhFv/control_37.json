My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. Let me break down the details given.\n\nThe author's mother hasn't worked since marrying the father 40 years ago. The father does most of the cooking, cleaning, and provides all the income. The mother constantly berates the father for not making more money and complains about her lifestyle. She's described as acting like a petulant child, with no hobbies besides talking about wealth with other women. The author and siblings feel neglected, with the mother showing no real interest in their lives. The author mentions a recent promotion was met with criticism for taking too long. The author now visits once a year, lives far away, and during visits, they barely talk to their mom, avoid her, and openly express dislike, which is causing them to feel bad.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for their disrespectful behavior. Let's consider both sides.\n\nFirst, the mother's behavior: she's been criticized for her actions. She's not contributing to the household, is complaining constantly, not interested in her children's lives, and has a negative attitude. If someone's parent is this toxic, it's understandable that the child might feel hurt and withdraw. However, treating a parent with zero respect and avoiding them entirely might be seen as harsh, even if the parent is difficult.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has endured this for 20 years, moved out, and only visits once a year. The mother's behavior is ongoing and negative. The author's response is to minimize contact and show disdain. While it's not acceptable to treat someone with complete disrespect, especially a family member, the mother's actions might have justified the author's feelings. However, the author's approach might be seen as extreme and not the most constructive way to handle the situation. They could be in the wrong if their actions are harmful or disrespectful, even if the mother is at fault. But maybe not, since they're responding to years of neglect and negativity.\n\nIt's a bit of a grey area. Some might argue that respect should be given regardless, while others might see it as self-preservation. The key point is whether the author's actions are justified given the mother's behavior. If the mother's actions are truly as harmful as described, the author might not be entirely in the wrong. But the way they're handling it could be problematic. However, since the question is binary (A or B), I need to choose. The mother's behavior is definitely toxic, but the author's response is also disrespectful. So maybe the author is in the wrong because they're treating their mother poorly, even if the mother is difficult. But others might say they're protecting their mental health. Hmm. Not sure, but I think the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong because they're being disrespectful regardless of the mother's faults. However, some might argue B. I need to decide based on typical perspectives. In many cases, even if the parent is problematic, the child is still expected to show some respect. So the answer is A.\n"
