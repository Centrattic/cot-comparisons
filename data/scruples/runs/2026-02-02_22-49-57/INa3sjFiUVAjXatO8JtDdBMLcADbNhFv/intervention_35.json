My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking for an opinion on whether treating their mother with zero respect is acceptable. The story describes the mother as someone who hasn't worked since marrying the father, relies on him for everything, complains a lot, and isn't supportive of her children. The author has been moving out of the way to avoid her and shows clear disdain.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mother's behavior is toxic and neglectful. She doesn't contribute to the household, complains about the father's income, and isn't supportive of her children's achievements. The author has been dealing with this for years and is now avoiding her. \n\nBut is treating a parent with zero respect ever justified? Respect is often seen as a moral obligation, regardless of the parent's actions. Even if the mother is difficult, completely cutting her off or showing no respect might be considered wrong. The author's actions could be seen as a form of self-preservation, but from a societal or ethical standpoint, disrespecing a parent might be frowned upon.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother's behavior is clearly harmful. The author's resentment is understandable, and they're taking steps to protect their own well-being. In some cultures, filial piety is very important, but in others, there's more emphasis on personal boundaries. The question is whether the author's response is proportionate to the mother's behavior. \n\nThe author is not engaging in harmful actions but is avoiding interaction and showing disdain. This might be a way to protect themselves, but the question is whether they are in the wrong. If the mother's behavior is toxic, maybe the author isn't wrong for not engaging. However, completely cutting off or showing zero respect might still be seen as wrong in many contexts. \n\nI think the answer depends on the cultural and ethical standards applied. If we go by the idea that respect is required regardless, then the author is in the wrong. If we consider that the mother's actions justify the author's response, then they aren't. The story says the author is \"not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore.\" That level of open disdain might be considered disrespectful, even if the mother is at fault. So, maybe the answer is A (in the wrong), but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, if the mother's behavior is so bad that the author's response is justified, then B (not in the wrong). But I need to decide based on the information given.\n"
