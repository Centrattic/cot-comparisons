My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. The situation is pretty detailed.\n\nFirst, the mom hasn't worked in 40 years since marrying the dad. The dad is the sole provider, doing most of the cooking and cleaning. The mom is critical of his income, complains about their lifestyle not being lavish, and is described as a petulant child. She has no hobbies or interests beyond talking about wealth with friends (who are other women in the neighborhood). The author and siblings feel neglected, with the author's promotion being criticized instead of supported. The author now avoids interacting with their mom during visits, leaving the room when she enters, and shows open disdain. They're asking if the author is in the wrong.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants opinions. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nI need to consider ethical perspectives, family dynamics, and respect. On one hand, showing disrespect to a parent is generally frowned upon in many cultures. The author is cutting their mother off completely, which could be seen as harsh. But on the other hand, the mother's behavior is described as toxic\u2014constant criticism, lack of support, and being a negative influence. The author's actions might be a reaction to years of mistreatment. \n\nBut is it right to treat someone with zero respect, regardless of their actions? Maybe the author should have set boundaries without complete silence. However, if the mother is toxic and the author is protecting their mental health, that's understandable. \n\nThe key points are the mother's behavior being harmful and the author's response as self-preservation. While the author's actions might be justified in some contexts, the question is whether they're in the wrong. If the mother is abusive, the author isn't wrong for distancing themselves. However, the way they treat her (disrespect, avoidance) might still be considered wrong by societal standards. \n\nBut the situation is complex. The answer might depend on cultural norms and personal ethics. Since the user is asking from a general perspective, I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the mother's behavior is toxic, and the author's actions are a response to that. However, some might argue that respect is still expected regardless. But given the context, the author's actions can be seen as self-protection.\n"
