My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about how they treat their mother.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The mother hasn't worked in 40 years since marrying the dad. The dad is the sole breadwinner, does most of the cooking and cleaning. The mother is described as constantly complaining about money, acting petulant, and not showing interest in the children's lives. The author feels resentment, treats the mom with zero respect during visits, avoids her, and openly shows disdain.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants my opinion. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nHmm. Traditionally, there's an expectation to respect family, but there's also the consideration of how the mother has behaved. The author's actions are extreme\u2014avoiding, showing hatred. But the mother's behavior is also problematic. The author has a right to set boundaries, but the way they're handling it might be harsh. However, they mention being in a bad mood for 20 years and only visiting once a year. Maybe they feel justified.\n\nI need to balance respecting family vs. self-care. While the mother isn't perfect, the author's approach is disrespectful. But maybe the mother's behavior warrants it. But in terms of being \"in the wrong,\" the author's treatment of the mother is disrespectful regardless of the mother's actions. So the answer might be A. But some might argue B because the mother's behavior justifies it. However, the question is if the author is in the wrong. Even if the mother is awful, treating her with zero respect is not justified. So the answer is A.\n"
