My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The story is about someone who treats their mother with zero respect because of her behavior. The mother hasn't worked in 40 years, relies on the father's income, is critical of him, and has no interest in the author's life. The author feels resentful and has been ignoring their mother during visits.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural context. In many cultures, respecting one's parents is a key value. However, the mother's behavior here is described as negative and uninvolved. The author's actions are a reaction to years of neglect and criticism. But does that justify treating her with no respect? \n\nOn one hand, the author has valid reasons for feeling upset. The mother's lack of support and constant negativity could be hurtful. The author might feel justified in their actions as a form of self-preservation. On the other hand, cutting someone out completely, even a parent, can be seen as disrespectful regardless of the reasons. \n\nI should also think about the impact on family dynamics. The author's behavior might affect their siblings and the father. Disrespecting a parent can lead to long-term family rifts. However, if the mother's behavior is toxic, the author might feel they have no choice but to set boundaries.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions are considered disrespectful. The story mentions avoiding interaction, leaving the room, and showing disdain. While the reasons are understandable, the actions themselves cross into disrespect. Even if the mother is difficult, responding with zero respect might not be the right approach. The correct answer might be A, but there's a nuance. Alternatively, some might argue B based on the mother's behavior. But generally, the expected social norm is to treat family members with some level of respect, even if they're difficult. So the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
