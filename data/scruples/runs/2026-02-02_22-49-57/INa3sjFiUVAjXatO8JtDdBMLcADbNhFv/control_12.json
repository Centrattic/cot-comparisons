My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again. The person is asking if they're the asshole for treating their mom with zero respect. Their mom hasn't worked since marrying their dad 40 years ago. The dad is the sole provider and does most of the cooking and cleaning. The mom complains about money and her lifestyle, acts like a petulant child, and isn't interested in the author's life. The author is so fed up that they barely talk to her when visiting, avoid her, and show disdain.\n\nFirst, I should consider the dynamics here. The mom hasn't worked in 40 years, relying on the dad's income. That's a long time. The dad is handling most household responsibilities, which is a lot. The mom's behavior is described as constant complaining, criticizing, and being negative. The author has only visited once a year, which is a long time to be around someone who's toxic. They mention that the mom's only comment on a promotion was a criticism, which shows a lack of support. The author is now cutting her off completely during visits by not talking and leaving the room. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, the mom is a negative force, and they've had 20 years of this before moving out. They're trying to protect their own mental health by avoiding interaction. But is treating a parent with zero respect ever acceptable? There's a cultural aspect here. In many societies, respecting parents is a big deal, even if they're not perfect. The author's actions could be seen as disrespectful, but their reasoning is based on the mom's behavior being harmful.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom's behavior is indeed problematic. She's not working, relying on her husband, and has no hobbies. She's dismissive of her children's achievements and is a constant source of negativity. The author's response is a form of self-preservation. However, cutting off completely might be seen as going too far, even if the mom is difficult. Maybe there's a middle ground where the author can set boundaries without complete disrespect.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, no. Ethically, it's more complex. The mom's behavior is toxic, but the author's response is also not ideal. The author is an adult, so their responsibility might be less, but the act of showing no respect and avoiding them entirely could be seen as wrong, depending on cultural norms. However, if the mom's behavior is abusive or emotionally harmful, the author's actions are a form of protecting themselves. \n\nIn many cases, people in the AITA situations where they're dealing with toxic family members are often told they're justified in setting boundaries, even if their methods are harsh. The key is whether the author's actions are proportionate. The mom's behavior is clearly negative, and the author is suffering from it. So maybe the answer is that the author isn't in the wrong because they're protecting their mental health from a toxic parent. But some might argue that respect is still necessary regardless of the parent's actions. It's a tough call, but leaning towards B (not in the wrong) because the mom's behavior is so problematic and the author is an adult who's setting necessary boundaries.\n"
