My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The author is treating their mother with zero respect, avoiding her during visits, and showing disdain. They mention their mom hasn't worked in 40 years, their dad handles most responsibilities, and the mother is critical and negative. The author feels this way after 20 years of putting up with her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that their mother is difficult and uninvolved in their life, leading to frustration. However, the mother's behavior, while perhaps unkind, might have her own reasons\u2014maybe she's unhappy or has unmet needs. The author's response, though, is to completely cut her off and show open disdain, which is disrespectful regardless of the mother's actions.\n\nRespect is important in relationships, even if the other person is difficult. While the mother may have flaws, treating someone with zero respect isn't justified. The author could be addressing the issues through other means, like setting boundaries or seeking family therapy, instead of completely cutting her out. The fact that the author lives far away might reduce daily conflict but doesn't negate the need for respectful interaction when visiting.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014neglecting her children's achievements, being critical, and having no interests. The author's emotional response is understandable, but the way they handle it is extreme. The key here is whether the author's actions are proportionate. Disrespectful behavior can harm family relationships further and might prevent any possibility of improvement.\n\nSo, while the mother has issues, the author's approach is not the right way to handle it. They should seek to address the problems constructively rather than with contempt. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
