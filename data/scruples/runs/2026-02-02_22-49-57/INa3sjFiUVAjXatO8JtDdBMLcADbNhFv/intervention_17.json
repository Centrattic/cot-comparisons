My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for treating their mom with zero respect. The story is about the author's mom who hasn't worked in 40 years, relies on the dad for everything, is critical of him, and doesn't support her kids. The author is so fed up that they avoid interacting with her, even showing disdain.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mom's behavior is clearly problematic. She's not contributing to the household, is constantly negative, and doesn't support her children. The author hasn't had a good relationship for 20 years and is now cutting her out completely. But is the author in the wrong?\n\nOn one hand, the author's mom is being unreasonable and toxic. The author's resentment is understandable. On the other hand, the author is choosing to treat their mother with disrespect, which can be hurtful. Family relationships are complex, and while the mom's actions are bad, completely disengaging might not be the healthiest approach. However, the author is an adult and has the right to set boundaries. If the mom is toxic, it's reasonable to limit contact or be distant. So maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But does the author's approach go too far? They're not even trying to hide their disdain. That could be seen as harsh. But given the mom's behavior, maybe it's justified. I think the key here is that the author is setting boundaries due to long-term abuse. So the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
