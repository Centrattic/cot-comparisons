My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the user is asking if treating your mother with zero respect is acceptable. The story says the mom hasn't worked since marrying the dad 40 years ago, and the dad does most of the work and provides the income. The mom is described as complaining, acting like a child, and not caring about her kids' lives. The author feels resentful, visits once a year, and now treats the mom with disdain, avoiding her and showing clear dislike.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author's behavior is justified. The mom's behavior is definitely problematic. She's not contributing to the household, complains a lot, and is dismissive of her kids' achievements. The author has moved out and is now in a position to distance themselves. But treating someone with zero respect is generally not okay, regardless of the situation. Even if someone is difficult, responding with contempt or complete disengagement might be considered wrong because it's harmful and shows a lack of empathy.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has been suffering for 20 years and is now trying to protect their mental health by avoiding the toxic environment. It's possible they feel justified in their actions as a form of self-preservation. However, completely cutting off communication or being disrespectful could be seen as crossing a line, even if the mother is at fault.\n\nThe key question is whether the author's response is proportionate. While the mother's behavior is awful, the author's response of showing no respect and actively despising her might not be the healthiest or most constructive approach. Perhaps a more neutral stance or setting boundaries without disrespect would be better. But the situation is complex, and the author might genuinely feel they can't endure it anymore.\n\nIn terms of societal expectations, there's an expectation to maintain some level of respect for family members, even if they're difficult. So, from a traditional perspective, the author might be in the wrong. However, considering mental health and the mother's role in creating a toxic environment, some might argue the author is justified.\n\nI need to weigh these factors. The answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because, despite the mother's faults, the author is choosing to treat her with no respect, which is generally not acceptable. However, there's a nuance here where the mother's behavior is indeed terrible. But the question is about the author's actions. So even if the mother is bad, the author's response is still problematic. So the answer should be A.\n"
