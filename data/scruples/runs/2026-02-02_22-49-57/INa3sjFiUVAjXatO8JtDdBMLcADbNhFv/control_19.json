My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about how they treat their mother, showing a lot of disrespect. The mother hasn't worked since marrying their dad 40 years ago, and the dad is the sole provider. The mom is described as complaining, not having hobbies, and being negative. The author says they avoid their mom during visits and show clear disdain.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms around family respect. In many cultures, especially traditional ones, showing disrespect to parents is frowned upon. The author's behavior\u2014avoiding their mother, leaving the room when she enters, expressing hatred\u2014seems extreme. Even if the mother has flaws, the way the author treats her could be seen as wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother's behavior isn't great either. She's criticized for not supporting her family financially, being negative, and not caring about her children's lives. The author has a valid reason for feeling hurt and frustrated. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nEven if the mother is difficult, the author's response might cross a line. Disrespect and avoidance can damage family relationships further. There might be healthier ways to handle the situation, like setting boundaries without being openly disrespectful. However, the author's justification is based on years of negative experiences. \n\nIn some contexts, it's acceptable to distance oneself from toxic family members, but the author's actions are more than just distancing\u2014they're actively showing contempt. That could be seen as wrong regardless of the mother's behavior. But others might argue that after years of mistreatment, the author is within their rights to protect their mental health. \n\nI need to weigh both sides. The key point is whether the author's actions are unjustified. While the mother isn't perfect, the author's treatment of her is clearly disrespectful. The answer might depend on cultural perspectives and the balance between self-respect and family obligations. However, in most ethical frameworks, treating a family member with disdain is considered wrong, even if the reasons are valid. So, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong), but there are nuances here.\n"
