My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. Let me read through the details again.\n\nThe author is describing their mother as someone who hasn't worked for 40 years since marrying their dad. The dad does most of the cooking, cleaning, and provides all the income. The mom complains about his salary and their lifestyle not being lavish enough. She's described as a petulant child, and the author finds her repulsive, especially during visits for holidays. They mention she has no hobbies except talking about wealth with other women. The author also says she's uninterested in their or their siblings' lives, and even criticized a promotion. They've been living independently now and treat the mom with zero respect, avoiding interactions and leaving the room when she enters. The author is not hiding their disdain anymore.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants my opinion. They ask to answer A or B for yes/no respectively.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother's behavior is clearly toxic. She's not working, relies on her husband's income, and is critical of him. She's distant with her children, showing no interest in their lives and being critical instead. The author's treatment of their mother is very cold\u2014avoiding her, showing disdain, not interacting. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, treating someone with zero respect is generally frowned upon, regardless of the person's behavior. However, the mother's behavior is abusive and emotionally harmful. The author has been subjected to this their whole life, which is traumatic. They're now an adult and have the right to set boundaries, especially since they live far away. \n\nBut does that justify treating her with zero respect? Maybe not. Even if someone is toxic, responding with complete disdain could be seen as harmful in itself. However, the mother's behavior is the root cause here. The author is reacting to years of neglect and criticism. They're not engaging with her, which could be a boundary, but the way they're doing it is extreme. \n\nIn many cases, setting boundaries is healthy. But completely cutting off all contact could be considered harsh, especially if the mother is suffering from her own issues. However, the author mentions that they only visit once a year and are across the country. Their minimal interactions during visits are their way of dealing with the toxicity. \n\nThe key points are: the mother's behavior is objectively problematic, the author has been mistreated, and the author is now an adult. While the author's response is extreme, it's a reaction to long-standing issues. However, treating someone with zero respect isn't healthy, and there might be a more constructive way to handle it. But since the question is about being in the wrong, I have to consider societal norms. In many cultures, respecting parents is emphasized, even if they're difficult. But if the parents are abusive, that expectation can be challenged. \n\nGiven all this, the author's actions are a result of their mother's toxic behavior. But is the author in the wrong? If we look at the actions\u2014avoiding, showing disdain\u2014it's disrespectful. However, the root cause is the mother's behavior. So, there's a balance here. In some contexts, the author isn't in the wrong because they're reacting to abuse, but in others, they are because they're not showing respect regardless of the mother's actions. \n\nI think in this case, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because the mother's behavior is the primary issue, and the author's response, while extreme, is a result of being mistreated. However, there's a nuance here. The author could be advised to set boundaries without disrespect, but legally and morally, the mother's actions are the problem. The author isn't obligated to respect someone who has been harmful to them. So, the answer would be B.\n"
