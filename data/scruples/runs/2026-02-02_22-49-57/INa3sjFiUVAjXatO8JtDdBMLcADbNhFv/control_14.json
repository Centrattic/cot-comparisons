The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is asking if they're at fault for treating their mother with no respect. Their mom hasn't worked since marrying their dad 40 years ago. The dad does most of the cooking, cleaning, and provides the sole income. The mom is always complaining about his salary and her lifestyle not being lavish enough. She's described as acting like a petulant child, and the author finds her repulsive. They live far away, visit once a year, and when they do, they barely talk to their mom, leave the room when she enters, and openly show disdain.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother seems to be in a position where she's not contributing to the household financially or in terms of chores. The father is the sole provider, which might lead to imbalances. The mother's behavior\u2014complaining, criticizing, showing no interest in the children's lives\u2014could be contributing to the author's resentment.\n\nThe author's response is to treat their mother with zero respect, being dismissive and hostile. The question is whether this is justified. On one hand, the mother's behavior is clearly problematic and could be hurtful. On the other hand, the author's hostile actions might be seen as disrespectful, regardless of the mother's behavior.\n\nIn many cultures, respect for parents is considered important, even if the parents are not perfect. However, the mother's behavior is toxic, and the author's treatment of her might be a reaction to that. The key here is whether the author's disrespectful behavior is acceptable given the mother's actions.\n\nI should also consider if there's a middle ground. Maybe the author could express their feelings without being disrespectful, but they choose to completely cut off interaction. That could be seen as extreme, but maybe understandable given the history.\n\nBut the core of the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If we go by the principle that everyone deserves basic respect, even if they're unkind, then the author might be in the wrong. However, if the mother's behavior is so egregious that it justifies the author's response, then maybe not.\n\nAnother angle: the author's actions are harmful to their mother, but if the mother's behavior is also harmful, does that negate the author's wrongdoing? It's a cycle of negativity. But in terms of moral responsibility, it's not an excuse.\n\nIn some perspectives, the author is reacting to long-term mistreatment, so their anger is justified. However, the way they express that anger (disrespect, hostility) might still be considered wrong. The author's behavior could be seen as a form of passive-aggressive or active aggression, which isn't healthy, even if the mother's behavior is the root cause.\n\nSo, the answer might depend on cultural norms and personal ethics. In many cases, even if someone is a difficult person, you're still expected to treat them with some level of respect. The author's actions cross into disrespect, which could make them at fault, regardless of the mother's behavior.\n\nTherefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they're choosing to be disrespectful, even if the mother's behavior is bad. However, some might argue that the mother's actions justify it, making the answer B (No). But given that the question is about the author's actions, not the mother's, the focus is on the author's responsibility to show respect. So, the answer is likely A.\n"
