My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The author is questioning their own behavior towards their mother, treating her with zero respect. The situation is complex.\n\nFirst, the mother hasn't worked since marrying the father 40 years ago. The father handles most household duties and is the sole income. The mother constantly criticizes him for not earning more and complains about her lifestyle. The author finds this behavior repulsive and has a negative experience during visits. The mother also doesn't engage with the children's lives positively, offering criticism instead of support. The author, after living through this for 20 years, now avoids interaction, showing disdain openly.\n\nSo, the author's resentment is understandable. The mother's behavior might be contributing to the author's attitude. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Even if the mother is difficult, treating someone with zero respect and open disdain is generally not acceptable. Family relationships can be tricky, and while the mother's actions are problematic, the author's response is also harmful. The author might be justified in feeling hurt, but their actions (avoiding, showing hatred) are disrespectful. However, the mother's behavior could be seen as a significant factor. But according to social norms, regardless of the mother's actions, the author's treatment of her is still inappropriate. So, the answer might be A (in the wrong), but there's nuance. The mother's behavior is bad, but the author's actions are also wrong. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author is treating their mother poorly, the answer is likely A. However, some might argue the mother's behavior justifies it, but typically you're not supposed to retaliate with disrespect. So the author is in the wrong, answer A.\n"
