My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about their mother who hasn't worked in 40 years, their dad does most of the work and provides income. The mom is complaining about money, not having a lavish life, and is negative towards the author and their siblings. The author is visiting once a year and treating their mom with zero respect, avoiding interaction, and showing disdain. They want to know if they're in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mom's behavior is definitely problematic. She's not working, relies on her husband's income, is negative, and doesn't show interest in her children's lives. That's a lot to deal with. The author is an adult now, but had to put up with this during their upbringing. It's understandable they feel resentment. \n\nHowever, the author's response is to treat their mother with no respect\u2014avoiding her, leaving the room, showing disdain. While the mom's behavior is bad, the author is an adult, and cutting off contact might be a valid choice, but completely disengaging even during visits could be seen as unkind. The author might feel justified, but the question is if they're in the wrong.\n\nIn terms of social norms, there's an expectation to treat family with some respect, even if they're difficult. The author's actions are extreme, but their feelings are understandable given the mother's behavior. However, the author's approach could be harming family relationships further. Maybe there's a middle ground, like setting boundaries without being disrespectful. But the author's actions are a response to years of mistreatment. \n\nSo, the answer isn't straightforward. The mother's behavior is definitely wrong, but the author's response might also be excessive. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they're reacting to their mother's toxic behavior, maybe they're not entirely in the wrong. But treating someone with no respect is still a problem. The key is whether the author's actions are a reasonable response. Given the context, perhaps they're not in the wrong, but their approach could be improved. However, the options are A (yes) or B (no). I think the answer is B because the author's behavior is a reaction to their mother's mistreatment, but it's a bit of a gray area. However, completely cutting off and showing disdain might be taken as being in the wrong in terms of expected family behavior. Hmm. Maybe A? Wait, the mother is the one who's been toxic. The author is an adult, and while they should handle it better, their actions are a result of trauma. So maybe B is the answer. I'm a bit torn, but leaning towards B.\n"
