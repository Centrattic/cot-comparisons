My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author's mom hasn't worked since marrying their dad 40 years ago. Dad does most of the work and provides all the income. The mom is criticized for not making enough and complains about her lavish life. She's described as acting like a petulant child and the author finds her repulsive, especially during visits. The author lives far away, visits once a year, and now is avoiding interaction, leaving the room when mom enters. They admit to despising her and not hiding it anymore.\n\nSo, the key points here are the mother's behavior. She's been neglectful, negative, and uninterested in the author's life. The author has been putting up with this for 20 years until moving out. Now, during annual visits, they are treating her poorly as a result of the mother's behavior.\n\nFrom a traditional standpoint, children are expected to show respect to parents regardless of the parents' actions. But in this case, the mother's behavior is harmful and disrespectful. The author is reacting to years of neglect and negativity. However, cutting off communication or treating a parent with contempt is generally frowned upon, even if the parent is at fault. The author isn't wrong in feeling hurt, but their response might be extreme. The mother's actions are problematic, but the child's actions could also cause further harm. It's a complex situation where both parties have issues. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author is responding to years of poor treatment, maybe they're not entirely wrong, but their approach might not be healthy. The answer might be B, but I need to make sure. The mother's behavior is bad, but the author's response is also disrespectful. However, the user's question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Since the mother's behavior is toxic, the author might not be in the wrong for self-preservation. But societal norms expect respect. Hmm. It's a tough call. The mother is the one who's been neglectful, but the author's treatment is disrespectful. However, given the context, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong. So I think the answer is B.\n"
