My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. The situation is that the mother hasn't worked since marrying the father 40 years ago, the father does most of the work and provides the income, and the mother is constantly critical and materialistic. The author has a bad relationship with their mom, avoiding her during visits and showing disdain.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014lacking a job, complaining about money, not engaging with her children's lives, and being negative. The author feels justified in their resentment because of the mother's toxic behavior. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for their disrespectful treatment.\n\nRespect is generally expected in family relationships, even if the other person isn't respectful. But there's a distinction between setting boundaries and complete disrespect. The author is avoiding interaction, which might be a way to cope, but completely cutting off or showing disdain could be seen as extreme. Some might argue that even a toxic parent deserves basic respect, if for no other reason than to avoid escalating conflict or causing emotional harm.\n\nOn the other hand, the author has a history of being mistreated and only sees a negative environment during visits. They might be prioritizing their mental health by minimizing contact. Cultural norms also play a role here. In some cultures, disrespecting a parent is a serious matter regardless of the parent's behavior.\n\nBut from a general standpoint, even if the mother is at fault, the author's approach of complete disengagement and disdain might be considered crossing a line. They're contributing to a hostile environment and not showing any attempt to communicate or find a middle ground. The mother's actions are wrong, but the way the author is responding could be seen as equally harmful, even if it's a reaction to the mother's behavior.\n\nSo, while the mother's behavior is clearly the root issue, the author's actions could be viewed as inconsiderate and disrespectful, hence A (they are in the wrong). However, others might sympathize with the author's position given the mother's negative influence. But the key is whether the author is in the wrong, not just whether they're justified. The act of treating someone with zero respect is typically seen as wrong, regardless of the reasons. So the answer would be A.\n"
