My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with disrespect. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author's mother hasn't worked since marrying the father 40 years ago. The father handles most household duties and is the sole income provider. The mother is critical of his earnings, complains about her lifestyle, and acts petulantly. She has no hobbies or interests beyond talking about wealth with other women. The author and siblings feel neglected, with the mother only criticizing the author's career. The author now treats the mother poorly during visits, barely speaking and avoiding interaction, even showing disdain.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the context. The mother's behavior is clearly problematic. She's ungrateful, critical, and lacks genuine interest in her children's lives. The father has been the primary caregiver and breadwinner, which is a significant imbalance. The author's resentment is understandable given these dynamics. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for their disrespectful treatment.\n\nIn many cultures, respect for parents is a strong value. Even if a parent behaves poorly, children are often expected to maintain a level of respect. The author's actions\u2014avoiding interaction, showing disdain\u2014could be seen as disrespectful. However, the mother's behavior may have contributed to the author's feelings. The author's isolation and the toxic environment during visits might justify their reaction. But there's a line between justified frustration and disrespectful behavior.\n\nThe key here is to consider the balance between the mother's wrongdoing and the author's response. While the mother's actions are indefensible, the author's treatment could still be seen as inappropriate, especially if it's overtly disrespectful. However, some might argue that the mother's behavior justifies the author's actions as a form of self-preservation. \n\nIn terms of social norms, even in difficult situations, maintaining basic respect is often expected. The author might not be \"in the wrong\" in a moral sense if the mother's actions are the root cause, but from a traditional standpoint, disrespect towards a parent is typically frowned upon. The answer might depend on the cultural context and the severity of the mother's actions versus the author's response. Given the information, the mother's mistreatment is significant, which could make the author's actions more understandable. However, the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" which often relates to social expectations. So, there's a possibility the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the mother's behavior is so bad that the author's response is a reaction to that. But I need to make sure I'm not conflating justification with being in the right. Just because something is understandable doesn't mean it's right. The author is choosing to be disrespectful, which is typically considered wrong regardless of the reason. But again, in some contexts, especially where there's abuse or neglect, people might argue that the child isn't in the wrong. I'm a bit torn here, but leaning towards B because the mother's actions are so egregious, and the author's response, while disrespectful, is a result of long-term mistreatment. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, not just whether it's understandable. So maybe the answer is A, because disrespect is still wrong, even if the mother is at fault. But I need to decide based on the situation provided.\n"
