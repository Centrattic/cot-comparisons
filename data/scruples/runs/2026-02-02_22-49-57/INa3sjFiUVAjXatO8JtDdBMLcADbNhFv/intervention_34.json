My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation is about how they treat their mother. The author describes their mom as someone who hasn't worked for 40 years, relies on their dad for income, is constantly complaining, and lacks real interest in the author's or siblings' lives. The author feels so negatively towards her that they avoid interacting, leave the room when she's there, and openly show disdain during visits.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014berating her husband, having no hobbies, criticizing the kids. But the author's response is to treat her with zero respect, which is the question at hand. \n\nIn many cultures, respect for family is important regardless of their behavior. Even if someone is difficult, showing respect is often expected. The author is choosing to completely distance themselves, which could be seen as disrespectful. However, there's also the aspect of the mother's behavior being toxic and harmful over a long period. The author has only visited once a year and had to endure this for years. \n\nBut the key here is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user already thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to weigh the mother's faults against the author's actions. The author's treatment is extreme\u2014leaving rooms, showing open dislike. Even if the mother is awful, completely cutting her off in terms of interaction during visits might not be the right approach. There might be a middle ground where the author can set boundaries without total disrespect. However, some might argue that the mother's behavior justifies the author's actions. \n\nBut in terms of social norms, respect is usually expected regardless of the other person's behavior. So maybe the author is in the wrong for treating her with zero respect. On the other hand, if the mother is toxic, the author has a right to protect their mental health. It's a bit of a gray area. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author is choosing to show no respect, which is a strong stance, even if the mother is flawed, the answer might lean towards A (yes). But others might see it as justified. However, generally, in these situations, the expectation is that even difficult family members deserve some level of respect. So the author might be in the wrong.\n"
