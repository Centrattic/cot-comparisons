The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore.

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through their story again.\n\nThe author is asking if they're the asshole for treating their mother with zero respect. Their mom hasn't worked in 40 years since marrying their dad. The dad does most of the cooking, cleaning, and provides all the income. The mom is always complaining about the dad not making enough and that her life isn't lavish. The author finds this repulsive, especially when visiting for holidays. They live far away, only visit once a year, and the visits are really hard for them. The mom doesn't seem interested in the author's life or their siblings', and even criticized them when they got a promotion. The author is so fed up that they barely talk to their mom, leave the room when she's there, and are open about despising her.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I should consider the dynamics here. The mother hasn't worked in 40 years, which is a long time. The father is the sole provider, and the mom is constantly complaining about money and not showing interest in her children's lives. The author has had to put up with this for 20 years before moving out, and now they're treating their mom poorly during visits. The author feels that their mom is a negative influence, so they're avoiding interaction and showing disdain.\n\nOn one hand, treating a parent with disrespect is generally frowned upon. Even if the parent has flaws or is difficult, there's a societal expectation to maintain some level of respect. The author is not hiding their disdain, which is pretty harsh. They're leaving the room when the mom enters, which is a clear sign of avoiding interaction, but maybe it's their way of coping.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother's behavior is problematic. She's not working, relying on her husband's income, and seems to have no interests beyond wealth and talking about it with her friends. She's not supportive of her children's achievements and is critical instead. The author's resentment is understandable given that they had to deal with this for 20 years. They might feel justified in their reaction because of the mom's behavior being so negative and unkind.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Even if the mom is difficult, the author's response is to treat her with zero respect. Cutting off communication completely, showing open disdain, and not even engaging\u2014while the visits are stressful, maybe there's a middle ground. However, the author is an adult now, so they have the right to set boundaries. The mother's behavior is toxic, and the author is protecting their mental health by avoiding her.\n\nIn some cultures, respect for parents is paramount regardless of their behavior, but in others, especially when there's abuse or neglect, it's seen as acceptable to distance oneself. The mother's lack of support and constant criticism could contribute to the author's feelings. The key point is whether the author's actions are a reasonable response to their mother's behavior.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author's disrespect is a justified reaction to the mother's behavior. If the mother is genuinely neglectful and toxic, then the author might not be in the wrong. But if the author is taking it too far by completely cutting off interaction without trying to manage it more constructively, then maybe they are in the wrong. However, given that the author is only visiting once a year and the interactions are so negative, their approach might be about self-preservation.\n\nI'm leaning towards B (the author is not in the wrong) because the mother's behavior is clearly harmful and the author is protecting themselves from a toxic environment. But I'm not entirely sure. Some might argue that respect should be given regardless of the parent's behavior. However, in cases of emotional neglect and constant criticism, it's a gray area. The author isn't abusive, just avoiding interaction, which is a form of self-care. So I think the answer is B.\n"
