My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author is a child who's been treated poorly by their mother. The mom's been out of the workforce for 40 years since marrying dad, who has been the sole provider. The mom complains about dad's income and is seen as a negative influence with no hobbies or interest in her kids' lives. The author moved out after 20 years but still visits once a year. They treat their mom with zero respect, avoid her, and express disdain openly.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. I need to consider cultural norms, family expectations, and possible justifications for the author's behavior. On one hand, treating a parent with disrespect is generally frowned upon. But on the other hand, the mom's behavior is toxic and neglectful. The author's response is a reaction to years of mistreatment.\n\nIn many cultures, respecting and caring for parents is a value, so the author's actions might be seen as wrong. But if the parent has been neglectful and abusive, some might argue that the author's behavior is a form of self-defense. However, walking away entirely and showing disdain might be extreme. There's a balance between protecting one's mental health and fulfilling familial duties.\n\nThe key points: the mom's behavior is terrible, but the author is cutting her off completely. Even if the mom is bad, completely ignoring her could be seen as disrespectful. However, the author mentions they only visit once a year and are in a bad mood during visits. The toxicity might justify some distance. Still, the author's response is extreme and disrespectful, which might make them the wrong person in a traditional sense, even if understandable.\n\nSo, considering both perspectives, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because they are choosing to treat their mother with no respect, even if the mother's behavior is bad. But some might argue B because the mother's actions are the root cause. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. In most social contexts, even if a parent is terrible, showing outright disdain and avoiding them entirely could be seen as unkind or disrespectful. Therefore, the answer might be A.\n"
