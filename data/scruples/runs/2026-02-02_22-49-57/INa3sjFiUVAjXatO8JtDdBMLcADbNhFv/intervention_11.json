My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author treating their mother with zero respect during visits. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, so I need to consider both sides.\n\nFirst, the mother's actions: She hasn't worked in 40 years, the father handles most of the household responsibilities. She's criticized her husband's income and acts like a \"petulant child.\" She's dismissive of the author's achievements and focuses on wealth discussions. The author feels neglected and negative, leading to their disrespectful behavior.\n\nThe author's response: They barely talk to their mom, avoid her during visits, and openly dislike her. They feel justified because of the mother's behavior over the years. The key question is whether the author's disrespectful treatment is acceptable given the mother's actions.\n\nOn one hand, family relationships require respect, even if the other person is difficult. The author might be justified in feeling upset, but cutting off communication and showing disdain could be seen as disrespectful regardless of the mother's behavior. However, if the mother is toxic and the author's mental health is affected, there's an argument for self-preservation.\n\nBut the author admits they're not hiding their disdain, which might affect family dynamics. The mother might not be perfect, but the author's response might be harmful too. However, the mother's actions contributed to the author's feelings. Maybe the author isn't in the wrong because they're reacting to a toxic environment. But treating someone with zero respect is generally wrong, even if the person is flawed. So the answer could be A, but I need to weigh the context. The mother's behavior is awful, but the author's response is also extreme. It's a tough call. The author might be in the wrong for showing no respect, but their justification is strong. Hmm.\n"
