The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe author's mom hasn't had a job for 40 years since marrying their dad. The dad is the sole provider, doing most of the cooking and cleaning. The mom complains about his income and isn't lavish enough. She's described as a petulant child, and the author finds her repulsive during visits. The mom also has no hobbies and only talks about wealth with her friends. She's not interested in the author's or siblings' lives, even criticizing a promotion. The author is so fed up that they avoid interaction, leave the room when she enters, and openly show disdain.\n\nHmm. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I should consider the ethical and social norms around family respect. Generally, respect is expected, regardless of the family member's behavior. But there's also the context of the mom's actions. The mom is portrayed as neglectful, self-centered, and unkind. The author has been dealing with this for years and is only visiting once a year now. The author's reaction is to minimize interaction and show disdain. \n\nOn one hand, the author's behavior is disrespectful. Disrespecting a parent is typically frowned upon in many cultures. But on the other hand, the mom's behavior is toxic and harmful. The author has valid reasons for feeling this way. However, the author's response could be seen as cutting off the relationship entirely, which might be excessive. \n\nI need to think about whether the author is justified. While the mom's behavior is problematic, the author's treatment of her is equally problematic. Even if the mom is difficult, the author could try to manage their interactions more respectfully, perhaps by setting boundaries without being openly disrespectful. \n\nBut maybe in this case, the mom's behavior has caused prolonged emotional harm to the author, leading to a justified reaction. However, the author's solution is to treat the mom with zero respect, which might not be the healthiest approach but could be understandable given the circumstances. \n\nI'm a bit torn. The author's actions are disrespectful, but the context might mitigate some of the blame. Still, from a traditional standpoint, disrespecting a parent is considered wrong regardless of the parent's actions. However, some might argue that in abusive or toxic situations, self-preservation is valid. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author's response is proportionate. The mom's behavior is bad, but the author's response is also bad. It's a cycle of negativity. The author could be seeking advice on how to handle the situation better, but the question is whether they are in the wrong. \n\nGiven that the author is consciously choosing to be disrespectful and show open disdain, that's typically seen as wrong, even if the parent is at fault. So the answer might be A, but I'm not entirely sure. Maybe the answer is B because the mom's behavior is so bad that the author's reaction is understandable. But I think the question is more about the author's actions rather than the justification. So maybe A is the answer because showing zero respect is wrong regardless of the mother's behavior.\n"
