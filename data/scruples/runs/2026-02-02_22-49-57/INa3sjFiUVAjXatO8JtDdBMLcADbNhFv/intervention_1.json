My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) scenario is in the wrong. The author is treating their mother with zero respect, leaving the room when she enters, and not engaging much during visits. The reasoning given is that the mother has been uninvolved, complained about her husband's income, and shown little interest in the author's life. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The mother hasn't worked since marrying the father 40 years ago. The father does most of the work and provides the sole income. The mother is described as complaining about money, having no hobbies, and being a negative influence. The author feels neglected and has been treated poorly over the years. Now, they're cutting her off during visits as a result.\n\nThe question is about respect and whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, showing respect is important, even if someone is difficult. On the other hand, the author has been enduring a toxic environment for a long time, and their actions might be a form of self-protection. \n\nBut treating someone with zero respect is generally not acceptable. Even if the mother has flaws, responding with disdain and avoiding interaction entirely might be seen as disrespectful. The author might be justified in their feelings, but their actions are dismissive rather than attempting to communicate or set boundaries in a healthier way. \n\nHowever, considering the mother's behavior over decades, the author's response could be a culmination of long-term neglect and mistreatment. It's possible that the author is reacting to years of negative experiences, and their actions might be a form of self-care rather than malice. But the key point is whether they're in the wrong. \n\nIn many cultures, respecting elders, including parents, is a strong value. So, even if the mother is difficult, the author might still be expected to show basic respect. However, if the mother is truly toxic and the author is protecting their mental health, some might argue that the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nBut the line between self-protection and disrespect is thin. The author's method of cutting off contact during visits might be seen as wrong because it doesn't acknowledge the mother's role and could cause emotional harm. Respect doesn't mean you have to agree or be cordial, but completely avoiding interaction and showing disdain might cross into disrespect. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because they're treating their mother with zero respect, regardless of the circumstances. Even in a toxic environment, some level of respect is expected. However, there's also the argument that the author is acting in self-defense after years of neglect. But generally, the answer would lean towards A because the behavior described is disrespectful.\n"
