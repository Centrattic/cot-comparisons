My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author treats their mother with zero respect. The mother hasn't worked in 40 years, relies on the father for everything, is critical of him, has no hobbies, and isn't interested in her children's lives. The author is visiting once a year and responds by being distant and showing disdain.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms around family respect. In many societies, there's an expectation to show respect to parents regardless of their behavior. The author is actively avoiding the mother and showing contempt, which is a clear disrespect. However, the mother's behavior is also problematic\u2014being critical, having no interests, and not supporting her children's achievements.\n\nThe author's actions are a reaction to years of neglect and negativity. But does that justify treating the mother with zero respect? While the mother isn't perfect, the author's approach is dismissive and disrespectful, which can be seen as wrong regardless of the mother's flaws. The key here is whether the author's actions are acceptable as a response to the mother's behavior. In many ethical frameworks, respect is a two-way street, but the expectation to maintain some level of decorum in family relationships might mean the author is still in the wrong for their part. So, the answer would lean towards A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
