My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with no respect. The situation describes a mother who hasn't worked since marrying the father 40 years ago. The dad is the sole provider, and the mom is described as complaining about money, being a burden, and not showing interest in the kids' lives.\n\nThe author says they can't stand being around their mom and now completely avoid interacting with her during visits, even leaving the room when she enters. They don't hide their dislike. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. The mother's behavior is clearly problematic. She's not working, complaining about the family's financial situation despite the father's good salary, and not engaging with her children's lives. That's a lot of stress on the family, especially on the kids. The author's resentment is understandable given the years of neglect and negativity.\n\nHowever, treating someone with zero respect, especially a parent, is typically frowned upon in many cultures. The author is cutting off communication, which is a form of emotional neglect. Even if the mother is difficult, children are often expected to show some level of respect and courtesy. The author might feel justified, but society generally values family ties and respectful interactions even in difficult situations.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother's behavior is toxic. The author has been through years of emotional abuse and is now in their own home, so they might have the right to set boundaries. But completely ignoring and despising a parent could be seen as wrong, depending on cultural values.\n\nI need to weigh the mother's faults against the author's actions. The mother's behavior is definitely contributing to the conflict, but the author's response is extreme. There might be a middle ground where the author could address the situation without total disrespect. However, given the mother's lack of interest and the author's mental health, maybe it's a form of self-preservation. \n\nIn many cases, people are held responsible for mistreatment even if the other party is at fault. But in this case, the author's actions are a reaction to long-term neglect. It's a tricky balance. The answer might depend on whether the author's actions are seen as justified self-defense against an abusive parent. However, most would argue that respect is a two-way street, but if the parent is abusive, the child isn't entirely to blame. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because the mother's behavior is toxic and the author is protecting their own well-being. But some might argue that respect is still important regardless of the parent's actions. However, the mother's lack of respect and support could mitigate the author's responsibility.\n"
