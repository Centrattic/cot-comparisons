My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with no respect. The situation is that the mother hasn't worked for 40 years since marrying the dad, who does all the work and provides income. The mom is complained about the dad's salary, is a \"petulant child,\" has no hobbies, and is negative. The author has to visit once a year, and because of this, they treat their mom badly, avoiding her, not talking, and showing disdain.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural context. In many cultures, respect for parents is a big deal. But the mother's behavior is toxic. The author is justified in feeling upset, but the way they respond could be problematic. The author is in their 20s, maybe, and after being in that situation for 20 years. They're at their breaking point. However, completely cutting off communication and showing disdain, even if the mother is difficult, might not be the healthiest approach. \n\nOn the other hand, the mother's behavior is clearly harmful. She's negative, lacks empathy, and doesn't support her children's achievements. The author's actions could be a form of self-preservation. But is it the right approach? Maybe there's a middle ground where setting boundaries without complete disrespect could work. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If we take the mother's actions into account, the author's response is understandable, but intentionally showing disdain and avoiding her entirely might still be considered disrespectful. However, in some perspectives, the mother's behavior is so bad that the author isn't entirely wrong. \n\nI think there's a balance here. The author is reacting to a toxic environment, but the way they react could be seen as wrong because they're choosing to be disrespectful rather than trying to set boundaries respectfully. But given the mother's behavior, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong. So maybe the answer is B (No), because the mother's behavior is so bad that the author's reaction, while not ideal, is understandable. But I need to make sure. The key point is whether treating someone with zero respect is ever justified. Even if the person is awful, the author is still their child, and societal norms often expect some level of respect. However, if the mother is toxic, the author's actions might be a form of self-protection. \n\nAlternatively, the author could be in the wrong because they're choosing disrespect over a more constructive approach. But given the context, maybe the answer is B.\n"
