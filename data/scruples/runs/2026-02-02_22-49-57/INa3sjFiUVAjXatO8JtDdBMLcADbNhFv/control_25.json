My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nSo, the author's mom hasn't worked since marrying their dad 40 years ago. The dad is the sole provider, doing most of the cooking and cleaning. The mom is constantly criticizing the dad's income and lifestyle, acting petulantly. The author finds her repulsive, especially during visits. They've been putting up with her for 20 years, and now they're cutting her off, leaving the room, showing disdain. The author feels justified because the mom has no hobbies, no interest in their lives, and is negative.\n\nHmm, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. On one hand, the author's behavior is disrespectful\u2014ignoring their mother, avoiding interaction, showing hostility. That's not kind or respectful, and in many cultures, respecting parents is a big deal. But on the other hand, the mom's behavior is clearly problematic. She's been a stay-at-home mom but hasn't contributed, is critical, and emotionally distant. The author has a history of being unappreciated and neglected, which could justify their feelings of resentment.\n\nBut does that justify treating someone with zero respect? Even if the mother is difficult, the author's response is extreme. Maybe there's a better way to handle it, like setting boundaries while still showing basic respect. The author's actions could hurt the mother and damage the relationship further. Also, the author is an adult now, so perhaps they need to take responsibility for their behavior. It's possible they're reacting to years of emotional abuse, but that doesn't make their actions right. The key here is whether the author's actions are justified given their past. However, intentionally showing contempt and avoiding interaction entirely is generally considered disrespectful, regardless of the reasons. So the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong), but I need to be sure. Let me think again: the mother's behavior is bad, but the author's response is toxic. They should address the issues without dehumanizing their mom. So yes, the author is in the wrong because they're treating their mother poorly, even if the mother's behavior is unacceptable. The right approach would be to maintain some level of respect while setting boundaries, not the complete cold shoulder. So I think the answer is A.\n"
