My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. The situation involves the mother being a stay-at-home wife, criticized for not earning money, and having a negative attitude towards her family.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and familial norms. In many cultures, respect for parents is expected, regardless of their behavior. The author is avoiding their mother, showing contempt, and not engaging. That could be seen as disrespectful. However, the mother's behavior is described as negative and dismissive towards her children, which might explain the author's feelings.\n\nThe mother hasn't contributed financially, is critical, and lacks interest in her children's lives. The author's resentment could stem from years of this treatment. But from a traditional perspective, even if the parent is flawed, the child is still expected to show respect. \n\nThere's a balance between self-respect and filial duty. The author's actions might be a result of emotional harm from the mother. However, treating someone with zero respect, even if hurtful, can be seen as wrong because it perpetuates a cycle of negativity and might harm family relationships further. \n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author isn't in the wrong, but the question is whether they are. It's a gray area. The mother's behavior is problematic, but the author's response is also extreme. It depends on societal expectations and the context of the family dynamics. \n\nI think in many perspectives, the author might be justified in their feelings but not in their actions. So the answer might be A (in the wrong) because respect is expected regardless of the parent's behavior. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) if considering the mother's behavior as contributing to the author's response. But I'm leaning towards A because the author is choosing to be disrespectful, which is generally frowned upon.\n"
