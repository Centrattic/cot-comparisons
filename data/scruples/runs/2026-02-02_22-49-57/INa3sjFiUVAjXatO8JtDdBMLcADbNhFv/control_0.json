My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is at fault for treating their mother with zero respect. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe author's mom has been staying at home since marrying their dad 40 years ago. The dad is the sole provider, doing most of the cooking and cleaning. The mom complains about his income and isn't happy with their lifestyle. She's described as acting like a petulant child, and the author finds her repulsive. The author lives across the country and only visits once a year for holidays, which are stressful. They mention that their mom doesn't care about their or their siblings' lives, and even criticized a promotion. The author's response is to treat their mom with no respect, avoiding interaction and showing disdain. They feel justified because of the mom's behavior over the years.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The mom's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014she's not contributing to the household, is constantly negative, and doesn't support her children emotionally. The dad is the sole provider and also handling most chores, which adds to the stress. The author's resentment is understandable given the mom's treatment over 20 years before moving out. However, the author's response is to completely cut off communication and show open disdain during visits. While the mom's behavior is terrible, the author's approach might be seen as harsh. \n\nBut maybe the question is about whether the author is at fault. The key here is understanding that while the mother's actions are wrong, the child's response, though disrespectful, might be a reaction to long-term mistreatment. However, society generally expects some level of respect towards parents regardless of their behavior. The author's actions could be seen as crossing a line, even if their feelings are justified. On the other hand, if the mother's behavior is as toxic as described, some might argue the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries.\n\nI need to weigh the cultural expectations here. In many cultures, showing respect to parents is a fundamental expectation. Even if the parent is at fault, the child's disrespect might still be considered wrong. But others might empathize with the author's frustration and see their actions as a necessary defense mechanism against emotional abuse. The answer could hinge on whether the author's behavior is a proportionate response to the mother's treatment. Since the author has been subjected to years of negativity and lack of support, their actions might be seen as understandable, though not necessarily acceptable. However, the question is whether they're \"in the wrong.\" If the answer depends on cultural norms, then the author might still be considered in the wrong because respect is expected regardless of the parent's behavior. Alternatively, if the mother's behavior is so toxic that the author's response is a form of self-preservation, then maybe they aren't in the wrong. It's a tricky balance. I think the general consensus here would be that while the author has reasons for their feelings, treating a parent with zero respect is not acceptable, hence they are in the wrong. So the answer would be A.\n"
