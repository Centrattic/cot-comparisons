My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether treating their mother with zero respect is justified based on the situation described. \n\nFirst, the user provided a detailed account of their mother's behavior. The mom hasn't worked for 40 years, relies on the dad's income, constantly complains about his salary, and acts like a child. She's described as having no hobbies or interests beyond talking about wealth with friends. The author also mentions that the mother isn't interested in their or their siblings' lives and gives negative comments, like criticizing a promotion for being too slow. The author has only been visiting once a year and now responds with minimal interaction, avoiding her and showing open disdain.\n\nSo, the key points here are the mother's behavior towards the family, especially the father, and her lack of support or interest in the children's lives. The author's response is to treat her with no respect, which raises the question of whether that's justified.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, respect is generally considered a baseline in family relationships. Even if someone's actions are hurtful, the expectation is that family members should at least attempt to maintain some level of respect. The author's actions\u2014leaving the room, barely speaking, and showing disdain\u2014seem extreme. However, the mother's behavior is also problematic; she's portrayed as neglectful, critical, and self-centered.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, while the mother's actions are clearly harmful, the child's responsibility towards their parent can vary based on cultural and personal beliefs. In many societies, respect for parents is a value, but that doesn't mean they should tolerate abuse. The author is an adult, and setting boundaries is important. However, completely cutting off communication and showing no respect might be seen as disproportionate, especially if the author hasn't tried to address the issues or set boundaries first.\n\nOn the other hand, if the mother's behavior is genuinely toxic and the author has tried everything and still can't handle it, then their reaction might be understandable. The challenge is balancing self-respect and the expectation of familial respect. The author might argue that they've given up on the relationship because of the mother's consistent negativity. But from an external perspective, the lack of effort to communicate or find a middle ground could make their stance seem harsh. \n\nIn summary, while the mother's behavior is definitely problematic, the author's complete lack of respect without any apparent attempt to address the issues might be seen as crossing a line. So, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong). But I'm not entirely sure because the mother's actions are pretty awful. Maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the mother's behavior justifies the author's response. It's a tough call. I think in this case, the author's actions are a reaction to long-term neglect and abuse, so maybe they're not in the wrong. But I'm conflicted. The key is whether the author's response is proportionate. If the mother is truly toxic and the author can't reconcile, maybe the answer is B.\n"
