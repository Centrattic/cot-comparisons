My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the user is asking about their treatment of their mother. The author has been treating their mom with zero respect, avoiding interaction, and showing disdain. The mom, according to the author, has been a source of negativity for years, not working, depending on the dad, and being critical.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics described. The mom hasn't worked in 40 years, the dad is the sole provider, and the mom is described as complaining and having no interests beyond discussing wealth. The author feels neglected, as the mom shows no interest in their or their siblings' lives. The author is now visiting once a year and finds these visits draining, leading them to treat their mom poorly.\n\nOn one hand, the author's actions\u2014like leaving the room when the mom enters and not hiding their disdain\u2014clearly show disrespect. Even if the mom has flaws, treating a parent with such contempt is generally considered disrespectful and harmful. Family relationships often require effort to maintain, and even if there are issues, cutting someone out completely might not be the healthiest approach, though it's understandable given the circumstances.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's grievances are significant. The mom's behavior is portrayed as toxic and neglectful. The author has had to endure this for 20 years before leaving home, and each visit is a negative experience. The emotional toll might explain their actions, but that doesn't necessarily justify them. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for their response.\n\nBut wait, respect in relationships is a two-way street. If the mom has shown little to no support or interest in her children's lives, the author's resentment is understandable. However, the way the author is handling it\u2014complete disregard and avoidance\u2014might be counterproductive. It could also cause emotional pain to the mother, even if she's at fault.\n\nI should also consider cultural or societal norms. In many cultures, there's an expectation to respect one's parents regardless of their behavior. So, even if the mom is flawed, the author might be expected to show respect. But if the mom is truly as toxic as described, it's a complex situation where self-preservation is a factor.\n\nSo, balancing both sides: the author's actions are disrespectful, but the context of the mother's behavior provides some justification. However, the wrongness of the author's actions might still be in question because they are choosing to treat their parent this way, which could be seen as a failure in maintaining a respectful relationship, even in adversity. But given the extreme nature of the mother's behavior, maybe the author isn't entirely in the wrong. It's a tough call, but the answer likely depends on the perspective taken\u2014whether the focus is on the author's actions or the mother's behavior leading to them.\n"
