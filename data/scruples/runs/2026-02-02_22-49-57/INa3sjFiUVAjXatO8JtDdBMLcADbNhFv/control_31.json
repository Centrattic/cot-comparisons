My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect.\n\nFirst, let's break down the details. The mother hasn't worked in 40 years since marrying the dad. The dad is the sole provider, doing most of the cooking and cleaning. The mother is always complaining about money, not making enough, and is described as acting like a petulant child. She has no hobbies and only talks about wealth with friends. She's not interested in her kids' lives, and even criticized a promotion the author received. The author is now visiting once a year, but during these visits, they're disrespectful, barely talking, leaving the room when she enters, and openly showing hatred. The author wants to know if they're in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are the mother's behavior versus the author's response. The mother's actions seem pretty negative\u2014neglecting her children, being critical, not contributing to the household, and having a poor attitude. The author, after 20 years of this, is now treating her disrespectfully. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nOn one hand, the author has valid reasons to be upset. The mother's behavior is toxic and disrespectful. The author may feel justified in their response because of the years of neglect and negativity. On the other hand, treating a parent with zero respect, even if they've been awful, can be seen as wrong. Family dynamics are complex, and respect is often expected regardless of the parent's behavior.\n\nBut in this case, the mother's actions are contributing to the author's decision. The author isn't being disrespectful out of nowhere; it's a reaction to years of mistreatment. However, society often holds that even if a parent is bad, children should still respect them. But some might argue that the mother's behavior is so harmful that the author's response is understandable.\n\nI need to weigh these factors. The author's actions are extreme, but the mother's behavior is also problematic. The mother is not showing the typical parental support and is instead being a negative influence. The author's treatment during visits is minimal at best, but they're not the one causing the issues. The mother is the one who's been the source of stress and negativity.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, maybe the author is not entirely in the wrong. They're reacting to a difficult situation. However, completely cutting off communication and showing disdain might not be the healthiest approach, but does that make them wrong? The question is about being in the wrong, not about the best course of action. The mother's actions are the root cause, but the author's response is also extreme. It's a tricky balance. Some might say the author is in the wrong because respect is expected, others might say they're justified given the mother's behavior. But in the context of the question, which is a typical AITA scenario, often these stories result in the author being seen as not in the wrong if their reasons are clear and the other party's faults are significant. The mother's behavior is quite bad here. So, likely the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
