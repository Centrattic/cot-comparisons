My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person is asking if they're the asshole for treating their mom with zero respect. Their mom hasn't worked since marrying their dad 40 years ago, and the dad is the sole provider, doing most of the cooking and cleaning. The mom is constantly complaining about the dad's salary and wants a more lavish lifestyle. She's described as acting like a petulant child, and the author feels repulsed by her. They live far away and only visit once a year, but when they do, the mom's behavior makes the author's mood terrible. The author has been treating the mom poorly for 20 years, avoiding her, saying little, and not hiding their disdain.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural context. In many cultures, children are expected to show respect to their parents regardless of the parents' behavior. So if the mom is being difficult and the author is reacting negatively, there might be a conflict in expectations. But then, the mom's behavior is also problematic. She's not working, which might be a choice or perhaps due to other circumstances. The dad is the one working hard and doing most of the housework, while the mom is critical and has no hobbies or interests beyond talking about wealth. That sounds like she's not contributing and is focused on material things, which could be frustrating for the family.\n\nThe author's treatment of their mother is very harsh\u2014basically ignoring her and hiding their dislike. But they've had to endure this for 20 years, and the visits are only once a year. The mom's actions, like criticizing a promotion, add to the author's resentment. The question is whether the author's disrespectful behavior is justified given their mom's actions.\n\nOn one hand, disrespect towards a parent is generally frowned upon. Even if the parent is difficult, the child is still expected to be polite. On the other hand, if the parent is creating a toxic environment with constant criticism and a lack of support, the child's reaction might be a form of self-preservation. The key here is whether the author's actions are proportionate to the mom's behavior. The mom is described as a negative force, so the author might feel justified in setting boundaries. However, completely cutting off communication and showing disdain could be seen as going too far, especially if the mom is still a parent and part of the family. It's a complicated situation where both parties might have some issues, but the author's actions are definitely contributing to the conflict. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong, because they're not respecting a parent, even if the mom is difficult.\n"
