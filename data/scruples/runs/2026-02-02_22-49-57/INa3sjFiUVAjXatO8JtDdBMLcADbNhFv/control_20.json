My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The author describes their mother as someone who has never worked, relies solely on their father's income, complains about money, and is generally negative and uninterested in her children's lives. The author, after living with her for 20 years, treats her with zero respect during visits, avoids interaction, and openly shows disdain.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mother's behavior sounds toxic and emotionally neglectful. She's not contributing to the household, complains constantly, and is dismissive of the children's achievements. The father is doing most of the work, which adds to the imbalance. The author has moved out and only visits once a year, which is a long time to be away. When they do visit, the environment is unpleasant, and the author is reacting by avoiding the mother. \n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Respect in family relationships is generally expected, even if the other person's behavior is poor. The author's actions\u2014cutting interactions to a minimum, leaving the room when the mother enters, showing open disdain\u2014could be seen as disrespectful. While the mother's behavior is problematic, the author's response might be considered an overreaction. Family dynamics are complex, and while the mother's behavior is hurtful, the author's complete lack of engagement during visits could be seen as a withdrawal of respect, which is important for maintaining family bonds. \n\nHowever, there's also a consideration of self-preservation. The author is in a toxic environment and is trying to protect their own mental health. The mother's actions have created a hostile environment, and the author's response might be a way to cope. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about mental health. The key point is whether the author's actions are justified. \n\nIn many cases, even in the face of poor treatment, maintaining some level of respect is advised to prevent further deterioration of relationships. The author's approach of complete disengagement without any effort to maintain a respectful interaction could be seen as crossing a line. While the mother's behavior is deplorable, the author's actions might still be considered disrespectful, hence the answer could be A. However, some might argue that the mother's behavior is so bad that the author is justified. But according to the question's context, the answer is likely A because the author's actions are disrespectful regardless of the mother's behavior.\n"
