My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about how they treat their mother. The author describes their mother as someone who has been unemployed for 40 years, relying on the father's income, is constantly negative, and doesn't show interest in their or their siblings' lives. The author has been cutting them off for 20 years before moving out and now treats their mother with zero respect, avoiding interaction and showing disdain.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother's behavior sounds toxic\u2014complaining, lack of interest in her children's lives, and focusing on wealth. The author feels hurt and frustrated, leading to their disrespectful treatment. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for responding this way.\n\nOn one hand, the mother's actions might justify the author's feelings. However, treating someone with zero respect is generally not acceptable, regardless of the reasons. The author is taking a stance of complete disengagement, which could be seen as a lack of empathy or a failure to maintain a relationship, even a strained one. But is the author's response a justifiable reaction to years of neglect and negativity?\n\nThe key here is whether the author's actions are proportionate. While the mother's behavior is harmful, responding with such overt disdain and avoidance might not be the healthiest approach, but it's also a form of self-protection. However, the question is not about health but about being \"in the wrong.\" If we're judging based on social norms, showing no respect and avoiding interaction entirely might be seen as wrong, even if the mother is at fault. But if we consider the context, the author's actions could be a justified self-defense.\n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because their response is a reaction to long-term mistreatment. However, some might argue that it's their duty to treat their mother with respect regardless. But given the details, the author's feelings are valid, and their actions are a coping mechanism. So the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
