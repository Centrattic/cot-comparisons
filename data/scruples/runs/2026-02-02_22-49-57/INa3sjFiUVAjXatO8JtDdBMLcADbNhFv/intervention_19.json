My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. The author describes a mom who hasn't worked since marrying their dad, complains about money, is critical, and not interested in their lives. The author responds by being cold and avoiding interaction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural context. In many cultures, respecting parents is important, but that doesn't necessarily mean you have to like them. The mother's behavior sounds pretty toxic\u2014constant complaints, lack of support, and being dismissive of the author's achievements. The author is an adult, living across the country, and only visits once a year. They feel the visits are miserable because of their mom's behavior.\n\nThe author's actions are extreme\u2014barely speaking and avoiding interactions. While the mom's behavior is awful, cutting off communication entirely might be seen as disrespectful. However, the author is an adult and has the right to set boundaries. The key is whether the disrespect is justified given the mom's actions. The story paints the mom as the antagonist, and the author as a victim. But treating someone with zero respect is harsh, even if they're a difficult person. Maybe there's a middle ground where the author could show respect without engaging in the negative behavior. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the mother is genuinely toxic and the author is protecting their mental health, maybe it's understandable. However, completely cutting off a parent is traditionally seen as disrespectful. So there's a conflict between personal well-being and familial respect. The answer might depend on the severity of the mother's actions versus the author's response. Here, the mother's behavior is extreme, which could justify the author's actions. But I'm not sure if that's a valid excuse. Maybe the author could work on managing interactions without being disrespectful. But given the situation, the author's resentment is clear, and they're an adult. So maybe B is the right answer.\n"
