My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. The situation described is that the mother hasn't worked in 40 years, relies on the father for income, is critical of him, and is generally negative and uninterested in the author's life. The author responds by being disrespectful, avoiding interaction, and showing disdain during visits.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if the author's actions are justified. The mother's behavior sounds toxic and neglectful. She's complained about the father's income, lacks hobbies, and is dismissive of her children's achievements. The author has had to endure this for years, leading to resentment and emotional harm. In such cases, people often feel justified in setting boundaries to protect their mental health.\n\nHowever, respect is generally expected in family relationships, regardless of the other person's behavior. Disrespecting a parent can lead to guilt or conflict, but it's also important to acknowledge the parent's role in the dynamic. The mother's actions contribute to the problem, but the author's response of complete disengagement and disdain might be seen as extreme. While understandable, treating someone with zero respect can perpetuate negativity and might not encourage change.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's mental health and well-being are valid concerns. If maintaining a respectful facade causes more harm, setting boundaries could be necessary. The key here is whether the author's actions are proportionate to the mother's behavior. The mother's neglect and negativity have been ongoing, so the author's reaction, while harsh, might be a coping mechanism.\n\nIn some cultures or family systems, respect is non-negotiable, which could frame the author as wrong. However, in others, prioritizing self-care and emotional health is encouraged. The answer might depend on cultural norms, but the question is likely seeking a more general moral judgment.\n\nConsidering all aspects, the mother's behavior is clearly problematic. The author's response, while extreme, stems from a place of hurt and a need to protect themselves. While it's not ideal to treat a parent with zero respect, the mother's actions contribute significantly to the situation. Therefore, the author might not be entirely in the wrong, as they are reacting to long-term mistreatment.\n"
