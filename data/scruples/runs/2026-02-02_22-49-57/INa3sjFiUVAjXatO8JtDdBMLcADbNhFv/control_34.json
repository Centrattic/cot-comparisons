My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is about whether treating their mother with zero respect is justified based on their situation.\n\nFirst, the user describes their mother as someone who hasn't worked since marrying their father 40 years ago. The dad handles most of the household chores and provides the income. The mother is portrayed as complaining about his earnings and not being lavish enough. She's also described as having no hobbies or interests beyond talking about wealth with other women. The user mentions that their mom is uninterested in their lives and gives negative feedback, like criticizing their promotion for taking too long. The user moved out after 20 years and now visits once a year but treats their mom with disdain, avoiding interaction and showing clear dislike. The key issue here is whether the user's disrespectful behavior is justified.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the user feels wronged by their mother's behavior\u2014being neglectful, critical, and uninterested. They might feel that their mother hasn't supported them or shown love. On the other hand, treating someone with zero respect is generally considered disrespectful, regardless of the reasons. Even if the mother has flaws, the way the user is handling it could be harmful. There's a difference between not engaging and outright showing disdain. The user might be projecting their frustration, but cutting off communication entirely, even if it's just during visits, could be seen as a valid choice given their feelings. However, some might argue that maintaining a respectful relationship is important for family, even if it's strained. The user's actions might be a coping mechanism, but others might say that they should try to communicate or set boundaries rather than completely shut down. Also, the mother might have her own issues that aren't discussed here. It's possible that the user's response is an overreaction, but given the description, it's also possible they're reacting to a very toxic dynamic. So, is the user in the wrong? It's tricky. They have reasons, but the way they're handling it is extreme. Maybe the answer is A (wrong) because regardless of the mother's behavior, treating someone with zero respect isn't acceptable. Or B (not wrong) because the mother's behavior is so toxic. I need to weigh these factors. The key points are the user's justification for their actions versus societal expectations of family respect. In many cultures, showing respect to parents is expected, even if they're flawed. However, in cases of abuse or neglect, some leeway is given. Here, the mother isn't abusive, just neglectful and critical. The user's extreme reaction might not be justified. Therefore, the answer might be A. But I need to be careful. Alternatively, maybe it's B because the mother is the one causing the problems. Hmm. I think the answer depends on cultural context and personal values, but generally, the user is in the wrong because they're choosing to be disrespectful, even if the mother is at fault. So, Answer A.\n"
