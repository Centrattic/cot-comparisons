My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person is asking if they're the asshole for treating their mother with zero respect. Their mom hasn't worked in 40 years since marrying their dad, who handles all the cooking, cleaning, and finances. The mom constantly complains about his income and acts petulantly. The author is really fed up, especially during visits, and now they barely talk to her, avoid her, and show disdain openly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral aspects here. The author feels their mom is ungrateful and toxic. The mom's behavior is described as negative and dismissive towards the author's achievements. However, how the author is responding\u2014avoiding her, showing contempt\u2014could be seen as disrespectful regardless of the mom's behavior. But then again, maybe they have a right to set boundaries after years of mistreatment.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a traditional standpoint, respecting one's parents is often emphasized, but this is more about the mother's behavior. The author isn't just being disrespectful out of spite; they've had years of negative interactions. However, the way they're treating their mom now might be excessive. Even if the mom is difficult, the author's actions could be considered disrespectful because they're cutting off communication entirely and being openly contemptuous. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of emotional harm. The author is in a bad mood after visits and feels drained. They might be protecting their mental health by setting boundaries. However, the question is about right or wrong. So, is it wrong to distance oneself from a toxic parent? Some might argue it's justified, while others might say you should try to maintain a respectful relationship even if you don't like them. \n\nThe mom isn't a perfect parent\u2014she's not involved in the author's life and is critical. But the author's response is also extreme. They're not just being distant; they're actively showing disdain. That could be seen as disrespectful regardless of the circumstances. So maybe the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because respect is expected even if you dislike someone. However, others might argue that the mom's behavior is so bad that the author's reaction is understandable. \n\nBut I think in most cases, even if someone is difficult, showing them zero respect isn't right. The author might need to find a way to set boundaries without being disrespectful. So the answer might be A (Yes, they're in the wrong), but I'm a bit conflicted because the mom's behavior is clearly problematic. However, the question is about the author's actions, not the mom's. The author is treating their mom with zero respect, which is generally frowned upon, regardless of the reasons. So the answer is A.\n"
