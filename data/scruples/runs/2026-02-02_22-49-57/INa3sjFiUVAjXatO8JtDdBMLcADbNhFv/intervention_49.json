My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the writer's mother, who has been a homemaker for 40 years, relying on the father's income. The mother is described as complaining about not having enough money, not showing interest in the kids' lives, and being a negative presence. The writer, who moved out and only visits once a year, treats their mom with zero respect during visits, avoiding interaction and showing disdain.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. The mother's behavior sounds toxic and disrespectful, especially towards her children and husband. However, the children's response is to completely cut off communication and show contempt. While the mother's actions are clearly problematic, the question is whether the writer is in the wrong for how they're handling it.\n\nRespect is generally expected in family relationships, even if the other person is difficult. The writer's approach of ignoring and showing disdain might be a form of self-protection, but it could be seen as disrespectful and harmful. However, given the mother's behavior, some might argue the writer is justified in setting boundaries. On the other hand, completely disengaging without any effort to communicate might not be the healthiest approach, even if the mother is difficult.\n\nThe key points here are: the mother's long-term toxic behavior, the writer's legitimate reasons for frustration, and the writer's response. The writer's actions, while understandable, might be seen as the problem because they're not trying to engage in any way. But considering the mother's actions, the writer's response could also be seen as a necessary boundary.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether treating someone with zero respect is acceptable even if they're at fault. In most cases, even if someone is in the wrong, the appropriate response is to set boundaries without complete rejection. But given the extreme nature of the mother's behavior, the writer's actions might be seen as a reaction to years of mistreatment. However, completely cutting off communication and showing contempt might still be considered wrong because it's not showing basic respect, regardless of the mother's faults. So there's a balance here. The mother is clearly wrong, but the writer's approach could be seen as equally problematic. But since the question is specifically about the writer's actions, the answer might lean towards the writer being in the wrong because they're not making an effort to maintain any respect, even if the mother deserves it. Alternatively, if the mother's behavior is so egregious that the writer feels justified, then the answer would be no. I'm a bit torn, but I think the consensus would be that while the mother is the problem, the writer is not entirely in the wrong for setting boundaries. However, completely disengaging without any effort might be considered extreme. But given the context, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
