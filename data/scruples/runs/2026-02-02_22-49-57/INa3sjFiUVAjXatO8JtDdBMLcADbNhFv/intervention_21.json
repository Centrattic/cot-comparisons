My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for treating their mom with zero respect. The situation is that the mom hasn't worked in 40 years, the dad does most of the work and provides all the income. The mom is criticized for not making more money, complains about her life, and the author finds this repulsive. The author has been cutting their mom off during visits, avoiding conversation, and showing clear disdain.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural context. In many cultures, there's an expectation to respect parents regardless of their behavior. But there's also a lot of debate about healthy boundaries. The author's actions are extreme\u2014avoiding their mother entirely during visits and showing open dislike. That's a big red flag for disrespect.\n\nOn the other hand, the mom's behavior is problematic. She's not contributing, is critical, lacks hobbies, and isn't interested in her children's lives. The author has had to endure this for years. It's understandable they feel frustrated, but the way they're handling it might not be the healthiest approach. The author's response could be harmful to their mom and might prevent any chance of reconciliation or improving the relationship.\n\nThere's also the aspect of communication. The author hasn't tried to address the issues directly, just avoiding their mom. Maybe there's a middle ground where they can set boundaries without being completely disrespectful. But in terms of right or wrong, treating someone with zero respect is generally considered wrong, even if the other person's behavior is awful. So the answer might be A, the author is in the wrong, but I need to make sure I'm not missing anything. The author's reasoning is valid in terms of their mom's behavior, but the solution is not respectful. So, yes, they are in the wrong.\n"
