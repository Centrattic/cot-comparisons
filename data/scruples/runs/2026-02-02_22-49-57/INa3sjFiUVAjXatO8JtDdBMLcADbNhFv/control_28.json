My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the mother hasn't had a job in 40 years since marrying the dad. The dad is the sole provider, doing most of the cooking and cleaning. The mother complains about his income and her lifestyle, acts like a \"petulant child,\" and has no hobbies beyond talking about wealth with friends. She's not interested in the kids' lives and is critical, as seen with the promotion comment.\n\nThe author is visiting once a year from across the country, but their stay is ruined by their mom's behavior. The author is now treating her with disdain, avoiding interaction, leaving the room when she enters, and openly showing contempt.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider both sides.\n\nOn one hand, the mother's behavior is clearly problematic. She's not contributing to the household, is verbally abusive towards the husband, and neglects her children's achievements, replacing them with criticism. The author is under stress and has valid reasons for being upset, especially after enduring this for 20 years and only visiting once a year. The emotional toll is significant, leading to the author's hostile response.\n\nOn the other hand, respect is generally expected in family relationships, regardless of the other person's behavior. The author's actions\u2014open disdain, avoidance, and showing hatred\u2014could be seen as disrespectful. Even if the mother is at fault, the author's response might be considered crossing a line. Respect doesn't mean agreement or affection, but basic courtesy and consideration are usually expected, especially in a family context. The author's behavior might escalate the conflict and could harm family dynamics further.\n\nHowever, the mother's behavior is toxic and has long-term negative effects. The author is in a difficult situation where they're trying to protect their mental health. There's a balance between self-care and maintaining family relationships. The author's approach might be extreme, but their frustration is valid.\n\nAnother angle: cultural expectations. In some cultures, disrespect towards parents is frowned upon, but in others, prioritizing one's well-being is more accepted. The story doesn't specify cultural context, so it's hard to say. But generally, most would agree that open contempt is not the right approach.\n\nPossible solutions could be the author setting boundaries without disrespect\u2014like limiting interaction but maintaining polite engagement. However, the author has chosen a confrontational approach, which might not be the healthiest but is understandable given the circumstances.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author has valid grievances, their response of zero respect and open disdain is likely in the wrong. It's possible to be firm and set boundaries without being disrespectful. The mother's behavior is deplorable, but the author's approach may not be the most constructive way to handle it. Thus, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong), but there's nuance here.\n"
