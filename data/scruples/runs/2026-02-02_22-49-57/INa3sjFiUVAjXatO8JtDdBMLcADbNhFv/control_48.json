My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. So the user is asking if treating their mother with zero respect is wrong. The situation is that their mom hasn't worked since marrying their dad 40 years ago. The dad is the sole provider, and the mom complains about not having enough money, acts like a child, and doesn't care about the kids' lives. The author is really fed up and during visits, they ignore their mom, leave the room when she enters, and openly show dislike. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The mom's behavior is clearly problematic. She's not working, depends on her husband, complains about money, and is dismissive of her children's achievements. The author has had to live with this for 20 years before moving out. The emotional toll is significant\u2014visiting puts them in a bad mood. They're not engaging with her, which is a form of disengagement rather than active disrespect. But they're being openly hostile now.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Respect is generally expected in family relationships, but the mom's behavior is toxic. The author's actions are a response to years of neglect and negativity. However, cutting off communication entirely, especially during visits, might be seen as disrespectful regardless of the mom's actions. But considering the context, the author's actions could be a self-preservation strategy. \n\nIs it wrong to distance oneself from a toxic family member? Some might argue that even if the mother is difficult, showing respect is a moral duty. Others might say that self-care and mental health are more important, and the author isn't obligated to engage in harmful interactions. The answer could depend on cultural norms too. In some cultures, family obligations are strict, but in others, setting boundaries is encouraged.\n\nThe key points are the mother's toxic behavior and the author's justified frustration. The author isn't attacking their mom physically or verbally, just disengaging. While it's not a traditional form of respect, it's a way to protect their own well-being. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the mother's actions have led to this response, and the author is prioritizing their mental health. However, there's a counterpoint that they could handle it with more grace, but given the context, it's understandable.\n"
