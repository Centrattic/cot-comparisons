My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nThe author describes a mother who hasn't worked in 40 years, relies on the father for income, is critical of him, and has no real interests. The author and siblings feel neglected, and the mother is dismissive of their achievements. The author now treats the mother with zero respect during visits, avoiding interaction and showing clear disdain.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother's behavior is definitely problematic. She's not contributing to the household financially, is critical, and lacks empathy towards her children. The author's resentment is understandable given the lifelong treatment. However, the author's response is extreme: cutting off communication, showing contempt, and making no effort to engage. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, while the mother's actions are clearly wrong, the author's approach might be considered harsh. Disrespecting someone, even if they're a parent, can have consequences and may not be the healthiest way to handle it. But the question is about being \"in the wrong.\" The author is reacting to years of neglect and negativity, so maybe their actions are a justified response to the mistreatment they've endured. \n\nHowever, in many cultural contexts, there's an expectation to maintain some level of respect towards family, even if the family member is difficult. The author's complete withdrawal and hostility might be seen as crossing a line, regardless of the mother's faults. But if we evaluate based on the situation's context, the mother's behavior is the primary issue here. The author isn't doing anything harmful beyond expressing their disdain, which could be a form of self-preservation.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong because the mother's actions are the root cause. However, there's a nuance here. The author's approach might not be the best solution but isn't necessarily \"wrong\" in a moral sense. Hence, the answer is likely B.\n"
