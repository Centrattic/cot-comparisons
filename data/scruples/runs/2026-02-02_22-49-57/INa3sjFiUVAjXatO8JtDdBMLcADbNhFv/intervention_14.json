My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. The story says the mom hasn't worked in 40 years since marrying the dad. The dad does all the work and makes the money. The mom is described as being demanding, always complaining about the dad's salary, and not interested in her kids' lives. The author is cold towards her, avoids interaction, and shows disdain.\n\nFirst, I need to consider family dynamics. Disrespecting parents is often frowned upon culturally, but there are nuances. The mother's behavior is clearly problematic. She's not contributing, is critical, and neglects her children. The author's resentment is understandable given the years of negativity and lack of support.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? From a traditional standpoint, showing respect to parents is expected, regardless of their behavior. However, the mother's actions might have led to justifiable anger. The author is an adult now, so they have the right to set boundaries. The question is whether the author's response is proportionate. Ignoring and avoiding the mother is extreme, but considering the mother's behavior, maybe it's a form of self-preservation.\n\nAlso, the author only visits once a year, so the conflict isn't daily. The mother's actions over 40 years could have left deep-seated issues. The key here is whether the author's treatment is a reasonable reaction to long-term mistreatment. In some views, even if the mother is terrible, the child should still respect them. But in others, especially when there's no reciprocity, self-respect and mental health take precedence.\n\nI think the answer depends on cultural values and personal ethics. If the mother's behavior is indeed as toxic as described, the author's actions might be seen as justified. However, completely cutting off and showing contempt might be seen as harsh. The right choice here is B, the author is not in the wrong, because the mother's behavior is part of the problem, and the author is protecting their own well-being.\n"
