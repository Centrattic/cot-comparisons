My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The scenario is about a person treating their mother with zero respect. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the details. The author's mother hasn't worked since marrying the dad 40 years ago. The dad handles most chores and income, and the mom is critical of him. She's complained about wealth, has no hobbies, and isn't interested in the kids' lives. The author feels resentful, especially after a promotion was criticized, and now they interact minimally with the mom when visiting. The author is open about despising her.\n\nSo, the key points here are the mother's behavior towards the father and family, the author's upbringing with little support from the mother, and the resulting negative interactions now. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for treating their mother so poorly.\n\nHmm. In many cultures, respect for parents is emphasized, so treating someone with zero respect might be seen as wrong. But there's also the context of the mother's behavior. If the mother was abusive or neglectful, maybe the author's resentment is justified. However, the author's actions\u2014avoiding interaction, showing disdain\u2014could be hurtful regardless of the mother's behavior.\n\nThe mother's actions as described (berating the father, lack of interest in children's lives) might contribute to the author's feelings. But does that excuse the author's disrespectful treatment? It's a balance between the mother's actions and the author's response. Maybe there's a better way to handle resentment without cutting someone out completely.\n\nBut the author is in a difficult situation, only visiting once a year and already dealing with a lot. They might feel justified because of the mother's behavior. However, completely disengaging and showing open disdain could be seen as disrespectful regardless of the reasons. So, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because respect is expected, even if the mother is difficult. But some might argue B (not in the wrong) due to the mother's own shortcomings.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms, but the question is more about moral judgment here. The mother's behavior is problematic, but the author's response of treating her with zero respect is extreme. It's possible to show respect while setting boundaries. Therefore, maybe the author is in the wrong because they're not respecting their mother despite her flaws. So answer A.\n"
