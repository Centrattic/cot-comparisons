My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. The situation describes a mother who hasn't worked in 40 years, relies on the father for income, and is described as complaining, negative, and uninterested in her children's lives. The author feels resentful and avoids interaction, showing clear disdain.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms around family respect. In many cultures, especially traditional ones, respecting parents is a key value. However, this case involves a mother whose behavior is harmful and neglectful. The author's treatment might be seen as justified if the mother is indeed toxic. But I should also think about the impact of the author's actions. By cutting off completely, even during visits, the author might be causing emotional harm, which could be seen as wrong regardless of the mother's behavior.\n\nAnother angle is the concept of \"hurtful behavior\" vs. \"respect.\" Even if the mother is difficult, responding with zero respect and complete avoidance might not be the healthiest approach. The author could be protecting their mental health, but is it wrong to not engage at all? Also, the father's role here is significant. The mother isn't working, and the father is the sole provider, which might add to the dynamic. The author's resentment could be a mix of their own experiences and the parents' relationship.\n\nI should also consider the mother's perspective. If she's aware of the author's disdain, it might affect her emotionally. But if she's been neglectful and negative, the author's reaction might be a form of self-preservation. However, completely cutting someone out, even a parent, could be seen as extreme. Are there other ways to set boundaries without treating her with zero respect? The author might need to find a middle ground, but the question is whether they're in the wrong now.\n\nIn many ethical frameworks, respect is a two-way street. If the mother has shown disrespect through her actions, maybe the author is justified. But again, treating someone with zero respect isn't justifiable, even if they've been difficult. The answer might depend on balancing self-care with familial obligations. However, since the mother's behavior is described as harmful and the author is protecting their mental health, some might argue the author isn't in the wrong. But others would say that even difficult people deserve basic respect.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author's actions are a response to toxic behavior, but completely cutting off and showing contempt might still be seen as inconsiderate. The answer could lean towards A or B depending on cultural and ethical perspectives. However, in many cases, the expectation is to maintain some level of respect regardless, so the author might be in the wrong. Alternatively, if the mother's actions were abusive, then the author's response is a form of self-defense. The story mentions the mother's negativity and lack of interest, but not abuse. So maybe the author is in the wrong because they're choosing to be disrespectful even if the mother isn't perfect. Hmm, tricky.\n"
