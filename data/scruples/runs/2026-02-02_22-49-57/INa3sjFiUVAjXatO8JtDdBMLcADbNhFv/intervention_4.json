My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the mother hasn't worked in 40 years since marrying the dad. The dad is the sole provider, doing most of the cooking and cleaning. The mom is always complaining about money and her husband's salary, acting like a child. She doesn't care about the kids' lives, and when the author got a promotion, the mom criticized them for taking too long. The author is exhausted from visiting every year and now avoids their mom, showing clear disdain.\n\nThe author's actions are disrespectful\u2014leaving the room when she enters, not talking much, not hiding their hatred. Now, is that justified? Well, there's a history of neglect and criticism from the mother. The author had to endure this for 20 years. But in terms of right or wrong, treating a parent with zero respect is generally frowned upon, regardless of the parent's behavior. However, the mother's behavior is also poor. \n\nBut the question is about the author's wrongness. Even if the mother is awful, the author's response of complete disengagement and disdain might be considered wrong. However, some might argue that the mother's behavior warranted it. But culturally, there's an expectation to treat family with some respect, even if they're difficult. So maybe the author is in the wrong for not showing any respect, even in the face of a difficult parent. Alternatively, maybe not, because the mother's behavior was so toxic. It's a tough call. I think the answer could go either way, but given the instructions to answer A or B, I need to pick one. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I'll have to decide based on the situation. The mother's behavior is bad, but the author's response is extreme. So maybe A (in the wrong) because treating someone with zero respect is not acceptable regardless of reasons. Or B, because the mother's behavior was so bad. I'm leaning towards B, but it's a bit of a grey area. Let me check again. The author's actions are disrespectful, but their reasons are rooted in years of neglect and criticism. However, the answer depends on societal norms. In many cultures, you should respect family even if they're difficult. So the author is in the wrong. But others might say the mother deserved it. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer would be A or B. I think it's a nuanced situation, but the author's actions are disrespectful regardless of the mother's behavior. So the answer is A.\n"
