My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. The situation described is pretty intense.\n\nThe author's mom hasn't worked in 40 years, their dad is the sole provider, and the mom is always complaining about money and not being lavish enough. The author finds this behavior repulsive and has a lot of negative interactions, like criticizing their promotion. The author feels so fed up that they avoid their mom during visits, leave the room when she enters, and openly show disdain. They only visit once a year because they live far away.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural norms. In many cultures, respecting parents is a big deal. The author's behavior\u2014avoiding conversation, showing dislike\u2014might be seen as disrespectful. But then, the mom's behavior is also problematic. She's not contributing to the household, is critical, and lacks interest in her children's lives. The author's resentment is understandable given the mom's actions over 20 years.\n\nHowever, families often have complex dynamics. Even if the mom isn't perfect, the author's response of complete disengagement and open disdain could be harmful. It might escalate tension rather than resolve it. The author might be justified in their feelings but not in their actions. The question is about whether they're in the wrong, so the focus is on their behavior, not just the mom's.\n\nOn one hand, the author has a right to feel upset. On the other, treating a parent with no respect is generally frowned upon. The answer hinges on whether the author's actions are an acceptable response. Since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and the situation is presented as the author's perspective, the answer would likely be A (yes, in the wrong) because they're not managing their resentment constructively, even if the mom is at fault in her behavior. But maybe some would argue that the mom's behavior justifies the author's actions. However, in most cases, society expects people to show respect and manage their emotions, even in difficult family situations. So the answer is A.\n"
