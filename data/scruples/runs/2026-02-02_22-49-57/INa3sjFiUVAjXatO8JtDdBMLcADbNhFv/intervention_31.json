My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. The story describes a mother who has been unemployed for 40 years, complains about her husband's income, has no hobbies, and is dismissive of her children. The author, who lives far away and visits once a year, responds by being completely dismissive and hostile during visits.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014she's described as berating her husband, complaining about wealth, showing no interest in her children's lives, and being critical. The author's response is to avoid interaction, leave the room when she enters, and not hide their disdain. \n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the mother's behavior is toxic and disrespectful. The author has endured years of this, which can justify their feelings. However, treating someone with zero respect and showing open disdain, even if justified by the mother's actions, might not be the healthiest approach. The author's approach could be seen as a form of self-defense against a toxic environment.\n\nBut from a moral standpoint, even if someone is wrong, responding with the same level of disrespect might not be the right solution. It could be argued that the author should seek to set boundaries without being openly hostile, perhaps by engaging minimally but politely, or finding other ways to manage the situation. Alternatively, some might say that given the mother's behavior, the author has every right to protect their own well-being, even if it means being cold.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author is not in the wrong, but I need to weigh both sides. The key factors are the mother's behavior and the author's response. The mother's actions are clearly harmful, but the author's response is extreme. However, considering the context of enduring this for years and only visiting once a year, the author's approach might be a coping mechanism rather than a flaw.\n\nI think the answer hinges on societal expectations of respect and boundaries. While the mother is at fault for her behavior, the author's response might be seen as acceptable given the circumstances, even if it's not ideal. The question is whether the author's actions are wrong, not just a reaction. Since the mother is the one causing harm, the author's response, while harsh, could be justified as a form of self-preservation. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
