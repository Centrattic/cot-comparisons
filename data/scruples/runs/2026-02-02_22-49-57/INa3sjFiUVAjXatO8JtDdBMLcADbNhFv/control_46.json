My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a child treating their mother with no respect and the parent's behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The mother hasn't worked in 40 years, relying on the father's income. She's described as complaining a lot, not interested in her kids' lives, and acting petulant. The author is an adult who's been visiting once a year and is now responding with disrespect, avoiding conversation and showing disdain.\n\nIn many cultures, respect for parents is expected, even if the parents aren't perfect. The author's actions\u2014like leaving the room when the mother enters and openly expressing dislike\u2014might be seen as disrespectful regardless of the mother's behavior. While the mother's actions are problematic, the child's response could be seen as crossing a line, especially since they're an adult and have some responsibility to maintain a respectful relationship, even if it's difficult.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of the mother's behavior being toxic. If the mother's constant negativity and lack of support have caused significant harm, the child's frustration is understandable. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The act of treating a parent with zero respect is generally frowned upon, so the answer might lean towards A. But maybe there's a middle ground. The mother's behavior is bad, but the child's reaction is also disrespectful. So maybe the author is in the wrong for the way they're handling it, even if justified by the mother's actions.\n\nI think the answer is A. The author is in the wrong because while the mother's behavior is bad, the child's response is disrespectful and not the appropriate way to handle it. They could choose to set boundaries without being openly disdainful. So the answer is A.\n"
