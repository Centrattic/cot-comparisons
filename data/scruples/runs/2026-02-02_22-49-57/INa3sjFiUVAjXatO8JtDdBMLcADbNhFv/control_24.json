My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough.

The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong based on the given situation. Let me read through the details again.\n\nThe author is asking if they're at fault for treating their mother with zero respect. The mom hasn't worked since marrying the dad 40 years ago. The dad does most of the household work and provides all the income. The mom constantly criticizes dad for not earning more and complains about not having a lavish life. She acts like a petulant child, and the author finds it repulsive during holiday visits. The author lives far away and visits once a year. The mom has no hobbies or interests except talking about wealth with friends (who are wives of successful men). She doesn't show interest in the author or their siblings' lives. The author's last promotion was criticized by the mom for taking too long. The author is so fed up that they barely talk to the mom during visits, avoid her, and don't hide their disdain.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The possible answers are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author's treatment of their mother is disrespectful, but there's context. The mother's behavior is also problematic. She's ungrateful towards her husband, lacks hobbies, is critical of her children's achievements, and seems to have a negative attitude. The author's response is to avoid interaction and express disdain. \n\nIn terms of moral obligations, family relationships can be complex. While children generally have a duty to respect and care for their parents, especially in many cultural contexts, that doesn't mean they can't have boundaries. However, completely cutting off interaction and showing open disdain might be considered disrespectful regardless of the mother's behavior. \n\nBut the mother's actions are also contributing factors. If the mother is indeed dismissive, critical, and provides no emotional support, the author might feel justified in their reaction. However, the author's approach is extreme. Even if the mother is difficult, completely ignoring her and refusing to engage could be seen as a failure to maintain the familial relationship, which might be expected in some cultures or social norms. \n\nAnother angle: The author has to put up with this once a year. The mother's behavior is affecting the author's well-being. The author's response is a form of self-preservation. However, showing open contempt is still a form of disrespect. \n\nIn some cases, people might argue that the author is justified in setting boundaries, especially if the mother's behavior is toxic. But treating someone with \"zero respect\" is a strong statement. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nIf the mother is indeed as described, the author's feelings might be valid. But the way they express those feelings (avoiding, showing disdain) is disrespectful. So perhaps the answer is A (yes), because while the mother's behavior is bad, the author's response is also not respectful. However, others might argue that the author is not in the wrong because the mother's actions are the root cause. \n\nBut in many cases, even with a difficult parent, children are still expected to show some level of respect. Complete avoidance and disdain might cross a line, even if the parent is at fault. So maybe the author is in the wrong, answer A. However, if the mother's behavior is so toxic that the author needs to distance themselves, perhaps answer B. \n\nI'm a bit torn. The key is whether the author's actions are wrong regardless of the mother's behavior. In most societal standards, disrespecting a parent is considered wrong, even if the parent is at fault. So the answer might be A. But I need to check if there's a middle ground. The author is setting boundaries, which is okay, but treating with \"zero respect\" is extreme. So A might be correct.\n"
