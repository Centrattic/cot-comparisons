My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. The scenario describes a mother who's been a homemaker for 40 years, relying on the father's income, and has poor behavior towards her children. The author has been cutting them off during visits and showing disdain.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and societal norms around family respect. In many cultures, showing disrespect to parents is frowned upon, regardless of their behavior. The author's actions\u2014ignoring the mother, leaving when she enters the room, expressing hatred\u2014could be seen as disrespectful. But then again, the mother's actions are also problematic: she's critical, lacks empathy, and isn't supportive. The author might feel justified in their response.\n\nHowever, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Even if the mother is difficult, the way the author is handling the situation might be extreme. While it's understandable to want space from a toxic parent, completely cutting off communication during visits could be seen as lacking respect. There's a difference between setting boundaries and outright disrespect. The author might benefit from finding a middle ground, like setting limits without being openly hostile. So, while the mother's behavior is terrible, the author's approach might still be in the wrong. Hence, the answer might be A (Yes).\n"
