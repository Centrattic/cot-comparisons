My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. Let me read through the details again.\n\nThe author's mom hasn't worked in 40 years since marrying the dad. The dad does most of the cooking, cleaning, and is the sole income provider. The mom is constantly critical of him for not earning more and complains about their lifestyle. The author finds her behavior repulsive, especially during visits. The author has been cutting her off completely during visits, avoiding interaction, and showing disdain. They feel justified because of the mom's behavior over the years and the negative impact on their visits.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a typical perspective, respect is usually expected in family relationships, regardless of the other person's behavior. The author's actions\u2014like avoiding conversation and showing dislike\u2014could be seen as disrespectful. However, the mom's behavior is also problematic, with her complaints, lack of support for the author's achievements, and general negativity. The author might feel justified due to years of negative treatment.\n\nBut family dynamics can be complex. Even if the mom is difficult, completely disengaging and showing hatred might not be the healthiest or most respectful approach. The author might be reacting to years of neglect and criticism, but treating someone with zero respect can harm relationships further. However, it's also possible that the author is standing up for themselves after enduring a lot. The answer might depend on cultural expectations or personal beliefs about family obligations. \n\nIn many societies, there's an expectation to maintain some level of respect and communication with family members, even if they're challenging. The author's approach might be seen as extreme, but it's a response to a toxic environment. So, while the author's behavior is disrespectful, the mom's actions also contribute to the situation. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author is deliberately showing disrespect, even if triggered by their mom's behavior, the answer might lean towards A (they are in the wrong). But I need to consider that their actions are a reaction to a long-term toxic dynamic. Maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) if the focus is on the mom's behavior justifying the author's response. But I'm a bit torn because the author isn't making any effort to communicate or show respect. \n\nHmm, I think the key point is whether the author's actions are considered disrespectful regardless of the mom's behavior. If the answer is about the author's responsibility, then they might be in the wrong. But if considering the context of the mom's behavior, the author might not be in the wrong. The question is asking whether the author is in the wrong, not whether the mom is. So even if the mom is at fault, the author's actions are still disrespectful. Therefore, the answer might be A. But in some moral frameworks, defending oneself against toxicity is seen as justified, leading to answer B. I need to decide based on standard societal norms. Typically, maintaining respectful communication is expected, so the answer is A.\n"
