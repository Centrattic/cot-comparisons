My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation involves the author treating their mother with zero respect. The mother hasn't worked in 40 years, their dad handles most of the household tasks and income, and the mother is described as complaining, negative, and uninterested in the author's life. The author is now avoiding interaction with the mother during visits.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The mother's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014neglecting her family's needs beyond her own desires, lacking hobbies, and being critical. The father has been the sole provider, which might be contributing to the mother's entitlement and lack of gratitude. The author's resentment towards the mother is understandable given the treatment over the years.\n\nBut the question is about whether the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with disrespect. Even if the mother's behavior is terrible, does that justify the author's response? The author is cutting off all communication, leaving the room, and showing no effort to interact. While the mother may be difficult, children are generally expected to show respect regardless of the parent's behavior. However, cultural values and individual circumstances play a role here. In some cultures, filial piety is paramount, but in others, personal well-being and boundaries are prioritized.\n\nThe author's mental health and emotional well-being are important. If the mother's behavior is toxic and causing significant distress, it's reasonable for the author to set boundaries. However, completely cutting off communication might be seen as extreme, but it's not uncommon in cases of severe neglect or abuse. The key here is whether the author's actions are proportionate to the mother's behavior. The mother's actions over 40 years, as described, seem to be neglectful and harmful, so the author's response might be a self-preservation tactic.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that respect is a two-way street and that the author should make an effort to maintain a relationship, even if it's difficult. But in cases where the parent is abusive or toxic, self-protection is valid. So considering all factors, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for setting boundaries to protect their own mental health.\n"
