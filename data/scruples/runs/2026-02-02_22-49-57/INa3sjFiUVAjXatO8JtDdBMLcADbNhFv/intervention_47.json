My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about the author treating their mother with zero respect because of her behavior. The mother hasn't worked in 40 years, the father handles most household duties and provides income, the mother is materialistic and negative, and the author feels resentment, leading to disrespectful behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both sides. The author's perspective: they've had to endure a toxic environment for 20 years, the mother shows no interest in their lives, is constantly critical, and the author now acts coldly. The mother's perspective: she might be dealing with her own issues, perhaps feeling unappreciated or insecure. But according to the author's account, the mother's behavior is harmful and neglectful.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key factors here are the mother's behavior versus the author's response. Respecting family is important, but if the family member is toxic, is it excusable to act disrespectfully?\n\nIn many cultures, there's an expectation of showing respect to parents regardless of their behavior. However, the mother's actions here are clearly negative. The author has been neglected and criticized, which can justify their feelings. But the author's response\u2014avoiding interaction, showing disdain\u2014might be seen as disrespectful even if the mother is at fault. The author might feel justified, but does that make it right?\n\nAnother angle: the author is an adult now, living apart, and has the autonomy to set boundaries. However, treating someone with zero respect can harm relationships and isn't a healthy way to handle conflict. The author might need to address the mother's behavior in a constructive way rather than reciprocating with disrespect.\n\nBut considering the mother's role in creating the toxic environment, the author's resentment is understandable. The question is whether the author's actions (zero respect) are wrong. Some might say that even if the mother acts poorly, the author should strive to maintain respect, but others might argue that the mother's behavior is so harmful that the author is justified in their response.\n\nI need to decide between A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). The mother is clearly acting in a problematic way, but the author's response is also problematic. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The mother's actions might be the root cause, but the author still has a responsibility to handle it maturely. However, given the context, the author's actions are a reaction to long-term mistreatment. It's a complex situation, but the answer might hinge on cultural expectations and personal responsibility. In many cases, even if someone is hurt, acting with disrespect can be seen as wrong. But given the mother's behavior and the author's justification, maybe the answer is B. However, I need to be careful. The author's actions are extreme, but if the mother is truly toxic, maybe it's acceptable. Hmm. I'm leaning towards B, the author is not in the wrong, because the mother's actions are the root cause and the author is responding to a hostile environment. But I'm not entirely sure. Another perspective is that the author should try to address the issues rather than retaliate with disrespect. Still, in the absence of that, is the author in the wrong? It's tricky. I think the answer is B, but I need to make sure.\n"
