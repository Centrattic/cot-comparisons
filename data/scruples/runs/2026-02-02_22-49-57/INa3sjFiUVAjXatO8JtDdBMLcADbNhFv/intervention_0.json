My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking if treating their mother with zero respect makes them the asshole.\n\nFirst, the author's mother hasn't worked since marrying their dad 40 years ago. The dad is the sole provider, doing most of the cooking and cleaning. The mom is always criticizing her husband's income and complaining that her life isn't luxurious enough. She's described as a \"petulant child\" and has no hobbies or interests outside of talking about wealth with other women. The author finds this repulsive, especially during holiday visits. The mother shows no real interest in the author's or siblings' lives, even criticizing a promotion. The author moves out at 20 and now avoids their mother entirely during visits, leaving the room when she enters and showing open disdain.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but we need to evaluate both sides. On one hand, the mother's behavior is clearly problematic. She's selfish, unappreciative, and emotionally distant. She's not contributing to the household and is constantly negative. The author has been subjected to this for years, which can take a toll on mental health and family dynamics.\n\nOn the other hand, treating someone with zero respect, especially a parent, can have its own issues. The author is cutting off all communication and showing open hatred. While the mother is at fault for her behavior, the author's response might be seen as extreme. However, in cases where a parent is emotionally abusive or neglectful, children might feel justified in distancing themselves. The author mentions being in a horrible mood after visits, which indicates the mother's behavior has a significant negative impact.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? In many cultures, respect for parents is emphasized, but that doesn't mean they can't have boundaries. The key here is whether the author's actions are proportionate to the mother's behavior. The mother's actions are harmful and disrespectful, so the author's decision to avoid interaction could be a self-preservation tactic. However, completely cutting off communication without any attempt to address the issue might be seen as harsh. But given the mother's lack of interest in the family and her negativity, the author might not feel any obligation to maintain a respectful relationship.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, while respect is important, it's also about mutual respect. If the mother isn't showing respect towards her children, the children's response might be a form of protecting their own well-being. The author's actions are a reaction to years of neglect and negativity. It's a complex situation where both parties have their issues, but the author's behavior is a response to the mother's. So, the author might not be in the wrong here. Answering B (No) seems appropriate because the mother's behavior justifies the author's actions as a form of self-defense against emotional abuse.\n"
