My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. The situation is pretty clear: the author's mom has been unemployed for 40 years since marrying the dad. The dad is the sole provider, but the mom is always criticizing him for not making more money and being unhappy. The author finds this repulsive and has a negative attitude towards her, leading to disrespectful behavior during visits. The author feels justified because they've been put in a bad mood and have had negative experiences over the years.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around family respect. Generally, treating family members with disrespect isn't considered acceptable, regardless of the reasons. But there's also the context of the mother's behavior. If she's been unkind and dismissive towards the author and their siblings, maybe that justifies the author's feelings. However, even if someone is a difficult person, the expectation is that you maintain some level of decorum, especially in family settings.\n\nThe author's actions\u2014barely speaking, leaving the room when she enters, openly showing disdain\u2014could be seen as rude and hurtful. While the mother's behavior is problematic, the author's response might be seen as crossing a line. It's possible that the author is reacting to years of neglect and criticism, but acting out in a disrespectful way could harm family relationships further.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is in a situation where they're only visiting once a year, which is a long time between interactions. The mother's behavior is described as negative and uninterested in the author's life, which might contribute to the author's frustration. The key question is whether the author's actions are justified as a response to the mother's behavior. \n\nIn some cultural contexts, there's a strong emphasis on respecting one's parents regardless of their actions. In others, there's more room for individuals to set boundaries, especially if the parent is abusive or neglectful. The mother's behavior seems more on the side of being difficult rather than abusive, but it's impacting the author's well-being. \n\nHowever, the author's response of complete disrespect might not be the healthiest approach. It could be argued that while the mother's actions are inconsiderate, the author could find a way to set boundaries without being disrespectful. For example, engaging in minimal, polite interactions, or not engaging at all without being overtly hostile. \n\nIn conclusion, while the mother's behavior is problematic and the author has valid reasons for feeling upset, treating someone with zero respect is generally considered wrong. The author's actions might be a reaction to a difficult situation, but they're still choosing to act in a way that's disrespectful, which is likely where they're in the wrong.\n"
