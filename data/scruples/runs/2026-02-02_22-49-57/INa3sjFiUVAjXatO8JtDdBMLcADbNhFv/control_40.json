My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this story is in the wrong. The situation is about how they treat their mother, who they describe as being very negative and not supportive.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The mom hasn't worked in 40 years, relying on the dad's income. She complains a lot about money, isn't interested in the kids' lives, and the author feels resentful. The author now visits once a year and is very distant, showing disdain.\n\nThe question here is about whether the author is wrong for treating their mother this way. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nI should consider family dynamics, respect, and the context of the mother's behavior. The author's mother is portrayed as neglectful and critical. The author has a history of negative interactions. However, treating someone with zero respect, even if they're difficult, might still be considered wrong. But there's a context here\u2014maybe the mother's behavior justified the author's reaction. However, the author is actively avoiding and showing disdain, which could be seen as disrespectful regardless of the mother's actions.\n\nBut maybe there's a middle ground. The author's feelings are valid, but their actions might be extreme. However, in some cultures, such behavior from a child is frowned upon. Alternatively, if the mother is unkind, the author might feel justified. However, the author is in their 20s/30s, and even if the mother is difficult, the child's response might not be appropriate. \n\nI need to balance the mother's behavior against the author's actions. The author is in their late 20s or older, given they moved out and got a promotion. They have the right to set boundaries, but treating someone with zero respect is a strong stance. Maybe the answer is A because the author is being disrespectful regardless of the mother's flaws. But maybe B because the mother's behavior is inexcusable and the author is justified in their feelings. \n\nHmm. The key is whether the author's actions are wrong. Even if someone is a bad parent, the child isn't necessarily in the right if they respond with disrespect. However, the author might be justified in protecting their mental health. It's a tricky balance. But the question is about being in the wrong. The author's behavior could be seen as disrespectful, especially if they have the capacity to interact respectfully while maintaining boundaries. So perhaps the answer is A. But if the mother's behavior is so toxic that the author can't be expected to show respect, maybe B. \n\nI think the answer is A. Even if the mother is difficult, treating someone with zero respect and showing open disdain is not acceptable. The author might need to set boundaries without being disrespectful. So the author is in the wrong. Therefore, answer A.\n"
