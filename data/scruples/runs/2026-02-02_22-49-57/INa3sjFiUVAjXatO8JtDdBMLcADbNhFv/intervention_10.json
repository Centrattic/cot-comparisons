My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for treating their mother with zero respect. The author describes their mother as someone who has been unemployed for 40 years, relies on their father's income, is critical of him, and has a negative attitude towards the kids. The author feels so frustrated that they've become disrespectful and avoid their mother during visits. They believe they're not in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The mother's behavior is clearly problematic\u2014being unemployed, criticizing her husband, and not showing interest in her children's lives. The author has valid reasons for feeling upset. However, treating someone with zero respect, even if the person is flawed, is generally not acceptable. The author's actions involve avoiding interaction and expressing hatred, which can be seen as disrespectful.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The mother's behavior is abusive and toxic, so the author's frustration is understandable. However, the author's response\u2014completely cutting off communication and showing disdain\u2014might not be the healthiest or most respectful approach, even if the mother is at fault. There's a difference between standing up for oneself and completely dismissing someone. The author might need to find a balance between protecting their mental health and maintaining some level of respect.\n\nLegally, there's no wrong here, but ethically, it's complex. The mother's actions are deplorable, but the author's actions are also harmful. The key might be in the intent. The author is justified in their feelings but not in their actions. They might not be \"in the wrong\" in the sense of being morally wrong, but their behavior is still disrespectful. It's a tricky line. The answer might depend on the perspective taken\u2014whether the focus is on the mother's faults or the author's disrespectful treatment.\n"
