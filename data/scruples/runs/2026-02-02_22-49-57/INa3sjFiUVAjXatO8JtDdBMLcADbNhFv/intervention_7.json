My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The scenario involves a daughter treating her mother with zero respect due to her mom's behavior. The mom hasn't worked since marrying the dad, who's the sole provider. The mom is described as complaining about money, not engaging with her kids, and being a negative influence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author feels the mom is toxic, neglectful, and negative. She's not showing respect because of her mom's actions. The question is whether treating someone with zero respect is justified even if they're acting poorly.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, respect is generally considered a two-way street. However, if one person is being disrespectful or harmful, the other might feel justified in withdrawing respect. But there's also a societal expectation to maintain family relationships, even if they're difficult. The author's behavior\u2014ignoring her mom, leaving the room, showing disdain\u2014could be seen as harsh, but maybe understandable given the mom's behavior.\n\nI should also think about the concept of respect. Can you respect someone's humanity even if you don't agree with their actions? The author might be arguing that because her mom has been toxic, she's not obligated to be respectful. However, completely cutting someone off might be too extreme. But given the context\u2014long-distance visits once a year\u2014maybe the impact is less, but the approach is still cold.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). Considering the mom's behavior as described, the author's actions might be a reaction to ongoing neglect and toxicity. While treating someone with disrespect isn't ideal, the root cause is the mom's actions. So perhaps the author isn't in the wrong. But some might argue that respect should be maintained regardless. However, given the circumstances, B seems plausible.\n"
