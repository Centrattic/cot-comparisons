My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The story is about a person who treats their mother with no respect, and the reasons behind it.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The mother hasn't worked in 40 years since marrying the dad. The dad does most of the work and provides all the income. The mother is critical of the dad's salary, complains about her lifestyle, and has no hobbies or interest in the kids' lives. The author feels resentment, avoids interaction, and shows disdain during visits. They believe the mother is a negative force and don't want to cater to her anymore.\n\nNow, I need to consider if the author is in the wrong. On one hand, respecting parents is a common value in many cultures. But the mother's behavior is clearly toxic. She's neglectful, critical, and parasitic. The author's response is to distance themselves, which might be a coping mechanism. However, completely cutting off interaction and showing open contempt might be seen as disrespectful regardless of the mother's actions.\n\nBut the question is about whether the author is \"in the wrong.\" It's not just about whether their actions are justified, but if they are morally or socially at fault. In many contexts, respecting parents is expected, but if the parent is abusive or neglectful, the child's anger and distance could be seen as a reasonable response. The line between respect and justified resentment is blurry here. However, the author's public disdain and refusal to engage might be seen as crossing into disrespect, even if the mother's behavior is awful. So there's a balance here between the mother's faults and the child's response.\n\nI think the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong because the mother's behavior is so toxic that the child's actions are a reaction to that. But I need to be careful. Different cultures and values might weigh in. Some might say that no matter the parent's faults, showing respect is required. Others might agree that in such toxic situations, the child's actions are understandable. The key is whether the child's response is proportionate. The mother's actions have been ongoing and harmful, leading to the child's justified anger. However, completely ignoring and showing contempt might be excessive. But given the context, it's possible the author is not in the wrong. So the answer could be B.\n"
