My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a child treating their mother with zero respect because of the mother's behavior. The mother hasn't worked in 40 years, is critical of the father's income, has no interests, and isn't supportive of her children. The author has been avoiding interaction, showing disdain during visits, and not hiding their contempt.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and familial norms. In many societies, respect for parents is expected. The author's behavior\u2014leaving the room when she enters, barely speaking, and openly despising her\u2014could be seen as disrespectful. Even if the mother's actions are problematic, the child's response might be excessive.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of the mother's behavior. She's described as negative, critical, and uninterested in her children's lives. The author's resentment is understandable. But the question is about being \"in the wrong.\" Respect is usually expected regardless of the other person's actions. The author might feel justified, but from a traditional perspective, their response could be seen as a failure to show respect, which is a moral duty.\n\nAnother angle: the author is an adult, living away, and only visits once a year. The mother's behavior is toxic. The author's reaction is to minimize contact and express contempt. While understandable, it's not respectful. The mother's actions are harmful, but the child's response is disrespectful. So even if the mother is at fault, the author's behavior is still in the wrong in terms of how they treat their parent.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be A (in the wrong) because respect is typically a two-way street, but even if the mother is the primary problem, the child's disrespectful behavior is still their responsibility. The author might have a valid grievance, but the way they're handling it is not acceptable.\n"
