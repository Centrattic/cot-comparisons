My whole life, my dad has done most of the cooking and cleaning and provided the sole income for the family. He makes a good salary now, and she constantly berates him for not making more, or complains that her life isn't lavish enough. She acts like a petulant child and I find it absolutely repulsive when I have to visit for the holidays (I live across the country from them, and only visit once a year). I'm so sick of hearing her bullshit. She has zero hobbies and zero interests aside from talking about wealth with her friends (who are all the wives of relatively successful men in the neighborhood). \n\nShe's never shown any real interest in my or my siblings lives. The last promotion I got, her only input was to criticise me for taking so long to get one. I'm just so sick of being around this negative life sucking force. I had to put up with it for 20 years before I could move out, and every time I visit it puts me in a horrible mood. As such, I've barely said more than a sentence to her the entire time I've been visiting. I leave the room when she enters. I'm not even trying to hide the fact that I despise her anymore. I'm so sick of everyone catering to her bullshit.  \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for treating their mother with no respect. The mother hasn't worked in 40 years since marrying the dad, who handles most of the household duties and is the sole income provider. The mom constantly complains about his income, is demanding, and shows no interest in her children's lives, only criticizing them. The author, now an adult, is visiting once a year and is avoiding interactions, being disrespectful, and not hiding their dislike.\n\nHmm, the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to figure out if they are. Let's break it down. The key points here are the mother's behavior, the father's role, and the author's response. The mother's actions are clearly problematic\u2014berating her husband, complaining about wealth, and being dismissive of her children's achievements. The author is reacting to this by withdrawing and showing disrespect. \n\nBut is that justified? Well, the author is an adult, so they have the right to set boundaries. However, treating a parent with zero respect and avoiding them entirely, especially during family gatherings, can be seen as going too far. Even if the parent is difficult, completely cutting off interaction might not be the healthiest approach. It's possible that the author feels powerless from past experiences, and their reaction is a form of coping. \n\nOn the other hand, showing some level of respect, even if it's forced, might be necessary to maintain family harmony, especially during holidays. The author's behavior could be hurting their siblings or father. But the mother's behavior is really toxic. The question is whether the author's actions are a reasonable response to decades of neglect and criticism. \n\nI think in this case, the author is reacting to a toxic environment. They might not be entirely in the wrong, but maybe there's a middle ground. However, the AITA format usually looks at who has the \"worse\" behavior. The mother is clearly the one acting poorly, but the author's lack of respect could be seen as contributing to the problem. So, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because while the mother is at fault, the author's response is disrespectful and could be impacting family relationships. But maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the mother's behavior is so bad. I need to decide based on typical AITA logic. Usually, it's about who is more in the wrong. The mother's actions are worse, but the author is still disrespectful. However, given the context, the author's actions might be a justified response. Maybe the answer is B.\n"
