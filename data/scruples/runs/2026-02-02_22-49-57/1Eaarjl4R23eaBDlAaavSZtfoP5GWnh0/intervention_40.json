Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is they broke up with their girlfriend because she posted on gonewild, which is an adult content site. The author found a post of her there and decided to end the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The girlfriend argues that since it's the internet, it's not cheating. The author, however, felt like this was a betrayal because she was sharing explicit content without his consent. They had an argument where the author felt agitated and ended things. Now he's questioning if he was wrong.\n\nCheating definitions can vary. Some people consider sharing explicit content online as a form of cheating, especially if it's done without the partner's consent. The girlfriend might not see it the same way, thinking it's just her choice as long as it's not with someone else. But the act of posting explicit material publicly could be seen as a violation of trust, especially if the partner isn't okay with it. \n\nThe author's reaction was to end the relationship because she didn't want to stop. That's a personal choice, but was it justified? If the girlfriend was aware of his discomfort and still chose to continue, maybe that's an issue. However, the author could have tried to communicate his boundaries earlier instead of reacting impulsively after finding the post. \n\nAlso, the fact that the girlfriend suggested the author join her for couple posts might have escalated the conflict. The author's friends are upset, but that might not be relevant to the actual issue. \n\nIn terms of cheating, some people might argue that the act of posting isn't the same as physical infidelity, so the author might have overreacted. Others might say consent and trust are crucial, and without consent to share such content, it's a breach of trust. \n\nSo, the author's decision to end the relationship is his choice, but whether he's in the wrong depends on societal views. If the community sees online sharing as cheating, then he's not wrong. If not, maybe he is. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong, considering that he had a right to his boundaries, maybe the answer is B.\n"
