Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after she posted on Gonewild. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author found out his girlfriend was posting explicit content online, which he found unacceptable. He confronted her, she said it wasn't cheating because it's the internet, he got angry, and they broke up. The key points here are about trust, boundaries, and mutual respect in a relationship.\n\nGonewild is a subreddit known for explicit content, so posting there could be a big deal depending on what the couple agreed upon. The girlfriend's argument that it's not cheating because it's online might not consider the emotional impact on her partner. The author felt betrayed and couldn't handle it, leading him to end the relationship. \n\nNow, determining if he's in the wrong. If the couple had no prior discussion about online activities and boundaries, the author's reaction is about his personal limits. However, his approach was confrontational and led to an argument where he said some harsh things. But the core issue is about her actions and his response. \n\nThe author has the right to his own boundaries. If she violated his trust by sharing explicit content without his knowledge, breaking up is a valid decision. The girlfriend's suggestion to do couple posts might have worsened the situation. However, the author could have handled the confrontation more calmly, but the decision to end it because of her unwillingness to stop seems justified. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he acted based on his comfort and trust boundaries, which are valid in a relationship. However, the manner of the breakup could be improved, but the main decision to break up isn't wrong.\n"
