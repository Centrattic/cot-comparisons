Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post did the wrong thing by breaking up with his girlfriend because she posted on gonewild. First, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe guy found out that his girlfriend was posting explicit content online, specifically on gonewild. He was upset, they had an argument, and he ended the relationship. She argued that since it was online, it wasn't cheating. The key points here are about consent, trust, and boundaries in a relationship.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, finding out that his girlfriend is sharing explicit material without discussing it with him might be a breach of trust. Even if she didn't cheat physically, he might feel that her actions are a betrayal of their emotional or sexual boundaries. Relationships require mutual respect and communication. If one partner is uncomfortable with the other sharing such content in public, that's a valid concern.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's stance is that it's her choice and that the internet isn't cheating. She even suggested including him in such posts. However, the author was clearly upset by this. The issue here might be about differing values or expectations. If the author didn't bring up his boundaries before, maybe he's at fault for not communicating his limits. But if she was aware of his discomfort and still continued, that's her responsibility.\n\nThe author's reaction was immediate and decisive. He confronted her, but she didn't take it seriously and instead made suggestions he didn't want. The breakup was his decision based on her not respecting his feelings. Whether he's in the wrong depends on whether he had the right to set that boundary. If he communicated that sharing explicit content online was off-limits, then she broke the agreement. If he didn't, then maybe the breakup was hasty.\n\nBut in the story, he mentions that he didn't talk to her about it first; he just found out and reacted. So maybe he should have discussed his feelings before taking action. However, discovering something that makes him feel betrayed is a strong reason to end things, especially if she's not willing to compromise.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether both parties acted reasonably. The author's decision to break up because of her actions may be seen as justified if he clearly communicated his boundaries. However, if he didn't set those boundaries beforehand, he might be at fault for overreacting. The girlfriend's suggestion to involve him in their posts might indicate she wasn't respecting his discomfort.\n\nI think the key is whether the author had the right to expect that his girlfriend wouldn't share explicit content online without his knowledge. Since it's her content, she has the right to share it, but if it's a deal-breaker for him, then ending the relationship because of her choice is his prerogative. The community often sides with the person who leaves a relationship due to incompatible values, especially if they tried to communicate.\n"
