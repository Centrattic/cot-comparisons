Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who broke up with his girlfriend for posting on gonewild is in the wrong. The question is whether he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to parse the situation. The guy found out his girlfriend had posted NSFW content of herself on a site like gonewild. He was upset, confronted her, and they argued. She didn't think it was cheating because it's online, and even suggested they do couple posts. He broke up with her because she didn't want to stop, and now he's wondering if he was wrong.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to evaluate both sides. \n\nFrom the guy's perspective, finding out his girlfriend is sharing explicit content online could be a major red flag for him. Even if she didn't cheat, sharing such content might make him uncomfortable, especially if it's public. The fact that she didn't want to stop and even suggested he join implies she sees it as a normal or fun activity, which conflicts with his values. Breaking up because of a fundamental difference in what's acceptable in the relationship might be valid. He had the right to set boundaries and leave if those boundaries were crossed.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might believe that posting on such sites isn't cheating. However, sharing explicit material online can have consequences, like exposure without consent if the content is shared further. Her not wanting to stop could indicate a lack of consideration for his feelings. The argument about whether it's cheating might be a defense mechanism. \n\nThe key here is about mutual respect and boundaries. If the guy felt violated or uncomfortable, it's his right to end the relationship. The girlfriend's actions might not be illegal or technically cheating, but in a relationship, both partners need to respect each other's comfort levels. Since she didn't respect his boundaries by continuing, the guy's decision to leave could be justified. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). He made a tough decision based on his values and the relationship's health.\n"
