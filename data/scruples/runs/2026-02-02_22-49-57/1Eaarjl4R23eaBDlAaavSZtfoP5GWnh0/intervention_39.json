Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with his girlfriend for posting on gonewild is in the wrong. The question is structured as an AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario, where people discuss whether they did something wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend found out his girlfriend was posting on gonewild, which is a site for explicit content. He discovered her posts, argued with her, and ended the relationship because she didn't stop. She claimed it wasn't cheating since it's online, but he felt betrayed. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants to know if that's the case.\n\nSo, the key points here are: boundaries in a relationship, honesty, and communication. When someone shares explicit content online, especially involving themselves, it's a personal decision. However, if the partner doesn't agree, it can become a point of conflict. The boyfriend felt she was being unfaithful, even though she didn't physically cheat. But the concept of cheating varies between relationships. Some people might not view online activity as cheating unless the partner is explicit about it.\n\nFrom the boyfriend's perspective, discovering that his girlfriend is posting explicit content without his knowledge could be a breach of trust. Even if there's no physical infidelity, the emotional impact can be significant. The girlfriend's suggestion to do couple posts might have made him feel more uncomfortable, reinforcing his decision to end the relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might argue that she had the right to her own online presence. Unless they had a prior agreement about such activities, she might not have seen it as a deal-breaker. However, the fact that she continued after being confronted could indicate that she didn't consider it a big issue, which the boyfriend did.\n\nIt's also important to consider how both parties communicated. The boyfriend admitted he was aggressive and said some nasty things, which might have escalated the situation. But his decision to end the relationship was based on her unwillingness to change something that clearly upset him. If their values and boundaries are fundamentally incompatible, ending the relationship might be a reasonable step.\n\nIn relationships, consent and mutual understanding are key. If one partner's actions go against the other's boundaries, it's valid for the affected partner to take action. The boyfriend's reaction is a personal choice based on how he felt about her online behavior. Since there's no clear right or wrong in such subjective matters, the author's decision to break up might be seen as justified from his perspective, even if others might have handled it differently.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong because he acted based on his personal boundaries and the lack of communication or compromise from his girlfriend.\n"
