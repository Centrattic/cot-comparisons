Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after finding her posts on gonewild. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation clearly. The girlfriend was posting on gonewild, which is a site known for explicit content. The author found her posts, realized it was her, and confronted her. She argued that since it's the internet, it's not cheating, but he felt betrayed and ended the relationship.\n\nNow, considering cheating. Cheating typically involves a betrayal of trust, but in this case, it's about online behavior. The girlfriend's actions might not be traditional cheating, but sharing explicit content can be a boundary issue. The author might have felt that this violated their relationship's expectations, even if it's not physical infidelity.\n\nCommunication is key here. Were there prior discussions about online privacy or boundaries? If the author didn't talk to her about his discomfort first, maybe he could have handled it differently. However, discovering it this way might have been a shock, leading to an emotional reaction.\n\nThe girlfriend suggested making couple posts, which could imply she wanted to include him in her online activities. The author's reaction\u2014ending the relationship because she didn't stop\u2014might be seen as harsh, but it's his choice if he can't accept her actions. \n\nCultural and personal values play a role. Some people might find online explicit content a deal-breaker, others not. The author's decision is based on his feelings of betrayal, which are valid even if others disagree. \n\nWas the breakup justified? If the author couldn't accept her actions and she wasn't willing to change, then ending the relationship is his right. However, if he could have given her a chance to explain or compromise, maybe there's room for argument. But given the situation as described, where he was hurt and she didn't want to stop, his choice to leave seems understandable.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
