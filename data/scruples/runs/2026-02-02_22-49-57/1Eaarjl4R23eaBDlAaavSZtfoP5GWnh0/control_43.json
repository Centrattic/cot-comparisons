Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he found his girlfriend's posts on Gonewild, which is a site known for explicit content. He broke up with her because he felt it was like cheating, even though she said the internet wasn't cheating. The question is whether he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The girlfriend was posting on Gonewild, which he discovered. He confronted her, got angry, and eventually broke up. She didn't want to stop, so he ended the relationship. He's wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nNow, considering the context. Gonewild is a platform where users share explicit photos, so posting there is a big deal for many people. The author's reaction is based on the idea that sharing intimate parts of herself online without his consent crosses a line. But his girlfriend's stance is that since it's the internet and not a physical act with someone else, it's not cheating. \n\nThe main issue here is about boundaries and mutual consent. In a relationship, both partners usually have expectations about sharing personal content. If the girlfriend was posting explicit material without discussing it with him, that could be a breach of trust. However, the author's response was to break up immediately and not communicate further. Was that the right approach? \n\nHe admitted he said some harsh things during the confrontation. That might have been unkind, but the core issue is whether her actions were okay. If the relationship had any unspoken or spoken agreements about privacy and sharing content, then her actions might have violated those. The author had the right to feel hurt and to set boundaries. However, ending the relationship might be too abrupt unless there was prior discussion about this being a dealbreaker. \n\nAlso, she suggested he join her for couple posts. That could be another red flag, as it's about sharing their intimate moments without his prior consent. If he felt uncomfortable with that, his decision to end things makes sense. But whether he's in the wrong depends on the context of their relationship. If he had never discussed this before, maybe he should have considered her perspective more, but her not stopping implies she's okay with the behavior, which he can't accept. \n\nIn terms of cheating definitions, traditionally it's about physical infidelity, but in modern relationships, emotional or digital infidelity can be considered cheating too. The girlfriend might not see it that way, but the author does. So it's a matter of differing values. He's not wrong for prioritizing his own boundaries and comfort. \n\nThe author's actions: He found out, confronted her, and when she refused to stop, he ended the relationship. That seems like a reasonable step if this was a dealbreaker for him. People have different thresholds, and it's his right to decide what he can't tolerate. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The girlfriend's actions were a privacy and trust issue, and the author acted based on his own values and boundaries. While his approach might have been harsh, the decision to break up isn't his fault.\n"
