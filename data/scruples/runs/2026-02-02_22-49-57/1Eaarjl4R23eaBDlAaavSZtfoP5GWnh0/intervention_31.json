Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author found out their girlfriend was posting explicit content on Gonewild, a site known for adult content. The author broke up with her over it, and now they're wondering if they were wrong to do so.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend was on Gonewild, and she was sharing explicit photos. The author discovered this by accident, clicked into a post and realized it was her. Then they confronted her, and she argued that since it's the internet, it's not cheating. The author felt betrayed and ended the relationship when she didn't agree to stop.\n\nSo, cheating is usually defined as engaging in romantic or sexual activity with someone else without the partner's knowledge. But in this case, she's sharing explicit content online. Is that considered cheating? It might depend on what each couple agrees to. The girlfriend's stance is that posting online isn't the same as meeting someone in person, so she doesn't see it as cheating. The author, however, feels like it's equivalent to cheating because it's sharing intimate content without his consent.\n\nI think the key here is consent and boundaries. If the couple hadn't discussed what they consider cheating, then both might have different views. The author might have felt betrayed because they didn't agree to her sharing such content. On the other hand, the girlfriend might feel that it's her personal space and she's not cheating as long as she's not physically involved with someone else.\n\nBut the author's reaction was to break up after she didn't agree to stop. Was that right? Well, if this was a dealbreaker for the author, then ending the relationship because of it could be justified. However, maybe they should have discussed it more calmly first instead of immediately breaking up. The author admitted to saying some nasty things during the confrontation, which might have escalated the situation. \n\nBut in terms of being \"in the wrong,\" the author is making a personal choice based on their values and comfort. The girlfriend's actions were within her own boundaries, but they crossed the author's. Unless there was a prior agreement that this wouldn't happen, it's not necessarily the author's fault for ending things. People have different standards, and if this was a non-negotiable for the author, then they're not wrong to part ways.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the author acted based on their own boundaries and feelings. The girlfriend's actions might be within her rights, but they caused a conflict that the author couldn't reconcile. The author isn't obligated to stay in a relationship if they feel fundamentally betrayed, even if the betrayal is defined differently.\n"
