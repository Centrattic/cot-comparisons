Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe user is asking if they did the right thing by breaking up with their girlfriend because she posted on GoneWild. The key points here are that the author found out their girlfriend was on a site like GoneWild, which is known for explicit content. The author felt it was a betrayal, even though the girlfriend argued that since it's the internet, it's not cheating. The argument escalated, the author confronted her, and when she didn't stop, he broke up. Now he's wondering if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I should consider what \"cheating\" typically means. Cheating usually involves a breach of trust in a relationship, often involving physical or emotional infidelity. However, sharing explicit content online can be a gray area. Some people might consider it cheating if there's an agreement not to do so, while others might not. The girlfriend argues that since it's online, it's not cheating. But the author clearly felt hurt and saw it as a violation.\n\nNext, communication. The author confronted her after finding out, which is important. But he admitted to being aggressive and saying some nasty things. That could have made the situation worse. The girlfriend suggested they do couple posts, which might indicate that she didn't see a problem with it and wanted to include him, but the author was not okay with it.\n\nThen there's the aspect of consent and boundaries. If the author didn't know about her posts and it was a secret, that could be a breach of trust. But if she was open about it and the author didn't agree, that's a difference in values. The fact that the author couldn't accept her actions and chose to end the relationship is a personal choice, but is it wrong?\n\nAlso, the author's reaction: he waited until morning to confront her, but the emotional impact was clear. The girlfriend's response was dismissive, suggesting it's not cheating. If the author felt that her actions were a deal-breaker, then ending the relationship isn't necessarily wrong. However, maybe there was a better way to approach the conversation, but the action itself might be justified based on their values.\n\nIn terms of whether the author is in the wrong, it's subjective. If the girlfriend didn't break any explicit agreement and the author had no prior discussion about online content, then maybe the author overreacted. But if they had an unspoken expectation of privacy and the girlfriend violated that without consent, then the author's reaction is valid. However, the argument about it not being cheating because it's online is a point to consider.\n\nThe main issue is differing views on what constitutes cheating. The author's decision to break up is his right, but the question is whether he was wrong. Since there's no clear cheating, but a breach of trust in the author's eyes, it's a matter of perspective. The answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong, because ending a relationship over something that one perceives as a violation of trust, even if others disagree, is a personal decision.\n"
