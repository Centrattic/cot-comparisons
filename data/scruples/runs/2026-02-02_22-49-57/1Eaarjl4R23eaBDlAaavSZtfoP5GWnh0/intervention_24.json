Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a breakup after the author found out his girlfriend was posting explicit content on a site called gonewild. The key points are the discovery of her posts, their argument, and his decision to break up.\n\nFirst, the author discovered her posts accidentally when he clicked on a Reddit link and realized it was her. He confronted her the next day, got into a heated argument, and she didn't agree that this was cheating. He felt her actions were a betrayal, leading him to break up. The question is whether he did the right thing.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, finding out that his girlfriend was posting explicit content online, especially without his knowledge, could be a deal-breaker. He felt that this was akin to cheating, even though she argued that the internet isn't the same. His decision to end the relationship might stem from a sense of betrayal and lack of mutual respect for boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's stance is that sharing explicit content online isn't cheating. Some people might view this as a personal choice and her right to express herself, especially if it's consensual. However, the fact that the author was upset about it and felt it was cheating suggests that there was a lack of communication about boundaries in their relationship.\n\nThe author's actions\u2014confronting her, expressing his hurt, and deciding to end the relationship\u2014could be seen as valid if he felt that her actions violated his trust. Relationships require mutual respect for each other's boundaries, and if those boundaries are not communicated or respected, a breakup might be justified. The girlfriend's suggestion that he join her in posting content might have further escalated the conflict, showing a disconnect in their values.\n\nHowever, the author could have handled the situation differently. Instead of immediately breaking up after a heated argument, maybe discussing it calmly and setting boundaries could have been a solution. But given that she didn't want to stop and he couldn't accept that, breaking up might have been the only option for him. The key is whether he acted out of valid reasons and respect for his own values, which he did.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the author's decision to end the relationship seems to be based on his personal boundaries and feelings of betrayal. Therefore, he's not in the wrong.\n"
