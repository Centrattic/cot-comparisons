Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a breakup because the girlfriend was posting on GoneWild, and the author discovered it on Reddit. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author found his girlfriend's explicit content on a site like Reddit (Gonewild is a subreddit for explicit posts). He confronted her, they argued, and he broke up because she didn't want to stop posting. She claims it's not cheating since it's online. The author is now wondering if he's at fault.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether the author was right to break up. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). I need to consider both sides. \n\nOn one hand, the author felt betrayed upon finding her explicit posts. Even though it's online, he might see it as a violation of trust. Sharing such content without consent could be a dealbreaker. Also, she didn't agree to stop, which might lead the author to feel like their values are incompatible.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might argue that sharing content online isn't the same as cheating. The concept of cheating varies between relationships. If they didn't discuss boundaries beforehand, it's unclear if she knew this would be an issue. The author might have acted hastily, especially if he didn't talk about expectations early on. Also, the argument got heated, and he said some harsh things, which could be a point against him.\n\nAnother angle: the author's reaction to her suggestion to join her in posts. That could be a red flag for him, indicating she's not respecting his boundaries. Or it might show she's not considering his feelings. \n\nThe key here is that the author made a decision based on his feelings of betrayal and lack of agreement on this issue. Whether he's in the wrong depends on whether the act of posting such content is a valid reason to break up. \n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are crucial. If the author didn't address this issue earlier, maybe he's at fault for not discussing boundaries. However, if he clearly communicated his discomfort and she didn't respect that, then he's justified. \n\nThe answer might hinge on whether the act itself is considered cheating or a breach of trust. Some people might say that sharing explicit content online is a form of cheating, others not. Since the author felt it was a dealbreaker, and the girlfriend didn't want to stop, breaking up is his right. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because he acted based on his values and the lack of compromise. Therefore, answer B (No).\n"
