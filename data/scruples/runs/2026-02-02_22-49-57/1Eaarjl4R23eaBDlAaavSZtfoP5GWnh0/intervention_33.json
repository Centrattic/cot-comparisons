Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after finding her posts on gonewild. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The guy found out his girlfriend was posting on gonewild, which is a site known for adult content. He discovered this by accident, clicked on a post, realized it was her, and then confronted her. She said that since it's online, it's not cheating. He felt betrayed, argued, and eventually broke up because she didn't want to stop.\n\nNow, considering the key points here. The main issue is whether sharing explicit content online constitutes cheating. The girlfriend's argument is that it's not cheating because it's on the internet. But many people might disagree, especially if the content is revealing or explicit. Cheating can be subjective, and some view sharing such content without consent as a form of betrayal.\n\nThe author's reaction is understandable given the shock and violation he felt. He tried to talk it out, and when she didn't agree to stop, he ended the relationship. Breaking up over this could be seen as a personal choice. If the relationship's foundation included trust and boundaries around such content, then his actions might be justified. However, if there were prior discussions or if he overreacted, it could be a different story. But in the scenario given, he didn't mention prior issues, just this incident. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend suggested doing couple posts, which could be a red flag. The author felt it was too much and ended things, which is his right. The decision to break up is a personal one, and as long as he acted based on his values and the relationship's context, he's not necessarily wrong. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). He had a valid reason based on betrayal and lack of alignment on boundaries. The breakup was a result of differing values, which is a common reason for ending a relationship.\n"
