Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who broke up with their girlfriend over her posting on gonewild is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the situation: the girlfriend posted explicit content online, and the boyfriend found out. He confronted her, they argued, and he ended the relationship because she didn't want to stop. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong.\n\nSo, I need to consider both sides. From the boyfriend's perspective, finding out that his girlfriend is sharing explicit photos, especially without his knowledge, might be a deal-breaker. Trust is a big part of a relationship, and if he felt betrayed or that she wasn't respecting his boundaries, ending it could be his way of dealing with that.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend argues that since it's online and not physical cheating, it's not cheating. But social media boundaries vary a lot between couples. Some people are okay with it, others aren't. The key here is communication. If they never discussed what's acceptable in their relationship, then maybe both sides have a point. However, the boyfriend had a clear issue with it and she didn't want to change her behavior, so he chose to end it. \n\nIn many cases, when a relationship is based on mutual respect and boundaries, if one partner's actions cross the other's boundaries, it's reasonable for that person to leave. The fact that the girlfriend suggested he join her for couple posts might have pushed him further, showing she didn't take his concerns seriously. \n\nSo, considering all that, the boyfriend's decision seems justified based on his own boundaries and the lack of compromise from her side. Therefore, he's not in the wrong.\n"
