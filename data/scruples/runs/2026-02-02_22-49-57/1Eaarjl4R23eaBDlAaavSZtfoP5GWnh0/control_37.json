Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with their girlfriend for posting on gonewild is in the wrong. The situation is a bit complex. \n\nFirst, the girlfriend posted explicit content online, specifically on a site like Gonewild. The boyfriend found out by accident when he saw her in a post. He confronted her the next day, got into an argument, and eventually broke up because she didn't want to stop posting. The question is whether he was in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. From the boyfriend's side, finding out that his girlfriend is posting explicit material online might make him feel betrayed or violated. Even if there's no actual cheating involved, the act of sharing such content could be a deal-breaker for him. He might feel that her actions are a breach of trust or privacy. His reaction of ending the relationship because he can't handle it is his way of dealing with his emotions and setting boundaries.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's perspective is that sharing content online isn't cheating. She might not see it as a big issue and even suggested they do it together. If she didn't consider it a problem, she might feel that the breakup was unnecessary. However, whether an action is considered cheating can be subjective and depends on the couple's agreed-upon boundaries. If they didn't discuss this beforehand, it's unclear what the expectations were. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction, while harsh, is his response to something that personally upsets him. Breaking up is a personal choice, especially when the issue can't be resolved. It's not necessarily right or wrong, but if the boyfriend genuinely can't accept her actions despite her not intending to hurt him, then he's acting on his feelings. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual understanding. If they hadn't discussed boundaries regarding online content before, then both might share some responsibility. However, the boyfriend making a decision based on his comfort level isn't inherently wrong. So, in this case, the answer would likely be B\u2014No, the author isn't in the wrong because he's acting based on his feelings and boundaries, even if the situation is uncomfortable.\n"
