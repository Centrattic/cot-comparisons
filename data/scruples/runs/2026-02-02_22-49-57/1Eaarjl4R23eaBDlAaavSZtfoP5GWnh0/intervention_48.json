Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a breakup because the girlfriend was posting on Gonewild, which is a site for explicit content. The author found her posts and broke up with her because he felt like it was cheating. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of both people. The author found out that his girlfriend was posting explicit photos of herself online, and he took that as a betrayal. His reaction was to break up because he felt it was equivalent to cheating. The girlfriend, on the other hand, argued that since it was online and not with someone else, it's not cheating. She even suggested they do couple posts together.\n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong depends on a few factors. One is the definition of cheating in their relationship. If they never discussed boundaries about sharing content online, the author's assumption that it's cheating might be a misunderstanding. However, if the girlfriend was aware that the author would find it offensive and still did it, maybe she was in the wrong for not respecting his feelings. But the question is about the author being in the wrong.\n\nThe author confronted her, got into an argument, and then broke up. He admitted he said some harsh things. But the main issue is whether his decision to break up was justified. If the girlfriend was aware of his feelings and chose to ignore them, maybe the author was right to end the relationship. However, if he didn't communicate his boundaries beforehand, his reaction could be seen as overstepping, especially if the girlfriend didn't see it as cheating. \n\nIn relationships, both parties are responsible for communication. If the author never discussed what he considered cheating, then maybe he's partly at fault for not setting those boundaries. However, if the girlfriend was posting explicit content and it's something that could reasonably be seen as a betrayal by someone, even if not technically cheating, the author's reaction is understandable. \n\nSo, the answer might hinge on whether the author's expectations were communicated. If he didn't talk about it before, then the breakup might be his fault. But if he had a right to be upset, even without prior discussion, then he's not in the wrong. Since the girlfriend suggested couple posts, maybe she was trying to involve him, but the author felt that wouldn't help. \n\nGiven the information, the author acted based on his feelings of betrayal and the relationship ended because of conflicting views on what constitutes cheating. Since there's no mention of prior communication about boundaries, it's a bit ambiguous, but the author's action was based on his perception. The girlfriend's refusal to stop suggests she didn't see it as a problem, so the author's decision to break up is a matter of personal values. \n\nI think in this case, the author isn't in the wrong because his reaction was based on his feelings of betrayal, even if the girlfriend didn't share that view. So the answer would be B.\n"
