Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a girlfriend who posted something on Gonewild, which the author found out. First, I need to understand what Gonewild is. From what I know, Gonewild is a website that hosts explicit content, including nude or semi-nude photos, often from college parties or other events. So, if she posted there, that's a red flag.\n\nThe author found out by accident when he clicked on a post and realized it was his girlfriend. He felt like she was cheating because she was sharing explicit content online. She, on the other hand, argued that since it's the internet and not with someone else, it's not cheating. The author then broke up with her because she didn't want to stop posting. \n\nNow, the key points here are: Is sharing explicit photos online considered cheating? It depends on the boundaries of the relationship. If they had an agreement that she wouldn't post such content, then she violated that trust. But if there was no prior discussion, the author's reaction is based on his personal comfort. However, the fact that she was posting explicit content without his consent is a big issue. \n\nAlso, when confronted, she suggested he join her for couple posts, which sounds like she's not respecting his feelings. The author's main issue is the lack of consent and the betrayal he feels. In many relationships, sharing explicit photos without the partner's knowledge is a dealbreaker. The author's decision to end the relationship is his way of dealing with the breach of trust. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. He discovered something that made him uncomfortable and felt it was a betrayal. The girlfriend's actions were the main issue here. The author's response, while harsh, is a personal choice based on his values. Unless there were prior agreements that he violated, he's not in the wrong.\n"
