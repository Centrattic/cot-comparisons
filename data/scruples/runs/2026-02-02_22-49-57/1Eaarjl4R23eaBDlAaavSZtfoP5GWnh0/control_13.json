Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who broke up with their girlfriend for posting on GoneWild is in the wrong. The question is AITA (Am I the Asshole) so we need to analyze the situation.\n\nFirst, the guy found out his girlfriend was posting explicit content on a site called gonewild. He clicked on a post and realized it was her. He confronted her, got into an argument, and then broke up because she didn't want to stop. He says she argued that since it's the internet, it's not cheating. She even suggested couple posts. He felt she was cheating and ended the relationship.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. Well, cheating is usually defined as having a sexual relationship with someone else. Posting explicit photos online isn't necessarily cheating, but it can be a violation of trust or boundaries depending on the relationship. The key here is whether sharing explicit content is considered cheating by their agreement. If they didn't have prior rules about this, then technically she didn't break any explicit agreement. However, the guy felt betrayed because he perceived it as cheating. \n\nOn the other hand, the girl's perspective is that she didn't do anything wrong because it's online and not with someone else. But sharing explicit photos can have consequences, like being exposed if the content gets shared without consent. The guy's reaction might be justified if he felt her actions were a breach of trust, even if it's not traditional cheating. \n\nThe guy did confront her and gave her a chance to stop, but she didn't. So he ended the relationship. If the issue is about trust and boundaries, then his decision to break up is a matter of personal values. There's no right or wrong in all cases, but since he felt it was a deal-breaker, he's not necessarily in the wrong for making that choice. However, some might argue that posting explicit content without a partner's consent is a violation of trust. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he had a valid reason to feel betrayed and made a decision based on his values, the answer might be B (Not the Asshole). But others might say he overreacted. However, given the context, his reaction is understandable. So the answer is B.\n"
