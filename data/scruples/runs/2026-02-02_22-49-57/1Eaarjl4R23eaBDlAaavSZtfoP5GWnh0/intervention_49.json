Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author found out their girlfriend was posting explicit content on GoneWild, a site known for adult content. The key points here are:\n\nFirst, the author discovered the posts by accident after a night out and felt betrayed. They confronted the girlfriend the next day, leading to an argument. The girlfriend argued that since it was online, it's not cheating. The author felt the relationship couldn't continue unless she stopped, and she didn't want to, so he broke up.\n\nNow, to assess if the author is in the wrong. The main issue is about boundaries and trust in a relationship. Each person might have different views on what constitutes cheating or betrayal. The girlfriend believed that posting on the internet wasn't cheating, but the author felt it was a violation. In relationships, it's important that both partners have mutual understanding and respect for each other's boundaries. If one partner is uncomfortable with the other's actions, especially something as personal as sharing explicit content, then it's reasonable for them to express that discomfort.\n\nThe author did confront her first, giving her a chance to address the issue. When she didn't agree to stop, he decided to end the relationship. Breaking up because of a fundamental disagreement on such a personal matter isn't necessarily wrong. People have the right to leave a relationship if their values or boundaries aren't respected. The girlfriend's suggestion to join in for couple posts might have escalated the situation, but the core issue was her continued actions against the author's wishes.\n\nHowever, it's also possible that the author could have handled the situation differently, like discussing it calmly without immediate confrontation. But given the emotional context, his reaction seems justified. The key here is mutual consent and respect. Since the author felt betrayed and the girlfriend didn't see it the same way, the breakup is a result of irreconcilable differences. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for choosing to end the relationship when his boundaries were violated.\n"
