Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post was wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she posted on GoneWild. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The guy found out that his girlfriend had posted explicit photos of herself on a site like Reddit's GoneWild. He confronted her, they argued, and he ended the relationship because she didn't want to stop posting. The key points here are trust, boundaries, and communication.\n\nHe says he clicked on a NSFW post and found her there. He was shocked and felt like she was cheating because he didn't agree with her posting. She argued that since it's online, it's not cheating. But he felt it was a betrayal. \n\nNow, whether he's in the wrong. Well, in a relationship, trust is crucial. If one partner does something the other finds unacceptable, the decision to leave is a personal one. The girlfriend might have felt her privacy was invaded when he looked through her history, which could be a separate issue. But the main conflict is about the explicit content. \n\nSome might argue that she has the right to her own content, but if it upsets her partner and they can't resolve the issue, ending the relationship is a valid choice. Others might say he overreacted, especially if she wasn't aware he'd find out or if she didn't consider it cheating. \n\nBut considering that he communicated his feelings and she continued to post despite his objections, his decision to break up could be seen as justified. He tried to address it, and when she didn't comply, he ended things. That seems like a reasonable response if the issue was a deal-breaker for him. \n\nOn the other hand, if he didn't talk to her first and just assumed, maybe he's in the wrong. But the post says he confronted her and they discussed it. Also, she suggested doing couple posts, which might have escalated things. \n\nIn many relationships, what's acceptable varies, and there's no one-size-fits-all answer. But since he felt it was a breach of trust and she didn't see it the same way, their values clashed. So, he's not necessarily in the wrong for choosing to end it.\n"
