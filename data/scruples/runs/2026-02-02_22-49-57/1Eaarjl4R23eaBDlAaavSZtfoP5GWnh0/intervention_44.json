Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe user found out that their girlfriend was posting on Gonewild, which is a site for explicit content. He discovered it by accident when he clicked on a post and realized it was her. They had an argument, he confronted her, she said it's not cheating because it's online, and he eventually broke up with her because she didn't want to stop. He's asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider both sides. The user felt betrayed because he saw her explicit posts. Even though she's not physically cheating, the emotional impact might still be significant. In relationships, trust is important, and if someone does something that feels like a betrayal, it's up to the person to decide how to handle it. The user's reaction was to end the relationship, which is a personal choice.\n\nBut is it wrong to break up over this? It depends on the boundaries they had in their relationship. If they never discussed what constitutes cheating, the girlfriend might have a different view. However, the user's actions were a response to something that made him uncomfortable, and he tried to address it. The girlfriend's suggestion that he join her for couple posts might have made him feel even more uneasy, pushing him to end things.\n\nOn the other hand, some people might argue that posting explicit content online is a personal choice and doesn't necessarily mean cheating unless it's agreed upon otherwise. But the user felt it was a deal-breaker. Since the relationship is between two people, their individual values and boundaries matter. The user acted based on his feelings and the lack of agreement on this issue.\n\nSo, considering that the user tried to communicate, got a response that didn't align with his values, and made a decision to end the relationship, I don't think he's in the wrong. It's his right to decide what he can and cannot accept in a relationship.\n"
