Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her posting on GoWild (a site for explicit content) is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The guy found out his girlfriend had posted on GoWild, which he saw as cheating because she was sharing explicit content. He confronted her, got into an argument, and eventually broke up when she didn't agree to stop. He's now wondering if he was at fault.\n\nSo, the key points here are: 1) Does sharing explicit content on a platform like GoWild count as cheating? 2) Was the guy justified in ending the relationship over this? 3) Did he handle the situation appropriately?\n\nCheating typically involves betrayal or infidelity. If the couple agreed not to share explicit content, then this could be a violation. However, if they didn't discuss boundaries beforehand, the situation becomes more complex. The girlfriend argues that since it's online, it's not cheating. The guy, on the other hand, felt it was a breach of trust.\n\nThe guy confronted her, which is reasonable, but he did mention he said some harsh things. That might have contributed to the conflict. However, his main issue was her continued behavior despite his discomfort, leading to the breakup. \n\nFrom a moral perspective, whether he's right depends on mutual expectations. If the relationship had unspoken or discussed boundaries about online privacy and explicit content, then her actions might be a deal-breaker. If not, it's a matter of differing values. The guy prioritized trust and boundaries, which are valid in a relationship. Ending things because those values weren't respected isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nThe girlfriend suggesting couple posts could be seen as trying to involve him, but the guy felt that was inappropriate. His decision to end it because she wouldn't stop might be justified based on his personal boundaries. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong). People have different views on what constitutes cheating, and acting on his boundaries is acceptable. However, it's a gray area and depends on mutual understanding.\n"
