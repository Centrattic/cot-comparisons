Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who broke up with his girlfriend for posting on gonewild was in the wrong. The scenario is that he found her adult content online and decided to end the relationship when she didn't stop posting. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key factors here. The girlfriend posted explicit content online, which the boyfriend discovered. He confronted her and she didn't agree with his stance, even suggesting they post together. He ended the relationship because she didn't stop.\n\nIn relationships, boundaries are crucial. If the boyfriend felt uncomfortable with her sharing such content, that's his right. However, the line between personal choice and cheating can be blurry. The girlfriend argues that internet posts aren't cheating, which is a common debate. But the boyfriend might see it as a betrayal of trust, especially if he wasn't okay with her sharing personal content publicly.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction was to end the relationship when she didn't comply with his request. That's a significant decision, but it's his choice if he feels it's necessary for his well-being. However, he admitted to saying some harsh things during the argument, which might indicate he acted out of anger. On the other hand, he didn't expose her, showing some consideration.\n\nThe girlfriend's suggestion to join her in posting could be seen as dismissive of his feelings. If she didn't take his concerns seriously, it's valid for him to distance himself. So, while breaking up is a major step, it's his right if the trust was broken. The key is whether sharing explicit content without the partner's consent is considered cheating. Some people do view it as a violation, others don't. Since the boyfriend couldn't reconcile this, ending the relationship isn't necessarily wrong. So, the answer is B.\n"
