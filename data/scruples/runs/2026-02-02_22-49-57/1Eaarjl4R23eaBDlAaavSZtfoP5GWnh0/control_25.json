Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The question is about whether breaking up with a girlfriend over her posting on a site like GoneWild is justified.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The guy found out his girlfriend was posting explicit content online, possibly on a platform like Reddit or GoneWild. He confronted her, they had an argument, and he ended the relationship because she didn't want to stop. The key points here are consent, boundaries, and mutual respect in a relationship.\n\nThe girlfriend argues that posting online isn't cheating. But the guy felt betrayed. The line between personal privacy and what's acceptable in a relationship can be blurry. It depends on their prior agreements. If they had never discussed boundaries regarding social media or online activities, then maybe the guy had a right to feel upset. However, if they had an open relationship or she had mentioned wanting to post such content, maybe his reaction is over the top.\n\nHe says he said some nasty things during the confrontation. That's a red flag. How he handled the situation might have contributed to the breakup. Ending a relationship is a big step, but if he felt her actions violated his trust, it's understandable. The question is whether her actions were a deal-breaker for him. It's his choice, but if there was no prior discussion about such boundaries, maybe he's not wrong for setting that boundary now.\n\nOn the other hand, if she didn't know he'd be upset, she might not have intended to hurt him. But she also suggested he join her for couple posts, which seems like she's inviting him into her online activities, which he clearly wasn't comfortable with. So, she might be in the wrong for not respecting his feelings once he expressed them.\n\nBut the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The author broke up when she refused to stop, which he felt was necessary for trust. If he communicated his boundaries and she didn't respect them, he's justified. But if he didn't set those boundaries before hand, maybe he's at fault for not discussing it earlier. However, the scenario shows he confronted her after finding out. So, maybe it's not his fault for ending the relationship after being hurt.\n\nConsidering all that, the answer might be B (No) because he's standing up for his boundaries. However, some might argue he overreacted, but given the betrayal he felt, it's his right to end the relationship.\n"
