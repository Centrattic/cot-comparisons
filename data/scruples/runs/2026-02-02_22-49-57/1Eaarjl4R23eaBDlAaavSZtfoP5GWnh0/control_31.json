Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author of this AITA post is wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her posting on Gonewild. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The guy finds out his girlfriend has a Gonewild account where she posted explicit content. They argue, and he breaks up because he feels like she's cheating. She says it's just the internet, so it's not cheating. He gets angry, texts her, and when she suggests they do couple posts together, he ends it.\n\nHmm. Well, cheating typically involves deception and betrayal. If she was open about her account and posting there, maybe it's not cheating. But if she kept it a secret, that's different. The guy found out by accident, which implies she didn't tell him. So maybe the secrecy is an issue here. But Gonewild is a public platform, so maybe she wasn't hiding it from everyone, just him? Or maybe she didn't want him to know because she's embarrassed?\n\nHe argues that seeing her explicit content makes him feel like she's cheating. That's a valid emotional reaction. But is that reasonable? Some people might view sharing explicit photos online as a form of cheating, especially if it's done without the partner's knowledge. Others might see it as a boundary issue rather than cheating. It depends on their agreement as a couple. The fact that they didn't have a prior discussion about this could be a problem.\n\nHe broke up over it because she wouldn't stop. He had a right to set boundaries, right? If her actions violated his comfort, he's within his rights to end the relationship. But was he wrong to react so strongly? The key here is whether her actions were a breach of trust. Since she didn't inform him, maybe he's justified in feeling betrayed. On the flip side, if she consensually shared content online without intending to deceive, maybe he's overreacting. But again, the lack of communication is a red flag.\n\nThe girl's suggestion to do couple posts might come off as dismissive of his feelings. She might not realize how hurtful that is. His reaction, while harsh, could be a result of his values clashing with hers. So, is he in the wrong? If the relationship had no prior discussions about boundaries, both parties might have shared responsibility. But since he felt betrayed and she wasn't transparent, he's not entirely wrong to break up. It's a bit of a gray area, but leaning towards him not being in the wrong because he's standing up for his boundaries. But maybe he could have handled it differently. Still, the question is about being \"in the wrong,\" so based on the scenario, the answer is probably B (No).\n"
