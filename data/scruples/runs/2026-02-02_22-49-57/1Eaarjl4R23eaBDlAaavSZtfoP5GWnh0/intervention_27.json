Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about breaking up with a girlfriend because she posted something on GoneWild, which the author considers cheating. \n\nFirst, the key points: The author found out his girlfriend was posting on GoneWild, which he discovered through Reddit. He confronted her, she said it wasn't cheating because it's the internet. He ended the relationship because he couldn't accept that.\n\nNow, cheating definitions vary. Some people consider sexting or posting explicit content as cheating, especially if it's against the partner's wishes. The girlfriend's argument is that since it's online, it's not cheating. But for the author, it felt like a betrayal. \n\nThe author's actions: He broke up with her because he couldn't handle it. He might have been harsh in his approach, but his feelings are valid. If someone's comfort in the relationship is compromised by their partner's actions, even if those actions don't fit traditional cheating, it's a deal-breaker for them. \n\nHowever, the girlfriend might feel that the author overreacted. She didn't see posting online as cheating, so the breakup might be too severe. But relationships are about mutual respect and boundaries. If the author felt violated, he has the right to set that boundary. \n\nThe author's mistake could be in how he communicated his feelings, maybe being aggressive (\"aggy\"), but the decision to end things because of a deal-breaker is his right. So, he's not in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
