Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA scenario. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her posting on gonewild. Let me go through the details carefully.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend posted on gonewild, which the author discovered by accident while browsing Reddit. He found her post and realized it was her. They got into an argument the next day, with the author feeling cheated because she was sharing explicit content online. The girlfriend argued that since it's the internet, it's not cheating. The author felt hurt and ended the relationship when she didn't agree to stop posting. Now he's questioning if he did the right thing.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. The author found out about her posts unintentionally, which might have been a privacy issue. However, she was the one who posted the content, which the author found troubling. In relationships, trust and boundaries are key. If sharing explicit content without the partner's knowledge is a dealbreaker, then the author's decision to end things isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author overreacted. The girlfriend might not have intended for him to see it, and she might have considered her online actions separate from their relationship. However, the fact that she suggested he join her for couple posts after being confronted could indicate a lack of sensitivity towards his feelings. \n\nThe author's reaction\u2014ending the relationship because of her actions\u2014could be justified if he felt it violated their trust. But if there were no prior discussions about boundaries in their relationship, he might have a point in feeling wronged. Alternatively, if he didn't communicate his discomfort with her online activities before, this could be a misstep on his part. \n\nOverall, the key factors are whether the girlfriend was aware that posting such content would affect the author and if the author's reaction was proportionate. Since she continued despite his objections, ending the relationship seems like a reasonable choice. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
