Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA story is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after finding her posts on GoneWild. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the guy found out his girlfriend was posting on a site known for explicit content. He was upset because he felt it was like cheating, even though she argued that since it's online, it's not cheating. He confronted her, got into an argument, and decided to break up because she didn't want to stop. Now he's wondering if he's the asshole here.\n\nHmm. Well, the key factors here are the trust and mutual respect in the relationship. The guy felt betrayed because she was sharing explicit photos online. Even if it's not traditional cheating, sharing private content without consent can be a major issue. But the girlfriend's stance was that it's online, so it's not cheating. That's a big difference in their perspectives.\n\nI need to consider relationship norms. In many relationships, sharing explicit photos with others (even online) is considered a violation of trust. The fact that the guy felt this way is valid for him. However, the girlfriend's position is that she didn't think it was cheating. So, there's a lack of communication about boundaries here. \n\nThe guy broke up because she didn't agree to stop, which suggests that her actions were a dealbreaker for him. If he didn't express his boundaries early on, maybe he's at least partially responsible. But on the other hand, it's her responsibility to respect his feelings once they're communicated.\n\nWait, he confronted her and she suggested he join her for couple posts. That might indicate she didn't realize how seriously he took this. His reaction, while maybe harsh, is based on his personal comfort and the trust in the relationship. If she was sharing content without considering his feelings, that's a breach. \n\nSo, who's in the wrong? The guy had a right to his feelings, but maybe he should have addressed this earlier. However, the breakup decision is his to make if her actions were a dealbreaker. The girlfriend might be at fault for not respecting his boundaries once he expressed them. But if the guy didn't set those boundaries beforehand, he might share some responsibility. \n\nBut given the scenario, the immediate reaction was shock and then confrontation. The key here is whether sharing explicit content online is considered cheating by both parties. The guy's perspective is that it is, hers is that it isn't. The breakup is his choice, so he's not in the wrong for making that decision. He's AITA? Not necessarily. The answer is B (No).\n"
