Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who broke up with their girlfriend over her posting on Gonewild is in the wrong. The scenario is a classic AITA (Am I the Asshole) situation.\n\nFirst, the guy found out his girlfriend had a Gonewild account with explicit posts, including ones that look like her. He confronted her, got into an argument, and broke up because she didn't want to stop. He's wondering if he was wrong to do that.\n\nSo, the main points here are trust and boundaries in a relationship. Sharing explicit content online, especially without the partner's knowledge, can be a big deal. Even if she isn't cheating physically, posting nude photos might be considered a breach of trust. The girlfriend's argument that it's just the internet and not cheating might not hold weight for everyone. Different people have different standards, and if this is a deal-breaker for the guy, he's entitled to that.\n\nBut wait, she wasn't cheating; she was just sharing content. The guy's reaction includes saying some nasty things and breaking up because she didn't want to stop. Did he give her a chance to explain or change her behavior? He did confront her, and she didn't agree to stop. He chose to end things. From his perspective, it's about respecting his boundaries. From her side, maybe she felt her privacy was invaded when he looked through her history.\n\nThe key here is that both have valid perspectives. The guy felt betrayed, even if it's not a physical infidelity. The girlfriend might feel her autonomy was respected, and she's within her rights to post such content. However, since they were in a relationship, there's an expectation of mutual respect and communication about boundaries. If he found her posts unacceptable and she wasn't willing to compromise, ending the relationship could be justified. \n\nBut is he in the wrong? He didn't force her to delete the account; he made his feelings known and followed through when she didn't comply. The question is whether his reaction was overly harsh or if he's justified in prioritizing his comfort. Since he's the one who initiated the breakup based on her actions conflicting with his values, and she wasn't willing to meet him halfway, it's more about differing values than wrongdoing. So, likely, he's not in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
