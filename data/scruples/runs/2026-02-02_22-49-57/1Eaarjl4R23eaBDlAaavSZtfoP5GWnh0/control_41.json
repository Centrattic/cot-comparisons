Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy found out his girlfriend was posting NSFW content on Gonewild. He broke up with her because he felt like she was cheating. But the question is, is he at fault?\n\nFirst, I need to consider what cheating means. Cheating usually involves an emotional or physical affair with someone else. But in this case, the girlfriend was posting on a website, which is public, but not with someone else. However, the guy felt that by sharing explicit content online, she was violating their trust. But does that count as cheating? That's the core issue here.\n\nThe girlfriend's response was that since it's the internet, it's not cheating. But the guy didn't agree. He confronted her, they had a fight, and he broke up because she didn't want to stop. The key points are about consent and boundaries in the relationship. Did they have an agreement about sharing explicit content? If they didn't discuss it beforehand, then maybe the guy's reaction is based on his own boundaries that were violated.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the girlfriend didn't have an affair or physically cheat, but just shared content, does that mean the guy overreacted? It depends on their relationship norms. If they had an understanding that they wouldn't share explicit content without the other's consent, then she violated that. But if there was no such agreement, then maybe the guy's reaction is his own issue. However, even if she didn't know, when someone shares explicit content, especially without the partner's consent, it can be seen as a breach of trust. The guy's feelings are valid if he felt betrayed. \n\nSo, the guy's decision to break up is a personal choice. The question is whether he's in the wrong. The girlfriend's actions might not be traditional cheating, but the guy's reaction is about trust and boundaries. Unless there's a clear agreement about such content, the guy's feelings are his own, and acting on those is his prerogative. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. He had a right to feel betrayed and choose to end the relationship if the boundaries were violated. The answer would be B.\n"
