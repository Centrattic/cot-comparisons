Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with his girlfriend for posting on Gonewild is in the wrong. The situation is a bit tricky.\n\nFirst, the guy found out his girlfriend was posting explicit content online. He was upset and broke up with her because she didn't want to stop. The question is whether he did the right thing.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The girlfriend argues that posting on the internet isn't cheating. But the guy felt it was a betrayal, even if it's online. Trust is important in a relationship. If one partner is sharing intimate content publicly, that could be a dealbreaker for the other.\n\nThe guy's reaction was to confront her, which he admits he did a bit aggressively. She suggested they do couple posts together, which he found unacceptable. He then broke up. Some might say he overreacted, but others might agree that boundaries were crossed.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's perspective is that it's her choice as long as it's online. But if the relationship was exclusive, sharing explicit content online without the partner's consent could be seen as a violation of trust. The key is mutual agreement on what's acceptable in the relationship.\n\nThe guy's actions were based on his feelings of betrayal. While the approach could have been more respectful, ending the relationship because of a fundamental disagreement on boundaries isn't necessarily wrong. It's about whether both partners can meet each other's needs. If not, parting ways is a valid choice.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B. He's not in the wrong because the decision to end the relationship was based on his boundaries being violated, even if the communication could have been better.\n"
