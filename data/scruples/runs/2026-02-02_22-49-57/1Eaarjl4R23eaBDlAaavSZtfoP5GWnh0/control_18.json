Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with his girlfriend for posting on gonewild is in the wrong. So, first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe guy and his girlfriend had been going strong until this incident. He found her on gonewild, which is a NSFW site. He clicked on a post and realized it was her. He confronted her, got into an argument, and ended the relationship because she didn't want to stop posting. His friends are upset with him, and he's unsure if he did the right thing.\n\nThe main question is whether he's at fault. The key points here are the girlfriend's actions versus the boyfriend's reaction. First, posting explicit content online is a personal choice, but sharing such content, especially of oneself, can be a sensitive issue in a relationship. The boyfriend felt it was a betrayal equivalent to cheating. However, the girlfriend argued that since it's online, it's not cheating. \n\nCheating typically involves deception and infidelity, but sharing explicit content without a partner's knowledge or consent can be a form of betrayal. However, if the content is self-produced and not shared with others, the lines can get blurry. The boyfriend's reaction was to break up when she didn't agree to stop, which might be seen as a valid decision based on his comfort level. However, he admitted to saying some harsh things, which might have escalated the situation.\n\nIn relationships, both parties need to have mutual respect and communicate boundaries. If the girlfriend was sharing content without considering her partner's feelings, that's an issue. But if the boyfriend didn't discuss his concerns earlier, maybe he contributed to the problem by not setting those boundaries. Ending the relationship because of this is his choice, but whether he's in the wrong depends on the context of their relationship and agreed-upon boundaries. \n\nSince the girlfriend didn't want to stop, and the boyfriend couldn't handle it, breaking up might be his way of prioritizing his own values. However, the act of confronting her aggressively might have been a mistake. The question is about who's in the wrong. The boyfriend's actions led to the breakup, but his reasons stem from her actions. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nLooking at similar AITA scenarios, sometimes it's about mutual respect and whether one person overstepped. If the girlfriend didn't hide her content and the boyfriend only found out by accident, maybe she didn't cheat, but the content's sharing could still affect trust. The boyfriend's decision to end things isn't inherently wrong if it's about his boundaries. So, the answer might be B (he's not in the wrong) because he acted based on his feelings about her actions, even if the situation is complex.\n"
