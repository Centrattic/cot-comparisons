Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author here is in the wrong. The situation is about breaking up with a girlfriend after finding out she posted something on gonewild. First, I need to understand the key points.\n\nThe author found their girlfriend's post on a site like Gonewild, which is known for adult content. He was upset because he felt she was cheating by sharing explicit material online. They argued, and he ended the relationship because she didn't want to stop posting. The main question is whether he did the right thing.\n\nI need to consider boundaries in a relationship. If the girlfriend didn't inform him about her online activity and he found out by accident, that might be a breach of trust. But then again, if she was posting explicit content, does that count as cheating? Some people might see sharing intimate photos without consent as a violation, even online. However, others might argue that if they were both aware and okay with it, it's consensual.\n\nThe author confronted her, and she didn't want to stop, which led to the breakup. He might be justified if he felt uncomfortable with her actions. But maybe he could have handled it differently, like discussing it more calmly. However, given the emotional response, it's a tough spot. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's suggestion to do couple posts might have crossed a line for him. He might not be wrong if he felt that was a deal-breaker. On the flip side, he could have given her a chance to explain or compromise. But since she didn't want to stop, his decision to end things might be his right. \n\nIn the end, whether he's in the wrong depends on the relationship's standards. If sharing such content was a deal-breaker for him, then he's not wrong. It's about personal boundaries. So I think the answer is B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
