Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her posting on gonewild. First, I need to understand the situation properly. The couple had been dating a while, and the argument arose when the author found one of her gonewild posts. He felt she was cheating, but she argued that since it's the internet, it's not cheating. \n\nHmm, so gonewild is a platform where people post explicit content, often seeking attention or interaction. The author discovered her posts through Reddit, which might have been a mistake since he clicked on something he thought was a random NSFW post but turned out to be his girlfriend. Now, the key points here are consent, trust, and the couple's boundaries.\n\nThe author confronted her the next day, and he was angry, mentioning feeling like she was cheating. She didn't think it was cheating and even suggested they do couple posts together. The author then decided to break up because she didn't want to stop. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, cheating typically involves deceit or betrayal in a relationship. If the girlfriend was posting explicit content of herself online without her partner's knowledge, that could be seen as a breach of trust. However, some people might argue that as long as she's not physically cheating, it's not a deal-breaker. \n\nBut the author felt the same way as if she were cheating. The emotional impact here is significant. The girlfriend might have thought she had the right to be on such platforms, but the author's reaction is valid based on his feelings. The fact that she suggested couple posts might have made the situation worse, as it could come off as dismissive of his feelings. \n\nThe question is whether the author acted in the wrong by breaking up. If the relationship had mutual expectations of monogamy and discretion, then the girlfriend's actions could be seen as violating those. The author's decision to end the relationship because of that might be justified, especially if he couldn't reconcile the breach of trust. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have communicated better before breaking up. He did confront her, but got angry first. However, considering the shock and betrayal he felt, his reaction is understandable. The girlfriend's response of not wanting to stop and suggesting couple posts might have pushed him over the edge. \n\nSo, in this scenario, the author isn't in the wrong. He has the right to set boundaries and if those aren't respected, ending the relationship is a valid choice. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
