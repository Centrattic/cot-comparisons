Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after finding her on a site like Gonewild, which is known for explicit content. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The girl posted explicit content online, which the author discovered. The author felt it was a betrayal, akin to cheating, even though she argued it wasn't. The argument led to the breakup.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, cheating typically involves betrayal in a relationship, but this is about online activity. The girlfriend's stance is that since it's online, it's not cheating. However, sharing explicit content without the partner's knowledge can be a violation of trust, especially if the partner is uncomfortable with it. \n\nThe author confronted her, she didn't take it seriously, and even suggested they do couple posts together. That might have pushed him to break up. The main issue here is trust and boundaries. If the girlfriend was okay with her actions and the author wasn't, their values didn't align. Ending the relationship when there's such a fundamental disagreement might be justified. \n\nOn the other hand, the author did act out of anger and might have said harsh things. But given the context, his reaction seems understandable. The key is whether her actions were a deal-breaker for him, which they were. The question is about being in the wrong, not just whether the breakup was the best choice. Since she violated his trust and he ended it, he's not necessarily wrong. \n\nSo, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The girlfriend's actions were the root cause, and the author had the right to end the relationship if he felt it was incompatible.\n"
