Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of the story is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after finding her on Gone Wild. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The girlfriend posted explicit content online, which the boyfriend found out. He confronted her, had an argument, and ended the relationship because she didn't want to stop. The question is whether he was in the wrong.\n\nSo, what are the key points here? The main issue is her posting explicit content online. The boyfriend felt it was equivalent to cheating, but she didn't agree. He felt betrayed and decided to end things. Now, is his reaction justified?\n\nWell, cheating typically involves physical infidelity or emotional betrayal. But posting explicit content online, even if it's not with someone else, might be considered a breach of trust if it's something the partner is uncomfortable with. However, the line here is blurry. The girlfriend argues it's not cheating because it's online, but the boyfriend sees it as a form of betrayal.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Maybe they didn't discuss boundaries about online activities beforehand. The boyfriend might have had different expectations. If he was okay with her posting, then his reaction could be excessive. But if he wasn't, then she wasn't honest, which is a problem.\n\nHe confronted her, but he admitted he said some harsh things. Ending the relationship because she didn't stop could be seen as his choice based on his values. However, was breaking up the only option? Maybe there's room for negotiation or counseling. But the question is whether he's in the wrong, not if there's a better solution.\n\nLegally, she isn't cheating by posting content. But morally or emotionally, it's a personal boundary issue. If the boyfriend felt this was a deal-breaker, he's not wrong for prioritizing his comfort. But if he didn't discuss this with her before, maybe he should have. However, once the situation arose, his decision to end things because of her non-compliance might be his right.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because he made a decision based on his own boundaries and the situation as he saw it. However, some might argue he could have handled it differently, but the question is about being in the wrong, not the best approach.\n"
