Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author broke up with his girlfriend because she posted on GoneWild, which is a website known for adult content. The key points here are the girlfriend's actions and the author's response.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend posted on GoneWild, and the author found out. He was upset because he felt like she was cheating, even though she argued that posting on the internet isn't cheating. The author confronted her, they had an argument, and he broke up with her because she didn't want to stop posting. Now he's wondering if he did the right thing.\n\nSo, from the author's perspective, he felt betrayed because seeing his girlfriend's content on a porn site made him think she was being unfaithful. Even though she didn't actually cheat, the act of posting her image there might have crossed a boundary he wasn't comfortable with. The girlfriend's reaction was that it's the internet and not cheating, but she even suggested the author join her in making couple posts, which might have made him feel more uneasy.\n\nNow, considering both sides. The author has the right to feel uncomfortable if he believes that posting explicit content online violates their relationship's expectations. Trust and boundaries are important in a relationship. If the girlfriend didn't disclose this before, it could be a breach of trust. However, the girlfriend might argue that it's her personal choice and not cheating. But the act of sharing such content without the partner's knowledge can indeed cause emotional distress. \n\nThe author's decision to break up is his way of dealing with the situation, especially since he couldn't accept it. While he did say some harsh things during the argument, the breakup itself is a personal choice based on his values and how he feels about the relationship. It's not necessarily his fault if he felt that this was a deal-breaker. The girlfriend's suggestion to make couple posts might have been a way to include him, but it's possible she didn't understand his discomfort. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If the author didn't express his boundaries earlier, maybe that's a point of consideration. However, since the issue arose and he couldn't reconcile it, ending the relationship is a valid decision. There's no right or wrong here, but more about personal boundaries. Since the author made his choice based on his feelings and the girlfriend didn't agree to stop, he's not in the wrong for ending it.\n"
