Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend posted a gonewild (NSFW) photo of herself on Reddit. The boyfriend found out, got upset, confronted her, and they had an argument. He broke up with her because he felt it was cheating, and she didn't think it was. Now he's questioning if he did the right thing.\n\nHmm, the key here is about consent and personal boundaries in a relationship. The girlfriend didn't hide her account or keep it secret, but the boyfriend found out through her post. The question is whether the boyfriend has the right to be upset and break up over this. \n\nIn relationships, transparency is important. If the girlfriend shared her account password or made her profile public, maybe the boyfriend's reaction is a bit harsh. But if the account was private and she shared it with someone else, that's different. However, in this case, she posted it on Reddit, which is public. So the boyfriend might not have been aware of her account, and she didn't inform him about her posts.\n\nThe boyfriend's main issue is that he felt she was cheating because the content was explicit. But technically, sharing photos of oneself online isn't cheating unless there's a prior agreement against it. The girlfriend argues that since it's the internet, it's not cheating. The boyfriend, however, felt betrayed and couldn't handle it. \n\nSo, the boyfriend's actions depend on the context of their relationship. If they had an understanding that such behavior wasn't acceptable, then he's within his right to end things. But if there was no such agreement, maybe he overreacted. However, the girlfriend's suggestion that he join her for couple posts after confrontation is problematic. It shows she's not respecting his boundaries, which might justify his decision.\n\nIn summary, the boyfriend's decision to break up is a matter of personal values. If the girlfriend's actions violated their mutual understanding, then he's not wrong. But if it wasn't discussed beforehand, he might be overstepping. However, since the girlfriend continued after being asked to stop, the boyfriend's choice to leave is defensible. So the answer is B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
