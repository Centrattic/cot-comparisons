Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he broke up with his girlfriend because he found out she was posting on gonewild, which is a site with adult content. He stumbled upon her post while scrolling Reddit and realized it was her. Then he confronted her, got into an argument, and eventually broke up because she didn't want to stop posting and even suggested he join her for couple posts. Now he's asking if he's the a**hole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The main issue is whether the girlfriend's actions constitute cheating. He felt betrayed because she was sharing explicit content online. But she argued that since it's the internet, it's not cheating. So, definitions matter here. Cheating typically involves physical or emotional infidelity, but some people might consider sharing explicit photos as a form of betrayal, especially if it's done without the partner's consent or if it's intended to attract others.\n\nThe author found her posts accidentally and was upset. His reaction was to confront her, and when she didn't agree to stop, he broke up. He admitted he said some harsh things. The girlfriend's response was that it's not cheating and even suggested he do it too. So, she didn't see it as a problem, but he did.\n\nNow, is he in the wrong? Well, he didn't cheat, but his reaction was to break up. But maybe he had the right to feel hurt and choose to end the relationship if the behavior was a deal-breaker for him. However, he admitted he said nasty things, which might be a point against him. Also, the fact that she was posting this content on a platform meant for adult content might mean she's aware of the audience. If she was okay with it, but he wasn't, it's a mismatch in values or boundaries.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If he had discussed his feelings about explicit content before this incident, maybe they could have reached a mutual understanding. But in this case, he confronted her after the fact, which might have been too late. However, breaking up because of something that's a personal boundary (for him) is his right. \n\nThe question is whether his action of breaking up makes him the a**hole. If she was aware of the platform's purpose and still chose to post, he can't be blamed for not wanting to be with someone who shares explicit content. However, some might argue that he overreacted or didn't give her a chance to address it. But since she didn't want to stop and even invited him to join, maybe his decision was justified.\n\nSo, balancing both sides, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He set a boundary that she crossed, and he chose to leave. So answer B: No.\n"
