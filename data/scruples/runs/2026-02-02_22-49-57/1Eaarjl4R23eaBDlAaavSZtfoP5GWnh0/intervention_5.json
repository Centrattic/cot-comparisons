Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for breaking up with their girlfriend over her posting on gonewild. The scenario is that the guy found his girlfriend's explicit posts on a site and broke up with her. He says he felt like cheating because she was sharing intimate content online, and she didn't think it was cheating since it's the internet. He ended things because she didn't want to stop.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. Cheating typically involves physical or emotional infidelity, but this is about sharing content. The girlfriend argues that online isn't cheating. However, the guy felt betrayed and uncomfortable. Is sharing explicit content online considered cheating? That's a gray area. It depends on mutual agreements in the relationship. If they never discussed boundaries, maybe she didn't realize it would hurt him. But if the guy felt it was cheating, his feelings are valid. He had the right to set boundaries. Breaking up because of a dealbreaker is his choice. However, his initial reaction of anger and confrontation might have been harsh. But given the situation, he's within his rights to end the relationship if it's a dealbreaker for him. So, the answer is probably B, not in the wrong. The key is whether he transgressed any boundaries. Since the issue was her actions and his response was based on his values, he's not at fault.\n"
