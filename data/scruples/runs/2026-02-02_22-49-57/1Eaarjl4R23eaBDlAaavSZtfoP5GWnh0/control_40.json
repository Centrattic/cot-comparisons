Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she posted on gonewild. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend was posting on a site known for explicit content. The author found her posts without her consent, which probably made him feel betrayed. The girlfriend argued that since it's the internet, it's not cheating. But the author felt it was equivalent to cheating. \n\nNow, the key points here: consent and boundaries. The girlfriend might have thought she was anonymous, but the author recognized her. The act of posting explicit content without the partner's knowledge can be a dealbreaker for some people. The author's reaction is based on trust issues. However, the girlfriend didn't cheat in the traditional sense; she just shared content that the author found unacceptable. \n\nThe author ended the relationship because she didn't agree to stop. Was that right? It depends on mutual boundaries. If the author hadn't discussed this before, maybe he should have talked about it instead of breaking up immediately. But given that they had an argument and she didn't want to stop, the author felt it was incompatible. \n\nIn relationships, expectations vary. If the girlfriend believed it wasn't cheating, but the author felt differently, maybe there was a miscommunication. However, the author's feelings are valid. He chose to end the relationship when he couldn't accept her actions. So, is he in the wrong? Not necessarily. It's a personal choice based on his values. But maybe he could have handled it differently, like discussing boundaries first. But since he did confront her and she didn't change her stance, his decision to break up isn't entirely his fault. \n\nThe answer is B, No, the author isn't in the wrong. He stood by his values even though it's a tough call. The girlfriend's actions violated his trust, leading to a mutual decision to part ways.\n"
