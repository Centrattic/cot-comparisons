Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her posting on gonewild. First, I need to understand the situation thoroughly.\n\nThe girlfriend and the author were in a stable relationship until she posted on gonewild. The author stumbled upon her post while scrolling Reddit, realized it was her, and found her history full of such posts. He confronted her the next day, got into an argument, and eventually broke up because she didn't want to stop. The key points here are about trust, boundaries, and mutual respect in a relationship.\n\nNow, considering relationship norms. In many relationships, sharing explicit content, especially on public or semi-public platforms like gonewild (which is a known adult site), can be a deal-breaker for some people. The author felt it was equivalent to cheating, while the girlfriend didn't see it that way. This disagreement highlights a fundamental difference in how they view fidelity and trust. \n\nThe author's actions: He confronted her, had an argument, and ended the relationship. He mentions he said some harsh things, but he also felt justified in wanting her to stop. His decision to break up was based on his inability to reconcile this issue. \n\nOn the other side, the girlfriend suggested he join her for couple posts, which might indicate she was not fully considering his feelings. If she was aware of his discomfort but still insisted, that could be seen as dismissive. However, she might argue that sharing such content online is her personal choice unless they had prior agreements against it.\n\nEthically, the question is about whether the author overreacted. If the couple hadn't discussed boundaries regarding online behavior, the author has a right to feel violated. However, breaking up immediately after an argument where both parties might have said hurtful things could be seen as impulsive. But given that he couldn't accept her actions as non-cheating, it's a valid reason for him to end things.\n\nIn relationships, it's important for both partners to respect each other's boundaries. If the girlfriend knew the author was uncomfortable with such posts but continued, she might be at fault. Conversely, the author's reaction might be justified if he felt it breached their relationship's trust.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author's decision to break up is a personal choice based on his values. Since the girlfriend didn't want to stop and the author couldn't accept that, ending the relationship isn't inherently wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
