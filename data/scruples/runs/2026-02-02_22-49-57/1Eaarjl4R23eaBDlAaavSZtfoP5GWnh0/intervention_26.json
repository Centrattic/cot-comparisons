Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a breakup due to the girlfriend posting on Gonewild. First, I need to understand the details.\n\nThe girlfriend posted on Gonewild, which is a site for explicit content. The author found out by accident when he clicked a post and realized it was her. They argued, and he broke up because she didn't want to stop posting. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are about consent and boundaries in the relationship. The author didn't know about her posts until he found out by accident. The girlfriend's argument was that since it's the internet, it's not cheating. But the author felt betrayed, leading to the breakup.\n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are crucial. If the author had a problem with her sharing explicit content, even if it's not cheating in the traditional sense, it's a boundary he couldn't respect. The girlfriend didn't ask for his opinion; she just continued, even suggesting he join in. The author felt it was a deal-breaker, which is his right.\n\nHowever, some might argue he should have talked to her earlier instead of waiting after finding out by accident and then breaking up. But since the argument happened and he couldn't accept her actions, ending the relationship might be his way of honoring his own values. So, he's not in the wrong because he had a valid reason based on their communication and his personal boundaries.\n"
