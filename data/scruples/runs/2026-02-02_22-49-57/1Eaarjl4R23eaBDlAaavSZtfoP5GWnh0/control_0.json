Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with their girlfriend over her posting on GoWild was in the wrong. The story is from the \"Am I the Asshole?\" subreddit, so they want a quick A or B answer.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The guy found out his girlfriend was posting on GoWild, which is a site for explicit content. He was upset because he felt it was a betrayal, even though she said it wasn't cheating since it's online. He broke up with her because she didn't want to stop posting, and his friends are upset with him. The question is if he's the asshole here.\n\nSo, the key points are: the girlfriend was sharing explicit content online, the guy felt it was cheating, but she didn't. He broke up after she refused to stop. Now, is he wrong for doing that?\n\nWell, cheating definitions can vary. Some people consider sharing explicit content with others, even online, as cheating. Others might not. The problem here is that their views on what constitutes betrayal differ. The guy felt it was a deal-breaker, while she didn't think it was. \n\nFrom a standpoint of autonomy, the girlfriend has the right to post what she wants unless they had an agreement otherwise. However, if the guy felt this violated their trust, then breaking up because of that isn't necessarily wrong. But if he didn't discuss boundaries beforehand and just reacted after seeing it, maybe he's part of the problem. \n\nAlso, she suggested couple posts after he confronted her, which might have escalated things. But the main issue is whether his breakup was justified. If trust was broken in his eyes, ending the relationship isn't the asshole move. However, if his initial reaction was too harsh without understanding her perspective, maybe he's at fault.\n\nIn many cases, communication is key. If he didn't set boundaries early and then got upset, he might share some blame. But if their values on trust and fidelity differ, then his decision to break up because it's a deal-breaker is valid. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether sharing explicit content online without discussion was a breach of trust. If the guy's values say yes, then he's not the asshole. If the society or community here thinks that's not cheating, then he might be. But given the context, the user is seeking if he's in the wrong. Since he acted based on his feelings of betrayal and she didn't agree, it's a matter of differing values. But in the AITA context, the community often sides with someone who ends a relationship over a deal-breaker, even if others disagree. So the answer might be B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
