Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand it properly.\n\nThe author broke up with his girlfriend because she posted on Gonewild, which he discovered by accident while browsing Reddit. He found her post, realized it was her, and then confronted her. They had an argument, he said some harsh things, and eventually ended the relationship because she didn't want to stop posting. The author is now asking if he was in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the key points here. The main issue is whether posting explicit content on a platform like Gonewild constitutes cheating or is a breach of trust. The girlfriend argued that since it's the internet, it's not cheating. The author disagreed and ended the relationship because of it.\n\nNow, I need to think about the moral and ethical aspects here. In a relationship, trust and boundaries are crucial. What one person considers acceptable, another might not. The author felt that her posting on such a site made him feel like she was cheating, even if she wasn't actually having an affair. The girlfriend's perspective is that sharing explicit content online isn't the same as cheating. \n\nThe author's reaction was to end the relationship because he couldn't accept her behavior. But was that justified? Well, it's about mutual respect and agreed-upon boundaries. If they had discussed and agreed on what's acceptable in the relationship, then breaking up over a boundary violation might be understandable. However, if they didn't have that conversation, the author might have made an assumption that isn't in line with her values.\n\nAnother point is that the author got angry and confronted her in a heated manner, which might have escalated the situation. Communication is key in relationships, and approaching the issue calmly could have led to a different outcome. The author's decision to end the relationship was based on his inability to accept her actions, but whether that's the right call depends on their mutual understanding.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend suggested that the author join her for couple posts, which might indicate that she sees this as a shared activity rather than something she should hide. The author, however, found it unacceptable, leading to the breakup.\n\nIn terms of being \"in the wrong,\" it's a bit situational. If the girlfriend didn't break any explicit rules they had, then the author might be overreacting. On the other hand, if the author felt that her actions were a betrayal of trust, then his reaction is based on his feelings. The question is whether those feelings are valid in the context of their relationship.\n\nI think the core issue is the lack of prior communication about boundaries. Without clear discussions, both parties might have different expectations. The author's decision to break up is his choice, but whether he's in the wrong depends on whether he respected her autonomy versus his own comfort. Since the girlfriend didn't engage in physical infidelity but shared explicit content, it's a gray area. However, the author's actions were based on his personal boundaries, so he might not be in the wrong if he communicated his feelings honestly. On the flip side, if he didn't address it calmly and with understanding, maybe he could have handled it better, but the action of breaking up for that reason isn't necessarily wrong.\n"
