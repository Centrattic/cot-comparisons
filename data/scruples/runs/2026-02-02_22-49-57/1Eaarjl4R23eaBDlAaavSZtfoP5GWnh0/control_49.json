Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong after breaking up with his girlfriend because she posted explicit content on Gonewild. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the girlfriend had a post on a site like Reddit's Gonewild, which is an NSFW subreddit. The guy found out it was her, confronted her, and they argued. She said it's not cheating because it's online, but he felt betrayed. He broke up with her because she didn't want to stop posting, and he couldn't handle it. Now he's asking if he's at fault.\n\nI need to consider both sides. From the guy's perspective, finding out that his girlfriend is posting explicit content, especially if it's from a night out, might feel like a breach of trust. Even if she's not cheating in the traditional sense (no physical contact with others), the emotional impact is real. He felt like she was sharing intimate moments without his consent, which can be a deal-breaker for some people. His reaction\u2014breaking up\u2014could be seen as him prioritizing his own boundaries and emotional well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's stance is that since it's online and not physical cheating, it's not the same. She might feel that sharing content is her personal choice, and she wasn't aware it was a problem. Her suggestion for him to join in might show she didn't realize how seriously he took it or maybe she's trying to include him, but it could also be dismissive of his feelings.\n\nNow, looking at societal norms and relationship expectations. In many relationships, sharing explicit content without consent is a big no-no. Even if it's online, it's a privacy issue. The girlfriend might have assumed it was okay, but the key here is communication. If the guy didn't bring it up before and she was doing it without discussing it, that's a problem. The guy's reaction is about his boundaries being crossed.\n\nThe guy's actions: he confronted her, which is reasonable. He got upset, said some harsh things in the heat of the moment, but in the end, he made a decision based on her not respecting his boundaries. Breaking up because of something that violates his trust isn't wrong per se. People have different thresholds for what's acceptable in a relationship.\n\nPotential arguments against the guy: Maybe he should have talked to her first instead of breaking up immediately. Or maybe he overreacted because he saw her online and not in real life. But the post is about whether he's in the wrong. If the core issue is trust and consent, and she wasn't respecting his boundaries, then he's not wrong to leave. However, if the problem is more about his personal discomfort without discussing it first, maybe he's overstepping. But given the situation, it seems like her actions were a breach of trust, so he's justified.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, he's not in the wrong). He had a valid reason to feel betrayed and making a decision to end things because she didn't respect his boundaries is his right.\n"
