Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after finding her on a site called gonewild. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend had posted content on gonewild, which is known for explicit material. The author found her posts, was shocked, confronted her, and they argued. The girlfriend said posting online isn't cheating, but the author felt betrayed and decided to end the relationship.\n\nNow, the key points here are the definitions of cheating and trust in a relationship. Different people have different boundaries. The girlfriend's argument is that sharing content online isn't cheating, which some might agree with, especially if both partners are aware and okay with it. However, the author felt it was a betrayal, which is a personal reaction.\n\nThe author's actions include confronting her, getting angry, and ultimately breaking up. The question is whether this makes him \"in the wrong.\" Legally, sharing explicit content of oneself isn't cheating, but in relationships, trust and communication are crucial. The author might have felt violated, which is valid if he wasn't comfortable with her sharing such content. However, the way he handled the confrontation\u2014getting \"aggy\" and making demands\u2014could be seen as harsh. Ending the relationship is his choice, but if the relationship is built on mutual trust and communication, maybe he should have discussed it more calmly first.\n\nAnother angle: if the girlfriend was posting content without his knowledge, that's a breach of trust. But if they had discussed and agreed on boundaries, and she still went against them, then her actions might be at fault. The author's reaction depends on their prior agreement. If there was no prior discussion, both might be at fault for not setting clear expectations.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, some people might see the author as justified because the act of sharing explicit content without consent can be a red flag. Others might argue that as long as it's consensual and not a secret, it's not cheating. The girlfriend's suggestion that he join her for couple posts might have pushed the author further, making him feel uncomfortable.\n\nThe author's decision to break up is his right, but whether he's in the wrong depends on the context of their relationship. If he didn't agree to her posting such content, then his reaction is understandable. However, if he was aware of this and okay with it initially, then his sudden reaction might be seen as unfair. The story mentions they were going strong before this, implying this issue was new. So, without prior communication, the author's feelings are valid.\n\nIn summary, the author acted on his feelings of betrayal and lack of trust, which is a personal choice. Since there's no legal wrongdoing, the moral aspect is subjective. The answer hinges on whether the girlfriend's actions were a breach of trust. If the author didn't agree to this, he isn't in the wrong for ending the relationship because his comfort and boundaries matter. However, the way he handled the confrontation could be improved. But the question is if he's in the wrong, not if his method was perfect. Given that, the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
