Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her posting on gonewild is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the key points: The girlfriend posted explicit content online, and the boyfriend found out she was the one in the post. He confronted her, and she defended it by saying internet activity isn't cheating. He felt hurt and broke up with her. Now, the user thinks the author is not wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, sharing explicit content without a partner's consent can be a big deal. It can lead to privacy issues, embarrassment, or security risks. Even if it's on a platform like gonewild, the act of posting such content might be a breach of trust. The boyfriend felt it was cheating because he didn't agree with it, and that's his right to feel. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might have felt it was her choice to share her content privately. However, if they were in a committed relationship, there's an expectation of mutual respect and boundaries. If he was uncomfortable with her sharing, it's an issue of communication. By not discussing this beforehand, she might have ignored his potential feelings.\n\nThe boyfriend's reaction could be seen as justified if this was a deal-breaker for him. Relationships require aligning on what's acceptable. If she continued despite his discomfort, breaking up might be reasonable. However, the way he confronted her\u2014being aggressive and ending things immediately\u2014might be harsh. But given the emotional impact, maybe it's a valid response.\n\nLegally, unless the content was non-consensual in a criminal sense (like without her consent), it's not illegal. But morally, it's a relationship issue. The core is about consent and respect in the relationship. Since he found out after the fact and she was okay with it, but he wasn't, breaking up is his choice. So the answer is B.\n"
