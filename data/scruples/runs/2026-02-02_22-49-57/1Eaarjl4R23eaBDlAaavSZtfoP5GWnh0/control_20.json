Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her posting on GoneWild. First, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe girlfriend posted explicit content on a site like Reddit's GoneWild, which the author discovered. He felt like she was cheating because she was sharing private content online. The key points here are consent, trust, and mutual boundaries in the relationship.\n\nSo, the author found out she was posting without his knowledge. He confronted her, and she argued that since it's the internet, it's not cheating. The author then broke up with her because she didn't agree to stop. Now, the question is whether he's in the wrong for doing that.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, seeing his partner in explicit situations online without his consent might feel like a betrayal, even if there's no physical cheating. The emotional reaction is valid because trust is a big part of a relationship. If one partner is uncomfortable with the other's actions, it's their right to set boundaries. If she continued despite his discomfort, the breakup is a way of protecting his own well-being.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might argue that sharing content online is her choice, and as long as it's consensual and not involving others, it's her freedom. However, if the relationship had an unspoken or spoken agreement that she wouldn't share such content, then breaking that trust could be a reason for the breakup.\n\nThe author didn't act out of malice but because he felt betrayed and couldn't reconcile the situation. Ending the relationship when there's a fundamental disagreement about boundaries isn't necessarily wrong. So, the answer would likely be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
