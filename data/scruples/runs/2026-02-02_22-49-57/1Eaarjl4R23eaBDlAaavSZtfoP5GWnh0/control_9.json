Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she posted on gonewild. First, I need to understand the situation thoroughly.\n\nSo, the author found out that his girlfriend had posted something on a site called gonewild, which I assume is a pornographic or adult content site. He was scrolling through Reddit, clicked a link, and realized it was her. He then confronted her, got into an argument, and decided to break up because she didn't want to stop posting. The key points here are consent, trust, and boundaries in a relationship.\n\nThe girlfriend argues that since it's the internet, it's not cheating. But the author felt betrayed. The question is whether he's in the wrong for ending the relationship. \n\nI need to consider relationship norms. Many people have different boundaries regarding sharing personal content online. If both partners agreed on certain boundaries, then one might be in the wrong if they crossed them. However, if they never discussed it, it's more complicated. \n\nThe author didn't mention prior discussions about online content. The girlfriend's action might be a violation of trust if the author didn't consent to her sharing explicit material. On the other hand, if she believed it was her personal choice and not cheating, she might feel it's not a deal-breaker.\n\nAlso, the way the author confronted her was \"aggy,\" meaning aggressive. He admitted to saying nasty things. That could be seen as harsh, but his actions were a result of discovering something he found unacceptable. \n\nIn relationships, both parties should communicate their expectations. If the author never expressed his discomfort with such posts before, then maybe he's overreacting. But if this is a deal-breaker for him, then his decision to break up is his right. \n\nHowever, some might argue that breaking up over this is extreme unless there's an explicit agreement. Others might say that sharing explicit content without the partner's knowledge is a breach of trust. \n\nSo, the answer depends on whether the girlfriend's actions violated their mutual understanding. If there was no prior discussion, the fault isn't clear-cut. But the author's reaction could be justified if he felt it was a breach of trust. However, his approach was confrontational. \n\nGiven that the user is asking AITA (Am I the Asshole), the community usually looks at whether the person acted reasonably. Breaking up over a disagreement without prior discussion might be seen as hasty, but if the partner's actions were a deal-breaker, it's understandable. \n\nIn conclusion, the answer might be B (Not in the wrong) because he had the right to set boundaries, but some might argue A if there was no prior discussion. The key is whether sharing explicit content was agreed upon. Since it wasn't discussed, it's a gray area, but the author's decision to end things is his prerogative.\n"
