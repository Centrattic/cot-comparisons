Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author of the AITA story is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she posted on gonewild. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The boyfriend found out his girlfriend was posting explicit content on a site called gonewild. He was upset, thought she was cheating, even though she said it wasn't cheating because it was online. He got angry, told her he wanted her to stop, and when she didn't, he broke up with her.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's break it down. The key points here are consent, communication, and boundaries in the relationship. \n\nThe girlfriend was posting on gonewild, which is an adult website. The boyfriend didn't like that and felt it was cheating. But she argued that since it's the internet, it's not cheating. The boyfriend's main issue seems to be that he found out she was doing this without his knowledge, which made him feel betrayed. \n\nIn relationships, trust is important. If one partner is sharing explicit content without the other's knowledge, it can definitely be a problem. But the line between cheating and personal choice is blurry here. Some people might see posting explicit content online as a privacy issue, while others might consider it a breach of trust if it's done without consent from the partner. \n\nThe boyfriend confronted her, and they had an argument. He wanted her to stop, and when she didn't, he ended the relationship. The girlfriend suggested couple posts, which might imply she wanted to continue sharing in a way that includes him. The boyfriend felt that was not acceptable and decided to break up.\n\nNow, the question is whether he acted wrongly. If the relationship had certain boundaries that she broke by posting without his consent, then maybe he's justified. However, if she was doing something that's her personal choice and not affecting the relationship (as she claims), then maybe he overreacted.\n\nBut the key here is consent and communication. If the boyfriend didn't know about her posts and it made him uncomfortable, it's reasonable for him to express that. However, deciding to break up over this might be seen as extreme, depending on the relationship's norms. Some people might think that open communication and setting boundaries could have resolved it without ending the relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, if the girlfriend was aware that discussing such content wasn't okay with him and still chose to post, then the boyfriend's reaction is about protecting his own boundaries. But the girlfriend's perspective is that she didn't think it was cheating, which complicates things.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often look at both sides. The boyfriend had the right to his feelings and boundaries, but the way he handled the confrontation (getting \"aggy\" and saying nasty things) might have been harsh. However, the act of breaking up because of her actions could be his way of saying he can't accept that part of her. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's acting based on his own boundaries and feelings, even if others might see it as overreacting. The girlfriend's actions were a breach of his trust, and he had the right to end the relationship if he felt it was necessary.\n"
