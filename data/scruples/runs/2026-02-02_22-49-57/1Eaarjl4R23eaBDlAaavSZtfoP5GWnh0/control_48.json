Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author broke up with his girlfriend because she posted on a site called gonewild. The key points are: they were in a strong relationship, the author found her post on a porn site, they argued about it, he confronted her the next day, got angry, and ended things because she didn't want to stop posting.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what gonewild is. From what I know, gonewild is a platform where people post explicit content, mostly adult. So the girlfriend posted something there. The author is upset because he thinks she's cheating, but she argues it's not cheating since it's online. The author couldn't handle the idea and broke up. \n\nNow, the question is whether he's at fault. Well, cheating usually involves breaking a commitment in the relationship. If the girlfriend didn't consider online activity as cheating, but the author did, that might be a communication issue. However, posting explicit content on a public or semi-public adult site can be a line that many people consider crossing in a relationship, even if it's not a traditional \"cheating\" with a physical partner. \n\nThe author's reaction was to get angry and break up after she didn't agree to stop. He might be in the right if he felt violated and decided that this was a dealbreaker. On the other hand, he could be in the wrong if the content wasn't actually cheating and he didn't have a clear prior discussion about boundaries. \n\nBut the main thing is, in relationships, boundaries are important. If the girlfriend was posting explicit content publicly, that might not be something the author was comfortable with. Even if she saw it as consensual, the fact that he was disturbed and felt it was a betrayal could be valid. However, the author's approach of confronting her aggressively and ending the relationship immediately without a more in-depth discussion could be seen as harsh. \n\nBut the girlfriend also suggested they do couple posts, which might imply she was okay with sharing their intimate moments online. If the author wasn't okay with that and she continued, then he has a reason to end it. However, if the content wasn't involving anyone else and she considered it part of her personal expression, then the author's reaction might be overstepping. \n\nSo, it's a bit of a gray area. The author's actions might be justified if he felt this was a boundary he couldn't cross. But if the couple hadn't discussed such boundaries beforehand and she wasn't hiding it from him, maybe he's overreacting. Also, the act of finding her content accidentally and then being angry without a prior agreement on such matters might be a point where he's at fault. \n\nBut many people might see sharing explicit content online as a betrayal, even if it's not with another person. So, the author might be within his rights to break up if this is a dealbreaker. The key here is whether the girlfriend was honest about her intentions and if they had discussed these boundaries before. Since the author found it without her telling him, and he was upset, maybe he's not entirely wrong. However, the aggressive confrontation and immediate breakup could be seen as impulsive. \n\nI think the answer would depend on the relationship's dynamics. If they never talked about online boundaries, the author might have a right to be upset, but it's also a personal choice. If he didn't like it and she didn't respect that, then maybe he's right. But if he's making a judgment without understanding her perspective, perhaps he's in the wrong. \n\nHmm. I'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because he had a valid concern and if he couldn't accept her actions, then ending the relationship is a personal choice. The girlfriend was the one who continued the behavior despite his objections. So the answer is B (No).\n"
