Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend over her posting on gonewild. The scenario is that the guy found his girlfriend's posts on a site that's typically for explicit content. He confronted her, they argued, and he ended the relationship because she didn't want to stop posting. He's wondering if he did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend was posting on gonewild, which is an adult site. The guy felt she was cheating because she was sharing explicit content online. He confronted her, but she didn't see it as cheating, which led to the breakup. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are about trust, boundaries, and mutual respect in a relationship. The guy's reaction is based on the fact that he found out about her posts after seeing her in a post. The girlfriend's argument that it's the internet and not cheating might be a point of contention. \n\nIn relationships, what one person considers cheating or a boundary violation might differ. The guy felt it was a violation, and even though the girlfriend didn't, he decided to end the relationship. The decision to break up is a personal choice, but the question is about whether he's in the wrong. \n\nSome might argue that the guy overreacted, especially if he didn't talk to her first before making assumptions. However, the fact that she was posting explicit content online could be a red flag for him. The guy might have felt that this was a deal-breaker, and if they couldn't agree on boundaries, ending the relationship was the right call. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the girlfriend was sharing content consensually (assuming it's her own), but the guy's reaction could be seen as extreme. However, the key is whether sharing such content online is a violation of their relationship's norms. If they hadn't discussed boundaries before, then maybe the guy should have communicated his feelings first. But in this case, he did confront her, and she didn't want to stop, leading him to end the relationship. \n\nThe answer depends on whether sharing explicit content online is considered cheating in their context. If the guy felt it was cheating and she didn't, then their values are incompatible, and breaking up because of that isn't necessarily in the wrong. So the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
