Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after finding out she posted on Gonewild. The scenario is that he found her post on Reddit, specifically on Gonewild, which is an NSFW subreddit where people post explicit content. He was upset because he felt it was like cheating, even though she said it wasn't. He confronted her, they had an argument, and he broke up with her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The key points are: she posted explicit content online, he found out through a subreddit, he felt it was cheating, she didn't see it that way, and he ended the relationship. \n\nCheating typically involves physical infidelity or emotional betrayal. However, sharing explicit content online might be a gray area. Some people might consider it a violation of trust if it's done without the partner's knowledge or consent. The girlfriend might have thought it was okay since it's online, but the author didn't agree. \n\nThe author's reaction: he texted her in the morning, got angry, said some harsh things, and eventually broke up. The girlfriend suggested making it a couple thing, implying she might want him to join in, which he refused. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he had the right to feel betrayed, but his approach might have been harsh. He didn't give her a chance to explain initially because he was angry. Also, breaking up immediately might be a quick reaction. However, if their communication was poor and she didn't want to stop, maybe ending the relationship is reasonable if they can't agree on boundaries.\n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend's perspective. She might not see posting on Gonewild as cheating, but the author does. This is a communication issue. If the author felt uncomfortable with her online activities and didn't discuss boundaries earlier, maybe he's at least partly responsible for not addressing it sooner. However, once he found out, he had the right to set his own boundaries. \n\nIn relationships, trust is crucial. If one partner does something that makes the other feel uncomfortable or untrustworthy, it's a valid reason to reassess the relationship. The author might not be in the wrong for breaking up, especially if they couldn't come to a mutual understanding. But his handling of the situation\u2014being aggressive and not listening to her perspective\u2014could be problematic. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong for breaking up, not necessarily his handling of the confrontation. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's decision to end the relationship because her actions went against his values might not be wrong. People have different boundaries, and if they can't agree, parting ways is a valid choice. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
