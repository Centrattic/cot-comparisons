Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author broke up with his girlfriend because she posted explicit content of herself on a site called Gonewild. The user is asking if they're the asshole for doing so.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The girlfriend posted explicit material online. The author found out about it through Reddit, saw it was her, and confronted her. She argued that since it's the internet, it's not cheating. The author felt it was a dealbreaker, leading to the breakup.\n\nNow, whether the author is in the wrong depends on various factors. Let's break it down. \n\nFrom the author's perspective: He found out his girlfriend shared explicit photos of herself online, which he perceived as a betrayal. He might feel that sharing such content without his consent is a violation of trust. Even if she's not cheating in the traditional sense (like with another person), he might see it as a breach of their relationship's boundaries. The fact that she suggested they do couple posts together could have made him feel even more uncomfortable, possibly seeing it as her pushing him into something he's not okay with. Ending the relationship because of this could be his way of setting a boundary if he can't accept that aspect of her behavior.\n\nFrom the girlfriend's side: She might view her own explicit content as a personal choice. She might not see posting it as cheating, especially if there's no physical or emotional infidelity involved. She could argue that as long as she's not being unfaithful, it's her body and her decision. If the couple had not discussed boundaries regarding such content beforehand, she might not have realized it would be a problem.\n\nNow, considering relationship dynamics. Communication is key. If the author never discussed his feelings about her sharing explicit content before, it's possible he's overreacting. However, if this is a dealbreaker for him, it's his right to end the relationship. On the other hand, if she didn't know it would upset him, maybe she should have considered his feelings before posting. But she's also within her rights to make personal choices unless they directly harm him (like if he found out later and felt betrayed).\n\nThe term \"cheating\" is often about infidelity, but in this case, she's not cheating with someone else. So her argument that it's not cheating might hold some ground. However, the author's emotional response is valid because he feels hurt and betrayed regardless of the technical definition.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the relationship's boundaries were not clearly communicated, maybe he's being too harsh. But if this is something he can't accept, then ending the relationship is his choice. It's a personal decision, but he might be overreacting if she wasn't being unfaithful. Alternatively, if he values her not sharing explicit content and she refuses to respect that, then his reaction is justified.\n\nIn terms of societal views, some people might say that creating and sharing explicit content is a personal choice and not the partner's business unless there's a prior agreement. Others might see it as a breach of trust if the partner is uncomfortable with it. There's no black and white here, but the author's actions are based on his own boundaries. If he's clear that this is a dealbreaker, then he's not necessarily in the wrong for ending the relationship. However, the initial reaction of getting angry and saying nasty things might not be the healthiest approach, but the decision to break up could be seen as his right.\n"
