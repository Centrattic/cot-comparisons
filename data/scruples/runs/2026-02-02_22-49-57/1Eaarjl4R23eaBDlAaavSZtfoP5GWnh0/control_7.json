Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after finding her on a porn site called gonewild. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend posted explicit content online, and the boyfriend discovered it on Reddit. They had a big argument, and the boyfriend ended the relationship because he felt she was cheating, even though she argued that posting online isn't cheating. \n\nSo, the key points here are: 1) The girlfriend posted explicit content online, 2) The boyfriend found out and felt betrayed, 3) The girlfriend didn't want to stop posting, 4) The boyfriend ended the relationship. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author (the boyfriend) is in the wrong. \n\nI should consider both sides. From the boyfriend's perspective, discovering his partner in explicit content online might be a deal-breaker. Even if she didn't cheat in a traditional sense, sharing such content without consent can be a violation of trust. People have different boundaries in relationships, and for some, this is a red line. The boyfriend felt that her actions were equivalent to cheating, which is a common perception in many relationships. His decision to end the relationship because she refused to stop might be seen as valid if he felt that her actions were incompatible with their relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might argue that posting online isn't cheating, which is a viewpoint some people hold. However, the problem is that the boyfriend did not agree with her stance. In relationships, mutual respect for each other's boundaries is crucial. If the boyfriend felt uncomfortable and the girlfriend refused to meet him halfway, that's a breakdown in communication and mutual respect. \n\nThe boyfriend's reaction, while harsh, might be justified given his feelings. Ending a relationship because of a fundamental disagreement on such a sensitive issue is a personal choice. The girlfriend's suggestion to do couple posts together might have crossed another boundary, making the situation worse. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the boyfriend overreacted, especially if there was no actual infidelity. But trust is a cornerstone of relationships, and for the boyfriend, this breach of trust (even if it's online) was significant enough to end things. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely B (No), the author is not in the wrong. He acted based on his boundaries and values, which the girlfriend wasn't willing to respect, leading him to end the relationship. The wrong here would be more on the girlfriend for sharing content that caused such conflict without considering her partner's feelings.\n"
