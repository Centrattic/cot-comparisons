Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with their girlfriend for posting on Gonewild is in the wrong. The situation is that the author found out their girlfriend had posted explicit content of herself online, which he considered cheating. They had an argument, and he ended things because she didn't want to stop posting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of cheating. Cheating typically involves a betrayal of trust, usually involving a sexual relationship with someone else. However, in this case, the girlfriend was posting explicit photos of herself online but not engaging in a physical relationship with someone else. She argues that since it's the internet, it's not cheating. The author, on the other hand, feels betrayed and that her actions are a form of infidelity.\n\nNow, different people have different boundaries. Some might consider sharing explicit content as cheating because it involves exposing oneself to others without their partner's knowledge, which can be a violation of trust. Others might not see it that way, especially if there's no physical or emotional involvement with another person. The key here is the mutual understanding of what constitutes cheating. If the couple never discussed this boundary, it's possible both acted without full awareness.\n\nThe author confronted her, but he admits he said some harsh things. His decision to break up was based on her refusal to stop. He didn't give her a chance to explain further or work through the issue. Maybe there's a lack of communication here. However, he did express his feelings and set a boundary. If the girlfriend was unwilling to respect his boundaries, then ending the relationship might be his right.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend suggested making it a couple activity, which might be her way of trying to resolve the issue. But if the author wasn't comfortable with that, it's understandable he would end things. The main question is whether the act of posting explicit content online is a deal-breaker. It's subjective, but the author felt it was, and he acted on his feelings.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He made a decision based on his values and boundaries. However, the situation is complex, and there's no clear right or wrong answer. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer would be B (No).\n"
