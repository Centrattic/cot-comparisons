Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who broke up with their girlfriend over her posting on GoneWild is in the wrong. The question is whether the author is at fault. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author found out their girlfriend was posting explicit content online, specifically on a site like Reddit's GoneWild. They confronted her, got into an argument, and ended the relationship because she didn't want to stop. The girlfriend argues that since it's the internet, it's not cheating. The author is wondering if they're in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that they felt betrayed and uncomfortable with their partner sharing explicit material online. They felt it was akin to cheating, even if it's just on the internet. The girlfriend's stance is that sharing on the internet isn't the same as physical cheating, so the author overreacted.\n\nLegally, sharing explicit content without consent can be problematic, but here the girlfriend was the one posting her own content. So from a legal standpoint, maybe she has a right to do that. But in a relationship, trust and boundaries are crucial. The key here is mutual agreement on what's acceptable. If the author found this unacceptable, and the girlfriend wasn't willing to compromise, then ending the relationship could be a valid decision.\n\nThe author did confront her first, gave her a chance to stop, but she didn't. The fact that she suggested including him in such posts might have been the last straw. The author's decision to end things because of a fundamental disagreement on boundaries could be seen as justified. However, some might argue that the author could have handled it differently, like discussing it more calmly or seeking counseling, but given the emotional response and the girlfriend's refusal to change, the breakup might be the right call.\n\nSo, considering that the author stood up for their boundaries and the girlfriend wasn't willing to respect them, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The relationship might have been incompatible on this issue, leading to a necessary parting.\n"
