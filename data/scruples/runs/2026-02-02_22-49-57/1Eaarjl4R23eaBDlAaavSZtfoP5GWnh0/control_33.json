Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for breaking up with their girlfriend after she posted on GoneWild. So first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe user found out their girlfriend was on a site like Reddit's GoneWild, which is for explicit content. They stumbled upon her post by accident while scrolling, realized it was her, and confronted her. The girlfriend didn't think it was cheating because it's online, but the user felt hurt and ended the relationship. The question is whether the user was wrong to break up.\n\nHmm. Well, cheating definitions vary. Some people consider sharing explicit content online as cheating, others don't. The girlfriend's stance was that since it's the internet, it's not cheating. The user felt it was a betrayal, so they ended the relationship. \n\nThe user might have overreacted, but the girlfriend's actions could be seen as a boundary issue. If the user didn't know about this before, it's a big deal. The user had the right to feel hurt and decide the relationship wasn't right for them. Breaking up is a personal choice, so whether they're in the wrong depends on their values and what they agreed on in the relationship. Since there was no prior agreement about online activities, the user's reaction is understandable. So I think the answer is B, the user isn't in the wrong.\n"
