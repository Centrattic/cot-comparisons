Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author did the wrong thing here. So the situation is that the guy found out his girlfriend was posting explicit content on gonewild, which is a site known for user-submitted explicit material. He confronted her, they argued, and he broke up because she didn't want to stop posting. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend was posting on a site that's not exactly a mainstream platform; it's for explicit content. The guy found out through her history, which he looked into. Now, whether that's justified is another question. But the key issue here is whether what she did is considered cheating, and whether breaking up over that is the right move.\n\nThe girlfriend argues that since it's the internet, it's not cheating. The guy feels betrayed and can't handle it. Cheating definitions can vary. Some people might consider sharing explicit photos as a form of infidelity, especially if it's done without the partner's consent or if it's against the relationship's boundaries. However, others might see it as consensual if it's between adults and not involving others. But in this case, the guy didn't know about it until he found out, which probably made him feel like she was hiding something.\n\nHe confronted her and she didn't want to stop, leading to the breakup. The question is whether he was wrong to break up. In relationships, communication and mutual boundaries are crucial. If the girlfriend was aware of the guy's possible feelings but continued, that's a problem. On the other hand, the guy might have overreacted, but it's his right to set boundaries. If he felt that her actions violated his trust, then ending the relationship isn't necessarily wrong. However, maybe he could have approached it differently, like discussing it without immediately threatening to end things. But the situation is subjective. The user is asking if he's \"in the wrong,\" which depends on societal norms and perspectives. Some might say he's justified if he felt it was a boundary violation, while others might think it's her right to share content if it's consensual. The answer here would be whether he's in the wrong (A) or not (B). Considering the information, the guy acted based on his feelings of betrayal, and the breakup was his decision based on unresolved conflict. So the answer is B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
