Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she posted on gonewild. First, I need to understand the situation clearly.\n\nSo the guy found out that his girlfriend had a gonewild post, which is a site for explicit content. He found her post by accident while scrolling through Reddit. He clicked on it and realized it was her. Then he confronted her the next day, got into an argument, and ended things because she didn't want to stop posting. His friends are upset, and he's not sure if he did the right thing.\n\nNow, the main question is whether he's at fault. Let's break it down. The key points here are trust, boundaries, and communication. The girlfriend was posting explicit content online, which he found out about. He felt like she was cheating, even though she said it wasn't cheating because it's the internet. The user argues that sharing such content without his consent could be a breach of trust. However, the girlfriend didn't hide it; he stumbled upon it himself. \n\nBut wait, the fact that she was posting explicit photos of herself online might be an issue of personal boundaries. If the guy was uncomfortable with that, then it's his right to express his feelings. However, ending the relationship immediately after an argument might be impulsive. He did confront her and she didn't want to stop, so he decided to end it. \n\nAnother angle is the definition of cheating. Some people might argue that posting explicit content isn't cheating, but others might feel it's a betrayal of trust. The girlfriend's suggestion to do couple posts could have been provocative, but the user's reaction of saying some nasty things and breaking up might have been harsh. \n\nAlso, the user's actions of looking through her history without her knowledge could be problematic. Even if he found the post accidentally, digging into her history might be an invasion of privacy. But in this case, he didn't look through her history intentionally, he just clicked on the post and realized it was her. \n\nThe user's friends are upset, which might indicate that his reaction is seen as extreme. However, relationships involve personal values and what each person is comfortable with. If the user couldn't accept her behavior, then he's not wrong to end things. But if he didn't communicate his boundaries beforehand, maybe he should have had that conversation earlier.\n\nIn conclusion, the user's main wrongdoing, if any, might be not discussing his boundaries about explicit content online before this incident. But once he found out and confronted her, his decision to end the relationship because she refused to stop is his choice. However, the way he handled the confrontation (getting angry and breaking up) might be seen as harsh, but it's still his right to end the relationship. So the answer could be B (No, he's not in the wrong) because he had the right to set boundaries and end the relationship if those boundaries weren't respected. However, the initial invasion of privacy by checking her history could be a point against him. But the main issue is the breaking up, which is his prerogative.\n"
