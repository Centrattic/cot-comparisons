Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author did the wrong thing by breaking up with his girlfriend over her posting on gonewild. First, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author found out his girlfriend was on gonewild, which is a site for adult content. He clicked on her post, realized it was her, and confronted her. She argued that since it's the internet, it's not cheating. The author felt betrayed and ended the relationship because she didn't agree to stop.\n\nNow, considering the perspectives. The author's main issue is about trust and boundaries in the relationship. He felt that her posting explicit content online was equivalent to cheating, even if it's not a physical act. His reaction was emotional, and he decided to end things when she didn't agree to stop. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might see her online activity as personal and not a betrayal. She even suggested making couple posts, which could indicate she didn't think it was a big deal. \n\nSo, in terms of right or wrong, it's subjective. The author's feelings are valid if he felt that her actions violated their relationship's terms. However, some might argue that he overreacted because sharing content online isn't the same as physical infidelity. \n\nBut the key here is mutual consent and boundaries. If they didn't discuss these beforehand, the author has a right to feel wronged. Since he couldn't accept her actions and she wasn't willing to compromise, ending the relationship might be a reasonable choice. Therefore, he's not necessarily in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
