Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after finding out she posted explicit content online. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author found out his girlfriend was posting on a site like Gonewild, which is known for adult content. He was upset and felt like she was cheating, even though she argued that since it's online, it's not cheating. The author felt betrayed, confronted her, and they had a big argument. He ended the relationship because she didn't want to stop the behavior.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. The key points here are consent, boundaries, and mutual understanding in a relationship. The author's perspective is that seeing his girlfriend in explicit content is cheating. The girlfriend, on the other hand, believes that sharing such content online isn't equivalent to cheating. \n\nIn relationships, communication is crucial. The author might not have discussed his boundaries about online activities beforehand. If he didn't set clear expectations about what he considers appropriate or not, the situation could be a result of unspoken boundaries. However, once he found out and felt uncomfortable, it's a valid reason for him to reconsider the relationship if those boundaries aren't respected.\n\nCheating typically involves deceit and betrayal of trust. If the girlfriend shared explicit content without her partner's knowledge, even if it's online, it could be seen as a breach of trust, depending on the couple's agreement. The fact that she suggested he join her for couple posts might have made the author feel even more uncomfortable, reinforcing his decision.\n\nThe author's actions were a response to a violation of trust he perceived. While he could have handled the confrontation more calmly, his decision to end the relationship if she doesn't stop might be justified if he can't reconcile with the situation. It's his right to set boundaries and walk away if those boundaries are crossed.\n\nOn the other hand, if the girlfriend wasn't aware that sharing such content would be an issue, or if the author didn't communicate that, it's a two-way problem. But since the author made his feelings clear and she didn't want to stop, his decision to break up is his way of protecting his comfort and emotional well-being.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. He had the right to make that decision based on his feelings and boundaries. The answer should be B.\n"
