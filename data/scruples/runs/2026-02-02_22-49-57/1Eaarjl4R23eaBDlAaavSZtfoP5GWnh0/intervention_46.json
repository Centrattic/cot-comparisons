Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after finding out she posted on gonewild.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The guy finds his girlfriend's explicit content on gonewild. He confronts her, argues, and breaks up because she doesn't want to stop. The key points here are consent, trust, and mutual understanding in the relationship.\n\nIn relationships, both partners need to agree on boundaries. If the girlfriend was posting explicit content without her partner's knowledge or consent, that's a breach of trust. Even though she might not see it as cheating because it's online, the partner does, and that's a valid feeling. The guy felt violated and decided to end the relationship because of that. \n\nThe girlfriend suggested they do couple posts together, which the guy probably found unacceptable. If they couldn't reach a compromise, the breakup is a result of incompatible values. The guy's actions were based on his feelings of betrayal, which are understandable. He didn't act without reason; he had a valid concern about her actions affecting their relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the girlfriend felt her privacy was invaded when he checked her history. But in a relationship, especially when there's an argument, checking each other's accounts might be a gray area. However, the main issue is her posting explicit content without discussing it with him first. \n\nThe guy's decision to break up is his way of dealing with the breach of trust. Since both couldn't agree on the issue, ending the relationship might be the only option. So, he's not necessarily in the wrong for prioritizing his comfort and boundaries.\n"
