Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is at fault for breaking up with his girlfriend after finding out she posted on gonewild. First, I need to understand the situation thoroughly.\n\nThe main issue here is about trust and boundaries in a relationship. The girlfriend posted explicit content online, and the author found it through a subreddit like Reddit. He confronted her, and she argued that since it was online, it's not cheating. The author felt it was a betrayal and decided to end the relationship because she didn't seem willing to stop the behavior.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. In relationships, both partners have expectations and boundaries. If the girlfriend was aware of the author's discomfort with such content but continued, that's a problem. However, if the author never discussed his feelings beforehand, maybe he's not entirely in the right. \n\nThe key here is communication. If the author didn't address his concerns about her online activity before this incident, he might share some responsibility for not communicating his boundaries. On the flip side, posting explicit content without considering the other partner's feelings can breach trust. \n\nCheating is a big deal, and while the girlfriend might argue it's not cheating, the act of sharing such content without consent can feel like a betrayal. The author's reaction might be valid based on his perspective. However, ending the relationship immediately after a heated argument could be seen as rushed. Maybe he should have given her time to reflect or discussed it more calmly.\n\nBut given that she suggested he join her for couple posts, which implies she didn't take his feelings seriously, the author's decision to end things might be justified. The question is whether his actions were a proportionate response. If the trust was broken and she didn't respect his boundaries, ending the relationship isn't necessarily wrong.\n\nIn summary, the author might not be at fault if he had communicated his boundaries earlier. Since the situation escalated, and the girlfriend didn't respect his feelings, the breakup could be a reasonable choice. However, if communication was lacking on both sides, the author might share some responsibility. But based on the information given, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
