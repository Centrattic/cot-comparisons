Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend after finding her on Gonewild. First, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author found a post on Reddit (specifically Gonewild, which is a sub for explicit content) that was his girlfriend. He was shocked because he didn't realize she was posting such content, and it felt like cheating to him. They had an argument, he said some harsh things, and she didn't want to stop posting, so he broke up. Now he's wondering if he was in the wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are: \n\n1. Did the girlfriend do something wrong by posting on Gonewild? That's a site for explicit content, so sharing personal or explicit photos without consent is unethical and possibly illegal. However, if she consented to post them, it's a different scenario. But sharing intimate content on a public forum like Reddit could be a breach of trust, depending on the relationship expectations.\n\n2. The author felt it was cheating because it was on the internet. Cheating typically involves physical or emotional infidelity, but sharing explicit content can be a gray area. Some people might consider sharing such content without the partner's knowledge as a form of betrayal, even if it's not a direct physical affair. It really depends on the relationship's boundaries and what both parties agreed upon.\n\n3. The breakup decision: The author felt that her actions violated his trust, leading him to end the relationship. If they had an agreement that she wouldn't share such content, then breaking that agreement could justify his decision. However, if there was no prior discussion about this, he might have overreacted. Also, the way he confronted her (being aggressive and then breaking up) might come off as harsh, but if he felt deeply betrayed, it's somewhat understandable.\n\n4. The girlfriend's response: She was defensive, suggesting they do couple posts together. That might indicate she didn't see the issue as serious, which could validate the author's feelings of betrayal. However, her not wanting to stop could mean she didn't consider it a deal-breaker, which might be a difference in values between the two.\n\n5. Ethically, the girlfriend's action of posting explicit content without her partner's knowledge is problematic. Even if it's consensual, sharing it publicly could be a breach of trust. The author's reaction is a personal decision based on how he values that trust. Whether he's in the wrong depends on the context of their relationship and their agreements.\n\nIn many relationships, partners discuss what's acceptable in terms of online behavior. If this was a known boundary and she crossed it, the author is justified. If it wasn't discussed, it's a communication breakdown on both sides. However, given that the content was posted without his knowledge and the emotional impact it had on him, his decision to leave might be seen as a way to protect his emotional well-being. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that he should've communicated his discomfort earlier instead of reacting this way. But in this case, the immediate reaction was triggered by a significant breach of trust. \n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. The girlfriend's actions likely caused the breakup, but the author's decision to end the relationship is a personal choice based on his values. Therefore, the answer would be B (No).\n"
