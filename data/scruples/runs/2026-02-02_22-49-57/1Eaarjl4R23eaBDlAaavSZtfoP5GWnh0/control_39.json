Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she posted on gonewild. First, I need to understand the situation properly.\n\nSo, the girlfriend posted something on gonewild, which is a platform for explicit content. The author found out by accident when he clicked on a post and realized it was her. He confronted her the next day, got into an argument, and decided to break up because she didn't want to stop posting. The question is whether he's at fault.\n\nHmm. Let's break this down. The key points here are consent, boundaries, and mutual understanding in the relationship. The author was upset because he felt like she was cheating, even though she argued that since it's online, it's not cheating. The author's reaction was to end the relationship because she didn't agree to stop posting.\n\nOne aspect to consider is whether the girlfriend was aware of the author's feelings about this. If the author never discussed his boundaries regarding her sharing explicit content online, then maybe he's partly at fault. Relationships require communication. If he never expressed that he found this unacceptable, he can't expect her to know. On the other hand, if they had previous discussions about this and she knew it was a deal-breaker, then maybe her continuing to post is the issue.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's suggestion that he join her for couple posts might indicate a lack of consideration for his feelings. If he was clearly upset, that's not a good sign. However, the author's reaction was to end things immediately without maybe giving her a chance to explain or set clearer boundaries. But in a healthy relationship, both partners should respect each other's boundaries. If she was comfortable with sharing explicit content and he wasn't, that's a fundamental difference. The fact that she didn't want to stop suggests that she values her privacy or her online presence more than his feelings in that area.\n\nAnother angle: cheating. The author felt like she was cheating by posting, but she doesn't see it that way. Cheating usually involves infidelity, but online behavior can be a gray area. However, if sharing explicit content without the partner's consent is a deal-breaker for one partner, then it's a boundary issue, not necessarily cheating. The author might have overreacted, but he's also within his right to end the relationship if this is a deal-breaker.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he didn't communicate his boundaries clearly, then maybe. But if they had a mutual understanding about such things and she broke it, then he's justified. The story doesn't mention prior discussions, so it's possible he didn't set those boundaries. But given that he was upset and ended it, maybe he's not in the wrong if this was a deal-breaker for him. On the other hand, if they had an open relationship or discussed online activities, it's different. But since he's asking AITA, the community might lean towards whether he had a right to be upset. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong) because he ended the relationship due to a fundamental incompatibility. If she was unwilling to respect his boundaries, it's reasonable for him to leave. However, some might argue he should have discussed it first. But given the context, he did confront her and she didn't want to stop. So, B makes sense.\n"
