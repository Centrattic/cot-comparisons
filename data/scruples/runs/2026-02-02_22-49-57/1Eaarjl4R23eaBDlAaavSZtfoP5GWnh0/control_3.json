Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about breaking up with a girlfriend after finding her posts on GoneWild, which is a site associated with adult content. The user is asking if they're the asshole (AITA) for doing so.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author found out that his girlfriend had posted explicit content online, which he discovered through Reddit. He was upset because he felt she was cheating, but she argued that sharing online isn't cheating. He reacted strongly, called her out, and ended the relationship when she didn't agree to stop. Now he's wondering if he was right.\n\nHmm, cheating typically involves physical or emotional infidelity with someone else. However, sharing explicit content can be a boundary issue in a relationship. The girlfriend's stance is that since it's online and not with another person, it's not cheating. But the author felt betrayed and ended it. \n\nI should consider what the girlfriend's actions were. If she shared explicit photos of herself, even without another person, it's possible that this violates the trust the author had in the relationship. Different people have different boundaries. The fact that she suggested he join her for couple posts is concerning. Maybe she didn't see the issue, or maybe she thought it was consensual but not her fault. \n\nThe author's reaction might be seen as justified because he felt it was a breach of trust. However, some might argue that as long as she wasn't cheating with someone else, ending the relationship over this is harsh. But others might say that sharing explicit content without consent (even if it's with oneself) can still be a betrayal of trust. \n\nAlso, the way he handled it\u2014confronting her, getting aggressive, then breaking up\u2014could affect the perception. If he was abusive in his communication, that's another issue. But the user mentioned he said some nasty things, which might have been part of the conflict. However, the main issue is whether her actions were wrong in his eyes, leading to the breakup.\n\nIn many relationships, sharing explicit content without discussing it first is a big deal. The girlfriend not wanting to stop suggests she didn't see it as a problem, which might mean the author's decision to end things is a matter of incompatible values. So, the author might not be in the wrong here because he's standing by his boundaries. But if the content was shared consensually and without another person involved, maybe the author overreacted. \n\nI think the key is whether the act of posting the content is considered cheating by the author. Since she didn't agree to stop, he chose to end the relationship. Different people have different views on this. Legally, sharing explicit content without consent can be an issue, but in a relationship, it's more about mutual agreement. If they hadn't discussed this beforehand, the author has a right to be upset. So, depending on perspectives, the author might not be in the wrong. Answer B (No).\n"
