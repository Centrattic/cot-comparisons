Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for breaking up with his girlfriend because she posted on a site called gonewild. First, I need to understand the situation.\n\nSo, the girlfriend posted something on gonewild, which the author found out. The key points here are: the author found a post of his girlfriend on an adult site, which he considers cheating. They argued, and he broke up with her because she didn't want to stop posting. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Let's break it down. Cheating usually refers to physical or emotional infidelity. But here, she's posting on a site that might be considered inappropriate for a relationship. However, the girlfriend argues that since it's on the internet, it's not cheating. The author feels betrayed because he didn't know about her posts and found out this way. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the definition of cheating. In many relationships, cheating involves a breach of trust, which can include online activities if both partners have agreed that such activities are off-limits. However, if the girlfriend didn't explicitly agree beforehand that posting on such sites would be considered cheating, then the author's reaction might be seen as his own misunderstanding of the boundaries.\n\nAlso, communication is key in relationships. If the author had discussed his expectations with his girlfriend before this incident, maybe they could have reached a mutual understanding. Instead, he discovered it through her posts without prior discussion. The girlfriend says it's not cheating, and the author is upset. \n\nBut then, the author's reaction led to a breakup. Is that fair? If the girlfriend's actions are within their agreed-upon boundaries, then the author's reaction might be his own issue. However, if the author felt that such online activities were a deal-breaker, then choosing to end the relationship because of that is his right. \n\nAnother angle: the girlfriend suggested doing couple posts, which the author found unacceptable. If she continued to engage in activities that he found objectionable after the discussion, then the breakup might be justified from his perspective. But if the issue was a matter of differing values or red flags he didn't consider before, it's his own responsibility to realize compatibility.\n\nSo, the author's fault could be not communicating his boundaries before the incident. If he never discussed this with her, then he can't expect her to know. On the other hand, if she didn't respect his feelings after the argument, then he's justified in ending things. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's more about personal boundaries and communication. If the author didn't set those boundaries in the relationship earlier, he might be partially at fault. However, since he did react to her actions and she didn't want to stop, he's not entirely in the wrong for breaking up. It's a bit of a gray area, but the question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nThe answer might lean towards B (No), because the author is making a choice based on his comfort and trust, which is his prerogative. However, if he didn't communicate expectations beforehand, maybe there's a case for A. But since the breakup happened after a discussion where she didn't agree to stop, he's within his rights to end the relationship.\n"
