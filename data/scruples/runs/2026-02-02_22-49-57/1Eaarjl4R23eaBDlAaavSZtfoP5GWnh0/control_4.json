Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy broke up with his girlfriend because she posted something on Gonewild, which is a site for explicit content. The key points here are about trust, communication, and what constitutes cheating.\n\nFirst, the author found out that his girlfriend was posting explicit content on a site. He was upset because he felt she was cheating, even though she argued that since it was online, it wasn't cheating. The guy's reaction was to end the relationship because she didn't want to stop posting, and he felt violated.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's consider both sides. From his perspective, seeing explicit content of his girlfriend online might make him feel betrayed. Even if it's consensual and not with someone else, sharing such content without his consent could be a breach of trust. Especially if they had an agreement not to do so. If they had no prior discussion about this, then his reaction might be justified based on his feelings of betrayal.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might argue that she didn't break any explicit rules and that she believed sharing content online wasn't the same as cheating. But in many relationships, sharing explicit material without the partner's consent is considered a violation of trust. It's possible she didn't think it was a big deal, but the fact that the author felt this way is important. The fact that she suggested he join her for couple posts might come off as dismissive of his feelings, which could escalate the situation.\n\nThe author did confront her, gave her a chance to stop, and when she didn't, he ended the relationship. While his method of communication might have been harsh (saying \"nasty things\"), his decision to end it because of a lack of mutual respect or compromise might be seen as his right. The real issue here is about boundaries and whether both parties respected each other's feelings. If the girlfriend was unaware that sharing such content was a deal-break for him, but he hadn't communicated that clearly, maybe there's room for both sides. However, once he expressed his feelings and she didn't comply, ending the relationship because of incompatible values seems reasonable.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because breaking up over a breach of trust that wasn't consensual and where the partner refused to respect his boundaries is understandable.\n"
