Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he found out his girlfriend was posting on gonewild, which is a site that shares explicit content. He broke up with her because he felt like she was cheating or at least being dishonest. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The girlfriend was posting on gonewild. Now, whether that's cheating depends on their agreement. If they had no prior discussion about this, then maybe it's a big deal for him. But the girlfriend says that since it's the internet, it's not cheating. That's a common argument, but some people might feel differently.\n\nHe says he confronted her, got angry, and ended the relationship because she didn't want to stop. She even suggested he join her for couple posts. That's pretty intense. The question is whether he was right to break up. \n\nFrom his perspective, finding out she's sharing explicit content without him knowing could be a breach of trust. Even if it's \"just the internet,\" sharing such content can be a major red flag. He felt it was a deal-breaker, so acting on that isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nBut then, maybe he overreacted? Did he give her a chance to explain? He said he looked through her history and found she had multiple posts. If she had a history of this and he was unaware, maybe he should have talked to her first before breaking up. However, he did confront her, and she didn't want to stop. So maybe it was a mutual decision once he realized they had different values. \n\nThe key points here are mutual respect and consent. If he felt uncomfortable and she refused to stop, then ending the relationship might be justified. Also, if she was sharing explicit content without his knowledge, that's a violation of trust. \n\nBut wait, she might have posted before they were in a relationship. If that's the case, maybe it's not his issue. However, the story doesn't mention that. He found out she was posting after they were already in a relationship. So he had a right to feel hurt and betrayed. \n\nIn summary, if the girlfriend was sharing explicit content without his knowledge and he felt it was a deal-breaker, then he's not in the wrong for breaking up. However, some might argue that she wasn't cheating and he overreacted. But given the circumstances, his actions seem justified in seeking a breakup over a breach of trust.\n"
