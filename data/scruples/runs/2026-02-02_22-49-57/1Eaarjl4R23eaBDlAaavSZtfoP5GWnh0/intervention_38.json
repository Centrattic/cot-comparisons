Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her posting on gonewild is in the wrong. The question is whether the author is at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation clearly. The girlfriend posted a \"gonewild\" post, which is a subreddit for explicit content. The author found out she was there, and after an argument, he broke up because she didn't want to stop. She argued that online activity isn't cheating, but he felt it was. \n\nSo, the key points here are: the girlfriend's online behavior, the author's reaction, and the definition of cheating. The author felt betrayed and ended the relationship because she didn't respect his boundaries. The girlfriend thought it wasn't cheating. \n\nNow, considering societal norms and relationship ethics, cheating typically involves physical infidelity. However, some people might include emotional infidelity or sharing explicit content online as a boundary violation. The author's discomfort is valid if he views this as cheating, even if she doesn't. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, he's acting based on his own boundaries. If he communicated his expectations beforehand, then breaking up because she crossed that line isn't unreasonable. However, if he didn't discuss this before, maybe he should have considered that. But in the scenario, it's implied that the issue arose when he found out, so maybe prior communication wasn't there. \n\nBut the main question is whether ending the relationship makes him at fault. Since relationships are about mutual respect for boundaries, if she didn't respect his boundaries (if he had any), he has the right to end it. She also has her own views on what's acceptable. So, it's a conflict of expectations. \n\nHe didn't confront her aggressively initially. He waited till morning, tried to talk, then made a decision when she didn't agree to stop. His actions were based on his feelings of betrayal. Since people can have different views on what constitutes cheating, it's hard to say he's in the wrong. He's prioritizing his own comfort and values. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's making a choice based on his boundaries, and relationships require both parties to agree on such terms. If they can't, parting ways is reasonable.\n"
