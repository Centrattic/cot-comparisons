Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation involves a breakup after the author found out his girlfriend was posting on Gonewild, a site with explicit content. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author clicked on a Gonewild post and realized it was his girlfriend. He confronted her, and she argued that since it was online, it's not cheating. He felt she was being dishonest and decided to break up when she didn't want to stop posting. The question is whether he was wrong to do so.\n\nHmm. So, from the author's perspective, he was hurt and felt betrayed by her posting explicit content online. Even if she wasn't cheating in a traditional sense, sharing such content might be a violation of trust. The girlfriend's argument that it's not cheating because it's online is a key point here. But does that make the author wrong for ending the relationship?\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author overreacted. Cheating typically involves physical infidelity, but sharing content could be a different issue. However, the definition of cheating can vary between couples. If they didn't have an agreement about such content, the girlfriend might not have realized how much it would hurt him. The author's reaction is based on his feelings of betrayal and lack of trust.\n\nBut the author's actions included confronting her in an aggressive manner and then breaking up. He admits he said some nasty things. So, while his feelings are valid, maybe he could have handled it differently. However, the core issue is the girlfriend's actions. If she was okay with continuing, then the breakup might be justified if he couldn't accept that.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. If the user is asking if he's at fault, it's about whether his actions were justified. Since he ended the relationship because she didn't stop something that caused him emotional distress, but it wasn't a direct betrayal (cheating), some might argue he's overreacting, while others might say it's his right to leave if he can't handle it.\n\nI think the answer hinges on mutual respect and communication. If they didn't discuss boundaries beforehand, both could be at fault. But since the girlfriend didn't want to stop, and the author felt he couldn't continue, then the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for leaving. So the answer is B (No).\n"
