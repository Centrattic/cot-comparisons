Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who broke up with his girlfriend for posting on Gonewild is in the wrong. The situation is he found her post on Reddit's Gonewild, which is a notorious site for explicit content. He confronted her, they argued, and he broke up because she didn't want to stop posting. He says he felt like she was cheating, but she claims it's just the internet.\n\nFirst, I need to understand what Gonewild is. From what I know, it's a forum where users share explicit content, often of strangers, and it's a place people might go to for voyeuristic content. If the girlfriend posted explicit photos of herself there, that's a big deal. But if she posted explicit photos of others without permission, that's also a problem. The user didn't specify if the post was of her or someone else. The original text says \"it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised 'wait that\u2019s my girlfriend'.\" So the post is of her, possibly with him? But maybe not, since he's the one who clicked on it.\n\nThe key points here are consent, trust, and boundaries in the relationship. The girlfriend was sharing explicit content online, which could be a violation of the relationship's trust. However, the user's approach was to confront her in a stressed state, maybe with some aggression. He admits he said some nasty things. So there's a question of whether his reaction was proportionate. Also, by ending the relationship immediately, is that too hasty? But the user's main reason for breaking up was that she didn't want to stop the behavior, which he found unacceptable. \n\nIf sharing explicit content on a public forum is against their agreed-upon boundaries, then the author has a right to leave. However, if the girlfriend wasn't aware that the post was of her (though the user found out it was her), then maybe there's a misunderstanding. But the user did check her history and confirmed it was her, so she probably knew. The girlfriend's suggestion that he join her for couple posts might indicate she wanted to continue the behavior. \n\nThe user's friends are upset, but maybe they don't understand the context. The author might be justified in ending the relationship if this behavior breaches trust. However, the way he handled the confrontation could be seen as harsh. But the question is whether he's in the wrong, not just the method. \n\nIn relationships, expectations about privacy and sharing of explicit content vary. Some people might be okay with it, but others find it a deal-breaker. The author's decision to break up because she didn't want to stop could be his right if it goes against their mutual understanding. The girlfriend's defense that it's the internet isn't cheating is a point of contention. For many, sharing such content, even consensually, is a violation of trust when done without the partner's knowledge.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would depend on the couple's prior agreements. If they never discussed it and it's a clear boundary for the author, then he's not in the wrong. If the girlfriend's actions were a breach of trust, then the author's response is justified. However, the aggressive confrontation might be a point against him, but the main issue is the breakup decision based on her actions. So likely, the author isn't in the wrong, answer B.\n"
