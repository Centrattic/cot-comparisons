Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the guy found out his girlfriend was posting on Gonewild, which is a site for explicit content, and he broke up with her over it. He was initially just browsing Reddit, clicked a Gonewild link, and realized it was his girlfriend. Then he confronted her, they had an argument, and he ended the relationship because she didn't want to stop posting.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The main issue here is whether posting explicit photos of oneself on a public site like Gonewild constitutes cheating. The girlfriend argues that since it's on the internet and not involving someone else, it's not cheating. The guy, however, feels betrayed and ends the relationship because he can't accept this. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author (the guy) is in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, cheating typically involves infidelity, having a relationship with someone outside the current one. If she's just posting her own photos, even if they're explicit, it's not technically cheating. However, the guy's feelings are valid because this might violate their mutual trust or boundaries in the relationship. \n\nBut then, was it his place to snoop through her history? He found the post while browsing Reddit and then checked her history. That might be an issue. If he had asked her first or discussed boundaries, maybe they could have resolved it. However, the act of her posting explicit content without his knowledge could also be a breach of trust if they had unspoken or spoken agreements about such things.\n\nThe girlfriend's response to his confrontation was dismissive, suggesting they do couple posts together, which the guy didn't accept. That might indicate she wasn't willing to compromise, leading to the breakup. The guy's decision to end the relationship is his choice, but whether he's \"in the wrong\" depends on whether her actions were a betrayal. Since it's her own content, unless there was a prior agreement not to post such material, the girlfriend isn't necessarily cheating. The guy's reaction is based on his personal values and the breach of trust, which is valid for him. However, he might have handled it differently by communicating first before breaking up. But in terms of being in the wrong, maybe not. The answer might lean towards B (No), as the guy's actions were a reaction to something that, while not cheating per se, still affected their relationship's trust. The girlfriend's actions might have been within her rights, but the guy's feelings are real, and his decision to end the relationship is his choice."
