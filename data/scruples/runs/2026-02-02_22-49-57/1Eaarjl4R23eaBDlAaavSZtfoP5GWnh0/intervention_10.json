Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who broke up with his girlfriend for posting on GoneWild is in the wrong. The story is from an AITA (Am I the Asshole) context, so I need to analyze the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the key points: The guy found out his girlfriend had posted explicit content on GoneWild, which he discovered by accident while browsing Reddit. He confronted her, there was an argument, and he broke up because she didn't want to stop. He's wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nSo, the question is about whether his actions were justified. Let's break it down.\n\n1. **Consent and Privacy**: The girlfriend posted her own explicit content online. While it's her choice to do so, the boyfriend found out through her account. The issue here is whether he had the right to look through her history without her consent. If he accessed her private accounts without permission, that could be a privacy violation. However, in this case, he found her post on Reddit, which might be public if she posted it there. But maybe the history refers to her browsing history on his device? Wait, the text says he looked through \"her history\". Wait, the user says they were both using Reddit, and he clicked on a post and realized it was his girlfriend. How did he get her history? Did he check her phone or browser history? If he was on his own device and saw the post, maybe he's not looking through her history. Wait, the original text says: \"looked through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.\" So he looked at her browsing history or some other history on his device? If they were on the same device, but she had posted it, maybe he was using her account? Or maybe he was on his own device and found a post she made. The exact circumstances of how he found her history matter. If he accessed her private browser history without her permission, that's a privacy violation. But if the post was public, then he found it in a public space.\n\n2. **Cheating Definition**: The girlfriend argues that posting online isn't cheating. The boyfriend felt like she was cheating because she was posting explicit content, even if it's not with someone else. This is a matter of personal boundaries. In a relationship, both parties should agree on what's acceptable. If the boyfriend felt uncomfortable, it's valid for him to address it. However, if she didn't share her content with him and he discovered it without her knowledge, that could be a breach of trust.\n\n3. **Communication and Reaction**: The boyfriend confronted her, but he got angry (\"aggy\") and said some nasty things. That's not ideal communication. The girlfriend suggested they do couple posts, which could be a red flag if he wasn't comfortable with that. The breakup was his choice because he felt her actions were a dealbreaker. If the relationship had issues with communication and trust, the breakup might be seen as a result of underlying problems rather than just her posting.\n\n4. **Boundaries in Relationships**: The main issue here is the difference in what each person considers appropriate. The boyfriend's reaction is based on his personal boundaries, which can be valid. However, the way he handled it (confronting her after secretly looking through her history) could be problematic. If he accessed her private information without consent, that's a violation of trust, which might make him the asshole for breaking up over something he shouldn't have seen in the first place.\n\n5. **Public vs. Private Content**: If the content was on a public platform like Reddit's GoneWild, and she wasn't hiding it, maybe he shouldn't have looked. But if he found it by accident and then proceeded to check her history without her knowing, that's where the line is crossed. The key is whether he had the right to access her private data.\n\nPutting it all together: If the boyfriend accessed her private information without consent, that's a breach of trust, and his reaction could be seen as retaliatory. However, if the content was public and he found it by chance, then his discomfort is valid, and his breakup is his choice. The problem is the method he used to discover the content. If he snooped through her history, that's an issue. The girlfriend's suggestion to do couple posts might have escalated the problem, but the initial action of the boyfriend to check her history without her consent is a key point.\n\nSo, depending on whether he accessed her private data, the answer could vary. Since the text says he looked through her history, which might imply he was checking her browsing history or account, that's a privacy violation. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for snooping, even if her content was a dealbreaker for him. However, if he found it publicly, then it's different. But given the ambiguity, the act of confronting her after secretly looking could make him the asshole.\n"
