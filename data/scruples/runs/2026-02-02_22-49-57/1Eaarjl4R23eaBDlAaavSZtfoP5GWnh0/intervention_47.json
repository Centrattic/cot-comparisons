Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking if the person who broke up with his girlfriend over her posting on Gonewild is in the wrong. The scenario is that he found her posts on a site typically associated with explicit content, which shocked him. They argued, and he ended things because she didn't agree that it was cheating and even suggested they do it together.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The key points are his reaction and her stance. He felt betrayed because she was on a site he associates with cheating, even if it's not explicit. She argued that since it's the internet, it's not cheating. He then ended the relationship because she didn't want to stop.\n\nNow, the question is whether he did the right thing. Some might argue that posting on Gonewild isn't the same as cheating, especially if there's no actual infidelity. However, in relationships, trust and boundaries are crucial. If her actions made him uncomfortable and he communicated that, and she didn't respect his feelings, then ending the relationship might be justified. \n\nBut on the other hand, maybe he overreacted. Some people might say that using a site like that could be part of a consensual dynamic, and if she was open about it, it's her choice. However, the fact that she didn't stop and even suggested he join could indicate that she didn't take his comfort seriously. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong. I need to balance both sides. The key here is whether her actions were a deal-breaker for him. Since he felt betrayed and she didn't respect his feelings, ending the relationship seems reasonable. Therefore, he's not in the wrong.\n"
