Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author (the person who broke up with his girlfriend) is in the wrong. The situation is that he found out his girlfriend was posting on gonewild, which he saw as cheating. The main point here is whether posting explicit content online counts as cheating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. The author felt betrayed because he saw her posts on a platform that's typically for explicit content. He confronted her, and she argued that since it's the internet, it's not cheating. He then broke up with her because she didn't agree to stop. \n\nNow, the key factors here are consent and mutual understanding in the relationship. Cheating usually involves a breach of trust and fidelity. If the couple had an agreement that she wouldn't post such content, then she breaking that agreement would be cheating. However, if there was no prior discussion about this, the situation is a bit more complex. \n\nThe girlfriend's argument is that it's not cheating because it's online. But in many relationships, especially monogamous ones, sharing explicit content with others (even anonymously) can be considered a breach of trust. It's about how each person perceives boundaries. The author clearly felt it was cheating, so his reaction is based on his values and the trust in the relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might see her actions as her personal choice, not involving any physical or emotional infidelity. However, the act of sharing explicit material with the public, even on a private platform, can be seen as violating the exclusivity expected in a committed relationship. \n\nThe author's decision to break up is a personal choice based on his feelings of betrayal. While he might have handled the confrontation poorly (getting aggressive and saying nasty things), the core issue is whether her actions were a deal-breaker. Since he couldn't accept her stance, ending the relationship is his right. \n\nBut was he in the wrong? It depends on whether there were prior expectations. If there was no prior discussion, both might have different views. However, the fact that he was upset and felt it was cheating suggests that he had expectations she didn't meet. In that case, the author isn't necessarily wrong for breaking up, especially if he felt the trust was broken. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because his decision was based on his perception of betrayal and the trust issues it created in the relationship. The girlfriend's actions might not be cheating in her eyes, but in his, they were, leading him to end the relationship which is a valid choice.\n"
