Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who broke up with his girlfriend for posting on Gonewild is in the wrong. The question is whether he did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The guy found out his girlfriend was posting explicit content online, specifically on Gonewild, which is a site for adult content. He felt betrayed, thought she was cheating because she was sharing personal stuff publicly. They had an argument, and he ended the relationship because she didn't want to stop doing it, and he couldn't handle it.\n\nNow, considering cheating. If the girlfriend was posting her own content, that's different from cheating. Cheating usually involves engaging in sexual activities with someone else. So, if she's just posting her own content, even if it's explicit, that's not technically cheating. But the guy perceived it as a breach of trust. However, she argues that since it's the internet, it's not cheating. That's a key point. \n\nThe guy's reaction was to end the relationship because he couldn't accept her behavior. Is that fair? Well, trust and boundaries in a relationship are subjective. What one person finds okay, another might not. The girlfriend might not see her actions as wrong, but the guy does. So, the question is whether he overreacted.\n\nIf they had mutual agreements about privacy and she violated it, then maybe he's justified. But if they never discussed such boundaries, then it's more complicated. The article mentions they argued about it, and she didn't want to stop. The guy felt it was a deal-breaker. \n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's boundaries is crucial. If she didn't set that as a boundary, maybe she was unaware of how it affects him. But he could have tried to talk it through more, instead of ending it immediately after an argument where he said some harsh things. However, if that behavior was a deal-breaker for him, ending the relationship because of irreconcilable differences isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? It depends on the circumstances. If they hadn't discussed boundaries beforehand, he could be in the right to end the relationship if he can't accept her choices. But if he ended it without proper communication or understanding her perspective, maybe there's some fault. However, given that she didn't want to stop and he couldn't handle it, his decision might be justified. Therefore, the answer is B (No, he's not in the wrong).\n"
