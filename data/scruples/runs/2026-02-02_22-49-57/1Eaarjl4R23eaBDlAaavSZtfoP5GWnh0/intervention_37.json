Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who broke up with his girlfriend for posting on GoneWild is in the wrong. The scenario is that the guy found her posts online, which he considered cheating, and he ended the relationship because she didn't want to stop. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants another opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend posted explicit content online, which the boyfriend found. He felt it was cheating, even though she argued that it wasn't because it's the internet. The argument escalated, and he ended the relationship when she refused to stop. \n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The concept of cheating varies between relationships. Some people might not see online activities as cheating unless there's an explicit agreement. The girl's perspective is that sharing online isn't the same as physical infidelity, which is a common debate. However, the guy felt violated and decided to end the relationship. \n\nThe user's stance is that the author isn't wrong because the girlfriend didn't respect his boundaries. But others might argue that the guy overreacted because posting online isn't traditionally considered cheating. However, personal boundaries are important in relationships. If the girlfriend was aware of his discomfort and continued, that might tip the scale towards her being in the wrong. \n\nAnother angle is communication. The guy confronted her, but the argument was heated. He might have handled it better, but the decision to end things when she refused to stop could be seen as his right. The girl suggesting couple posts might have been a red flag he was trying to avoid. \n\nIn conclusion, while there's a valid debate about what constitutes cheating, the author's decision to prioritize his comfort and set boundaries isn't inherently wrong. The girlfriend's actions disregarded his feelings, so the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
