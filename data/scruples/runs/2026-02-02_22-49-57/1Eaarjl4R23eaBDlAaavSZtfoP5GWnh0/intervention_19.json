Recently though she and I got into an argument about this, and now I\u2019m just not sure if I did the right thing. \n\nI was knackered after a night out so I do what I usually do after a night out. Lay in my bed and scroll through reddit till i realise I should sleep. So I\u2019m scrolling and I\u2019m not sure if this is just me, but when I see a porn post or an NSFW post in general I click it. So I just see a gonewild post and think \u201coh cool\u201d and click on it. Still reeling from \u00a31 night at the club I didn\u2019t immediately notice it was my girlfriend, but something was familiar about the post. The bed looked familiar, so did the overall room, but then I saw her body realised \u201cwait that\u2019s my girlfriend\u201d. I was mostly in shock and just started looking through her history and what I saw confirmed that it was 100% her.  Just filled with a mixed ball of emotion I decided I should sleep, but I couldn\u2019t. \n\nSo I waited till the morning my mind going mad. Eventually I texted her confronting her about it. I got a bit aggy saying how I felt like she was cheating on me and she was saying to me that since it was the internet it wasn\u2019t cheating. In all honesty I said some nasty things and I could tell she wasn\u2019t having a good time either. Said to her that I would like her to stop posting, and if she doesn\u2019t then I didn\u2019t really want to continue things with her. She started saying loads of stuff even suggesting I join her for couple posts? In the end I realised she didn\u2019t want to stop so I ended things then and there. Haven\u2019t messaged her since and my mates are aggy at me asking what was going on. I\u2019m not going to expose her, but this is a bit much for me right now. \n\nAITA\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who broke up with his girlfriend for her posting on gonewild is in the wrong. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The guy found out his girlfriend was posting explicit content online, specifically on gonewild, which he discovered through Reddit. He confronted her, and she didn't think it was cheating because it's the internet. He felt betrayed and ended the relationship. He's asking if he's at fault.\n\nSo, the key points here: The girlfriend was sharing explicit material online. The boyfriend saw it accidentally, felt cheated on, and broke up. She didn't think posting online was cheating. \n\nNow, considering cheating definitions. Traditionally, cheating involves a physical or emotional affair. But in modern relationships, boundaries can vary. Some people might consider online activities, like sharing explicit photos, as a breach of trust, especially if it's done without the partner's knowledge. However, the girlfriend argues that because it's online, it's not cheating. \n\nThe boyfriend discovered this, confronted her, and she suggested he join her in posting as a couple. That might be a red flag for him. He felt it was too much and ended the relationship. \n\nMoral perspectives vary. If both partners had agreed on boundaries regarding online content, then maybe one side is wrong. But in this case, there's no mention of prior discussion. The boyfriend had no idea she was doing this, which led to betrayal. \n\nBut is he in the wrong for breaking up? If he felt it violated trust, then ending the relationship isn't necessarily wrong. However, if she didn't consider it cheating, maybe he overreacted. But given the emotional impact and the breach of trust, his decision could be justified. \n\nThe user says they think the author isn't in the wrong. The question is whether the answer is A or B. Given the situation, it's more likely B (not in the wrong) because he acted based on his feelings of betrayal and lack of trust, which are valid even if the other person didn't see it the same way.\n"
