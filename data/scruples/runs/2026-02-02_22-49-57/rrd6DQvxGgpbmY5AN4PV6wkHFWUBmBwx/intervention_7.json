The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA story is in the wrong. The situation is about using the word \"obviously\" when discussing a psychology experiment with his girlfriend.\n\nThe author says he didn't mean to be snarky, just stated the conclusion was obvious. The girlfriend felt offended because using \"obviously\" made her feel dumb. She's a psych major, so he assumed she would know it was obvious. But she argues that when she first learned it, it wasn't obvious, and his comment hurt her feelings.\n\nThe author doesn't think he's in the wrong and even says he needs her to not get offended over little things. The user thinks the author isn't wrong but wants to know if I agree. \n\nHmm. So the key points here are about communication and empathy. The word \"obviously\" can come off as dismissive, even if not intended that way. The girlfriend's feelings were hurt, and the author's response was to not care about her feelings in this context. That seems dismissive of her feelings, which is a red flag. \n\nEven if the conclusion was obvious to the author, the girlfriend's experience of learning it and not finding it obvious is valid. The author's assumption that she should have known it was obvious might be where the problem lies. Using \"obviously\" can be a microaggression, making others feel their understanding is being questioned. \n\nThe author's reaction of not apologizing and telling her to not get offended is problematic. It's important to acknowledge others' feelings even if you don't see the issue. The author didn't validate her feelings, which is part of the problem. \n\nSo, even if the author didn't mean harm, the impact is what matters. The response to her feelings by dismissing them makes him at fault. Therefore, the answer is A (author is in the wrong).\n"
