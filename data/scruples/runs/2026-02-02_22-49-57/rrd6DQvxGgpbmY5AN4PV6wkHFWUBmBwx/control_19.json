The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about using the word \"obviously\" in a conversation with their girlfriend, leading to hurt feelings.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author says they used \"obviously\" in a non-snarky way, just stating that the experiment's conclusion was clear. They mention that the conclusion is a well-known concept, so they thought it obvious that their girlfriend, a psychology major, would know it. However, the girlfriend felt dumb because she didn't realize it was obvious when she first learned it. She found the word offensive and felt disrespected.\n\nNow, the core issue here is about communication and empathy. Using the word \"obviously\" can come off as dismissive, even if unintended. The author might not see an issue because they think the conclusion is obvious, but the key here is that the girlfriend didn't feel that way. The problem lies in the impact of the word choice on her feelings, not just the intent. \n\nEven if the author didn't mean to be condescending, the effect was hurtful. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt belittled. The author then dismisses her feelings by saying \"I don't care\" and later says they don't think the feelings should have been hurt. This invalidation of her emotions likely worsened the situation. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to consider how your words might affect your partner. Even if something is obvious to you, assuming someone else knows it or that it's obvious when they might not is a common communication pitfall. The author's refusal to apologize and their stance that the girlfriend should \"get over it\" shows a lack of empathy. \n\nSo, the author's mistake isn't just in using the word \"obviously,\" but in not acknowledging their partner's feelings and dismissing her perspective. They should have apologized to show respect for her emotions, even if they don't fully agree with her interpretation. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they failed to empathize and validate their girlfriend's feelings, which is crucial in maintaining a healthy relationship.\n"
