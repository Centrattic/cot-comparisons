The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for hurting their girlfriend's feelings by using the word \"obviously\" during a discussion about a psychology experiment. The situation is that the author thought the conclusion was obvious, so they said so, and the girlfriend felt that was offensive. The author is trying to figure out if they're at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The girlfriend is a psych major, so the author assumes she should know the conclusion. But maybe just because it's a well-known concept doesn't mean everyone finds it obvious when they first learn it. The author used the word \"obviously,\" which is often used in a way that belittles others' lack of knowledge. Even if the author didn't mean it snarkily, saying something is obvious can come off as dismissive. The girlfriend felt stupid and hurt, which is a valid emotional response. The author then downplays her feelings by saying \"I don't care\" and later arguing that she shouldn't get worked up over little things. That's problematic because it invalidates her emotions instead of acknowledging them. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to respect each other's feelings. Even if the author sees the situation as minor, the girlfriend's reaction is real and significant to her. The fact that she had to learn the concept in her class and the author's comment made her feel that her experience wasn't valued suggests that the author's approach was hurtful. The author's refusal to apologize despite the girlfriend's hurt feelings shows a lack of empathy. \n\nSo, even if the conclusion was indeed obvious to the author, the way they communicated it and their subsequent dismissal of her feelings make them at fault. The answer should be A, the author is in the wrong because using \"obviously\" can be condescending and their invalidation of her emotions exacerbated the situation.\n"
