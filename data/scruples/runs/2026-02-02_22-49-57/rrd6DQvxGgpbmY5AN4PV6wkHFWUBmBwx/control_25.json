The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author using the word \"obviously\" when discussing a psychology experiment with his girlfriend. The girlfriend felt hurt because she didn't find it obvious when she first learned about it, and the author dismissed her feelings by saying he didn't care that she was offended.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points here. The author used \"obviously,\" which is a common phrase that can come off as dismissive. The girlfriend, a psych major, was sharing something she found cool, but the author's response made her feel dumb. Even though the conclusion might be obvious to the author, the girlfriend's experience of learning it wasn't obvious to her at the time. \n\nThe author's main argument is that the conclusion is indeed obvious and that as a psych major, she should have known. But that's a flawed assumption because everyone's prior knowledge and experience with the topic can differ. The fact that she found it interesting initially suggests it wasn't obvious to her when she learned it. \n\nThen, when the girlfriend tried to explain why \"obviously\" was hurtful, the author responded with \"I don't care\" and dismissed her feelings. This is a problem because invalidating someone's feelings, even if you disagree with their perspective, is not healthy in a relationship. The author's insistence that it's not a big deal and that the girlfriend should \"get over it\" shows a lack of empathy and understanding.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key factors here are: 1) using a phrase that can be hurtful without realizing it, 2) dismissing the girlfriend's feelings when she explains why she was hurt, and 3) refusing to apologize despite acknowledging that he might have hurt her feelings. \n\nIn most relationship dynamics, being dismissive and not validating a partner's emotions can lead to deeper issues. The author might not have intended to be hurtful, but the impact on the girlfriend's feelings is real. The author's response of \"I don't care that you're offended\" is particularly problematic because it shows a lack of consideration for her perspective. \n\nEven if the author believes the word \"obviously\" wasn't meant to be offensive in that context, the fact that it made her feel stupid means it was inappropriate. The author's refusal to apologize and his attitude towards her getting \"worked up\" about it suggest he's not taking her feelings seriously enough. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions\u2014using a potentially hurtful phrase and then invalidating her feelings\u2014do place him in the wrong. The right choice here is A: Yes, the author is in the wrong.\n"
