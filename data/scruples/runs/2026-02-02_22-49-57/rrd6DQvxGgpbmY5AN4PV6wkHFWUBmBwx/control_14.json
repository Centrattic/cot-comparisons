The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong. Let me read through the details carefully.\n\nThe situation is that the author said an experiment's conclusion was \"obvious\" to their girlfriend, who is a psych major. She took offense because the word \"obviously\" made her feel dumb. The author argues that it was obvious and that as a psych major, his girlfriend should've known that. He's refusing to apologize, saying he doesn't think her feelings should be hurt.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the use of the word \"obviously.\" Even if the author thought it was obvious, using that term can come off as dismissive. People often use \"obviously\" to belittle others' lack of understanding, even if that's not the intention. The girlfriend felt hurt, and the author is dismissing her feelings by saying it's a small thing. \n\nThe author's response is crucial. The girlfriend tried to explain why it was offensive, but he responded with \"I don't care\" and said he doesn't think her feelings should be hurt. That's invalidating her emotions. Even if he didn't mean to be snarky, the impact is what matters here. Relationships require empathy and considering the other person's perspective, not just your own logic.\n\nThe author also mentions that he doesn't see it as a big deal and that he needs her to not get offended over little things. This attitude suggests he's not taking her feelings seriously. In healthy relationships, both partners should validate each other's emotions, even if they don't fully understand the cause. The fact that he's refusing to apologize and is instead trying to justify his actions shows a lack of willingness to address her hurt feelings, which is a problem.\n\nSo, even if the author didn't intend to be offensive, the word choice did hurt her, and his response was dismissive. Therefore, he's in the wrong for not acknowledging her feelings and being defensive instead of empathetic.\n"
