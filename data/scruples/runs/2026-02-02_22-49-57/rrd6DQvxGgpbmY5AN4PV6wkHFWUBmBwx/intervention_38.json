The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. The situation is that he used the word \"obviously\" when talking about a psychology experiment to his girlfriend. She got hurt because it made her feel dumb, even though he didn't mean to be snarky. He thinks he's not wrong because the conclusion was obvious, and as a psych major, she should have known it. He's not apologizing and thinks it's a small thing.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the perspective of the girlfriend. She's a psych major and felt that using \"obviously\" was dismissive. Even if the conclusion was obvious to him, she might have felt that he was belittling her experience when she first learned it. The word \"obviously\" can be seen as condescending, even if spoken neutrally. People can interpret it as implying that the other person should have known it already, which is hurtful.\n\nThe author argues that he didn't use it in a snarky way and that he's sorry but doesn't think he's wrong. However, the key here is the impact on her feelings. The intention vs. impact debate. Even if he didn't mean to be hurtful, the fact that his words made her feel dumb matters. In relationships, acknowledging and validating each other's feelings is important. By dismissing her feelings as being too sensitive, he's not taking her perspective seriously.\n\nAlso, when she explained why it was offensive, his response was \"I don't care,\" which sounds dismissive. Even if he thought he was right, not caring about her feelings when she's upset is a problem. He might genuinely care, but his actions showed a lack of consideration. The fact that he's not willing to apologize might come off as not valuing her emotions, which is a red flag in a relationship.\n\nSo even if the conclusion was obvious, the way he communicated it was harmful. People's experiences and emotions are valid, and using words like \"obviously\" can unintentionally undermine someone. The author should probably be in the wrong here because he didn't consider how his words affected her, and he's not willing to apologize, which is a sign of not taking her feelings seriously.\n"
