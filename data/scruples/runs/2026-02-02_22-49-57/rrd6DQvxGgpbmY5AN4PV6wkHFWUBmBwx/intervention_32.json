The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author using the word \"obviously\" when discussing an experiment with their girlfriend. The girlfriend felt hurt because it made her feel dumb, while the author thinks they're not wrong because the conclusion was obvious.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author didn't mean to be snarky, just stating their opinion that the result was obvious. But the girlfriend clearly felt offended and hurt. The key here is understanding that communication can have unintended effects. Even if the word \"obviously\" wasn't used in a malicious way, it's a word that often comes off as dismissive or condescending, especially in a relationship. \n\nThe author mentions that the conclusion is a well-known concept, so maybe they assumed the girlfriend would know it. However, the girlfriend learned it in her class and found it interesting, not obvious. The author's assumption might have invalidated her experience of learning the concept. \n\nThe problem here is about empathy. The author is focusing on their perspective\u2014what they think is obvious\u2014and not considering how the word might be received. The girlfriend is pointing out that her feelings were hurt, and the author is dismissing that by saying they don't care if others are offended, which seems to be invalidating her feelings further. \n\nThe author's response to the girlfriend's explanation is key. By saying \"I don't care,\" they're not acknowledging her feelings, which is a red flag. Even if the author is sorry for hurting her, not being willing to apologize shows a lack of respect for her emotional experience. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to validate each other's feelings, even if you don't agree with the reaction. The author's insistence that it's a small thing and that the girlfriend shouldn't get offended might come off as dismissive. The girlfriend is seeking an apology because she feels wronged, and the author's refusal to apologize suggests a lack of willingness to repair the relationship. \n\nSo, even though the author might not have intended to hurt, the impact is what matters. The use of \"obviously\" can be hurtful in context, and the author's response to the hurt feelings exacerbates the issue. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because they failed to consider the emotional impact and dismissed their partner's feelings.\n"
