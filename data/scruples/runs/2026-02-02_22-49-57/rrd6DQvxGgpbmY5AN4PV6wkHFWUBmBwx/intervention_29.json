The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is talking about a conversation with their girlfriend where they discussed a psychology experiment. The author found the conclusion obvious and said so, using the word \"obviously.\" The girlfriend felt hurt because she didn't think it was obvious when she first learned about it. She felt the word made her feel dumb. The author didn't apologize and thinks the girlfriend is overreacting. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context. The girlfriend is a psych major, so the author might think she should know this. But even if the conclusion is well-known, maybe the experiment itself wasn't obvious to her when she first encountered it. The key here is the use of the word \"obviously.\" People often use that word in a way that can come off as dismissive or condescending, even if they don't mean it that way. The author claims they didn't say it snarkily, but the girlfriend still felt hurt. \n\nThe author's response to the girlfriend's feelings is problematic. When someone expresses that a word or action hurt them, the appropriate response is to acknowledge their feelings, even if you don't see it the same way. The author here said \"I don't care\" and told the girlfriend she should get over it. That's not showing empathy. Even if the author doesn't think the word was meant to be offensive, the effect was there, and the way they responded made things worse. \n\nThe author's insistence that the girlfriend is overreacting and that her feelings are invalid is a big red flag. In relationships, when someone's feelings are hurt, it's important to validate them, not argue about whether they \"should\" have been hurt. The author's refusal to apologize and their dismissive attitude (\"it wouldn't be offensive if she said it to me\") shows a lack of consideration for their partner's emotional experience. \n\nAlso, the author assumes that because the girlfriend is a psych major, she should have found it obvious. But being a psych major doesn't mean someone knows every experiment or conclusion off the top of their head. Maybe she learned it in class, but the experiment itself was complex, and the conclusion only became clear after discussion. The author's assumption that she should have seen it as obvious is a mistake. \n\nIn terms of communication, using \"obviously\" can be a trigger word because it implies that the other person is not seeing something that the speaker considers self-evident. Even if the speaker isn't intending to belittle, the word itself carries that tone. The girlfriend's reaction is a common one; many people find that word condescending. \n\nThe author's response to her feelings by saying \"I just don't care\" and telling her to move on further harms the relationship. It's not about whether the author thinks they're in the wrong, but about how their actions and responses affected the girlfriend. Even if the initial comment wasn't meant to hurt, the lack of empathy and the dismissiveness in the aftermath definitely contribute to the problem.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author might not have intended to hurt the girlfriend, but their use of the word \"obviously\" did cause hurt feelings, and their subsequent response was dismissive and invalidating. In healthy relationships, it's important to respect each other's feelings even when there's a disagreement about the cause. The author's actions and reactions here show a lack of that respect, so they are in the wrong.\n"
