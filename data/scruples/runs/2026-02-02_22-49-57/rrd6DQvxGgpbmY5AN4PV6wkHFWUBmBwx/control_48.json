The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about using the word \"obviously\" in a discussion with his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the author says the experiment's conclusion was obvious. The girlfriend felt hurt because she didn't think it was obvious when she learned it. The author defends using \"obviously\" because the conclusion is well-known and his girlfriend is a psych major, so he assumed she knew it.\n\nThe key points here are about communication and empathy. Even if the author didn't mean to be offensive, the word \"obviously\" can come off as dismissive. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt belittled. The author's response was to say \"I don't care\" when she explained her feelings, which shows a lack of empathy. Then, he says he needs her to not get offended by small things, which shifts the blame onto her instead of taking responsibility.\n\nEven if the conclusion is commonly known, the context matters. The girlfriend was sharing something she found cool, not expecting someone else to know it. The author's comment undermined her experience. The fact that he didn't apologize and dismissed her feelings makes it clear he's in the wrong. So the answer should be A.\n"
