The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author using the word \"obviously\" when discussing a psychology experiment with his girlfriend. The girlfriend felt hurt and offended, saying that using \"obviously\" made her feel dumb. The author, however, doesn't think he was wrong, arguing that the conclusion was indeed obvious and that he didn't mean any harm.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The key points are the use of the word \"obviously\" and the girlfriend's emotional response. The author claims he didn't use a snarky tone and that the conclusion was obvious, so he didn't see the issue. But the girlfriend felt it was a put-down, making her feel that her experience of finding the experiment cool and not obvious to her was dismissed.\n\nI remember that in communication, especially in relationships, the impact of words matters more than the intent. Even if the author didn't mean to be condescending, the girlfriend felt hurt. The term \"obviously\" can often come off as dismissive, implying that if someone didn't see it as obvious, they're lacking in intelligence or understanding. This is a common issue in discussions where one person assumes prior knowledge or understanding that others may not have.\n\nThe author's response to her feelings was to dismiss her perspective, stating he doesn't care about her feelings in this context and that it's a small issue. This lack of empathy is problematic. Even if he didn't intend to hurt her, acknowledging her feelings and apologizing is important in maintaining respect and understanding in a relationship. By refusing to apologize and instead telling her not to get offended, he's not taking her emotional response seriously, which can damage trust and communication.\n\nAdditionally, the girlfriend is a psych major, so she might have had a deeper or different understanding of the experiment's nuances. The author's assumption that she should have found it obvious ignores her individual experience of learning it. Everyone processes information differently, and what's obvious to one person might not be to another, even in the same field. The author's failure to recognize this difference shows a lack of consideration for her perspective.\n\nThe fact that the girlfriend brought up her hurt feelings and the author's reaction to her feelings being invalidated is a red flag. When someone feels their emotions are being dismissed, it can lead to resentment and further conflict. The author's stance that she should just get over it isn't helpful and could be seen as disrespectful.\n\nIn relationships, it's crucial to validate each other's feelings, even if you don't agree with the reasoning. The author's approach here seems more focused on being right about the obviousness of the experiment's conclusion than on maintaining emotional harmony. This can be a common pitfall where people prioritize their own perspective over their partner's emotional well-being.\n\nIn summary, while the author might not have had malicious intent, his failure to acknowledge and validate his girlfriend's feelings, combined with his dismissive attitude, places him in the wrong. The use of \"obviously\" in this context, despite the lack of snark, still had a negative impact, and his refusal to apologize shows a lack of empathy and respect for her emotions.\n"
