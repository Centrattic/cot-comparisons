The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about using the word \"obviously\" during a conversation about a psychology experiment. The girlfriend felt hurt because it made her feel dumb, while the author thinks it wasn't a big deal and doesn't see why he should apologize.\n\nHmm, first, the key point here is the use of the word \"obviously.\" Even though the author didn't mean it snarkily, the word itself can come off as dismissive. The girlfriend is a psych major, but maybe she was still learning and the experiment wasn't obvious to her at first. The author's assumption that it's obvious might overlook her experience and feelings.\n\nThe author says it's a well-known concept, but that doesn't mean everyone finds it obvious. People have different learning experiences and paces. By using \"obviously,\" the author might have unintentionally belittled her understanding. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt her feelings were hurt. The author's response, saying \"I don't care\" when she expressed her feelings, and then not apologizing, shows a lack of consideration for her perspective.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the girlfriend \"should have just gotten over it,\" which suggests a dismissal of her emotional response. That's not healthy in a relationship. Even if the author didn't intend to hurt her, the impact is still real. The ability to empathize and acknowledge her feelings is important here. So, even if the author didn't mean anything negative, the action still caused hurt, making him at least partly responsible.\n"
