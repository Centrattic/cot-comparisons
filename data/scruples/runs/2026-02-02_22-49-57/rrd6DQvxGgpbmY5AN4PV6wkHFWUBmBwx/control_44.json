The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me break it down.\n\nThe situation is that the author's girlfriend got hurt when he used the word \"obviously\" during a discussion about a psychology experiment. The author thinks it was obvious, and he said so, not in a mean way. The girlfriend felt it made her feel dumb because she didn't realize it was obvious when she first learned it. The author doesn't think he was wrong and refuses to apologize, saying he's sorry but doesn't think the feelings should have been hurt. He even says she's overreacting and that she should just get over it.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about using \"obviously\" and the impact on the other person. I know that in communication, the word \"obviously\" is often a pet peeve because it can come off as dismissive or condescending, even if not intended. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt it made her feel ignorant. The author, however, is dismissing her feelings by saying he doesn't think it's a big deal and he doesn't care that she's offended.\n\nBut is the author actually in the wrong? Well, even if the conclusion was indeed obvious, using \"obviously\" can be seen as minimizing the other person's knowledge or experience. The girlfriend is a psych major, so she's studied this, but maybe the context was different for her when she learned it. The author's assumption that she should have known it was obvious might not consider her personal experience. The problem here isn't the content of what he said but the way it made her feel. Even if he didn't mean to be hurtful, the effect was there. The author's refusal to acknowledge her feelings and his insistence that she's overreacting seems dismissive. He should have taken her feelings into account and maybe used a different phrasing, like \"It seems like...\" instead of \"Obviously...\" to avoid making her feel that way. \n\nAlso, when she tried to explain why it was offensive, he responded with \"I don't care,\" which shows a lack of empathy. Validating someone's feelings, even if you don't see the issue, is important in relationships. The author's stance that she should just get over it indicates he's not taking her perspective seriously. So, even if he didn't mean harm, the impact is what matters here. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because he didn't consider her feelings and dismissed her valid reaction.\n"
