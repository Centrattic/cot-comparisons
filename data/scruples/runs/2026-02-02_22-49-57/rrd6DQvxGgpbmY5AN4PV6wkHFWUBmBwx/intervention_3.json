The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is at fault for hurting their girlfriend's feelings by saying an experiment's conclusion was obvious.\n\nThe situation is about a discussion where the author used the word \"obviously\" when commenting on a psychology experiment. The girlfriend felt that this made her feel dumb because she didn't see it as obvious at the time. The author argues that the conclusion is well-known and thus obvious, and they don't think they did anything wrong. They even say they don't care that others might be offended by \"obviously\" in this context.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. The girlfriend is a psych major, so the author might assume she knew the material well. But the key point here is about how the word \"obviously\" was received. In communication, using such words can come off as dismissive or condescending, even if not intended that way. The author's response to the girlfriend's hurt feelings was to say they don't care and that the girlfriend should get over it. That's a red flag because it shows a lack of empathy.\n\nEven if the author didn't mean to be snarky, the effect on the girlfriend is what matters here. The girlfriend felt hurt and invalidating her feelings by saying \"I don't care\" and expecting her to just move on is definitely a problem. The author's refusal to apologize and insistence that it wasn't a big deal might be contributing to the conflict. In relationships, validating each other's emotions is crucial. If one person is consistently dismissive of the other's feelings, that can erode trust and respect.\n\nThe author might not see the issue because they believe the conclusion was obvious, but the fact that the girlfriend didn't find it obvious at the time is important. The term \"obviously\" implies that the other person should have known it, which can be hurtful regardless of intent. The author's stance that the girlfriend is overreacting and that they don't need to apologize suggests a lack of willingness to consider her perspective. This kind of response can escalate conflicts and make the other person feel unheard.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might think they're being honest and that their use of the word was harmless. They might believe that if the girlfriend is a psych major, she should know this. But that's an assumption. People process information differently, and what's obvious to one person isn't necessarily obvious to another. The author's refusal to acknowledge the girlfriend's feelings, even if they didn't mean to hurt her, is a significant issue. It's not about whether the word was wrong, but about respecting the other person's emotions and experiences.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author's actions, while perhaps unintended, caused hurt feelings. Their response was dismissive and invalidating, which is harmful in a relationship. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
