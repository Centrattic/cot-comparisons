The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for this situation. The scenario is about a disagreement where the author used the word \"obviously\" in a conversation about a psychology experiment with their girlfriend. The girlfriend felt hurt and thought the word was offensive, making her feel dumb. The author, however, thinks the conclusion was obvious and that the girlfriend shouldn't have been offended.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are about communication and sensitivity. The author didn't mean to be dismissive or hurtful, but the girlfriend felt disrespected. The use of \"obviously\" can often come off as condescending, even if not intended that way. Even though the author didn't use it in a snarky way, the word itself can imply that the other person should have known it already, which can be hurtful, especially in a relationship where mutual respect is important.\n\nThe author's response after the girlfriend expressed her feelings was to say \"I don't care\" and dismiss her feelings as being too sensitive. That's problematic because it's about not acknowledging her perspective. Even if the author truly believes the conclusion was obvious, the main issue here is about how their choice of words affected her. Relationships require both partners to consider each other's feelings and be empathetic.\n\nThe girlfriend is a psych major, so the author might have assumed she knew the concept well. However, just because it's a well-known concept doesn't mean she already knew it. People can learn things at different times, and it's possible she was still processing it when she first learned. The author's use of \"obviously\" could have undermined her experience of learning something new and exciting.\n\nAlso, when the girlfriend tried to explain why it was offensive, the author didn't validate her feelings. Instead, they dismissed her again by saying she should get over it. That's not healthy communication. In a relationship, it's important to listen and validate each other's emotions, even if you don't agree with the reaction. The author's refusal to apologize and their stance that it's a small issue shows a lack of understanding of her emotional needs.\n\nSo, putting this all together, even if the author didn't have bad intentions, their actions still hurt the girlfriend. The way they responded by dismissing her feelings is definitely wrong. They should have used a more considerate word instead of \"obviously\" and should have listened and apologized when she was upset. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
