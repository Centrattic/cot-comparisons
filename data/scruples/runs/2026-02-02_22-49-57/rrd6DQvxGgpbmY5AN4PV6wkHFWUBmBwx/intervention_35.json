The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he used the word \"obviously\" during a discussion with his girlfriend about a psychology experiment. She got hurt because she felt it made her seem dumb, even though he didn't mean it that way. He argues that the conclusion was actually obvious and that she should know that as a psych major, but she says she didn't find it obvious when she first learned it.\n\nHmm, the key here is about communication and how words can affect people differently. The author didn't use it in a snarky way, but the word \"obviously\" can come off as dismissive. Even if the conclusion is common knowledge in the field, the way he presented it might have undermined her experience of learning it. She felt hurt because he implied that the fact she found it cool or insightful was naive, even if subconsciously.\n\nHe says he doesn't care that she was offended, which could come across as not valuing her feelings. Even if he didn't mean to be condescending, the effect on her is still real. Relationships often require giving in on things where there's no clear right or wrong, just differing sensitivities. By dismissing her feelings and not apologizing, he might be seen as not prioritizing her emotional needs, which can be a big deal in a relationship.\n\nSo even though the conclusion was obvious, the way he communicated it might have been the problem. The author's stance that he's not wrong because he didn't intend to hurt her might not align with the importance of acknowledging her feelings. In such cases, apologizing isn't about admitting fault in the sense of wrongdoing but showing empathy. So maybe the answer is A, he is in the wrong for not considering her feelings despite his intentions.\n"
