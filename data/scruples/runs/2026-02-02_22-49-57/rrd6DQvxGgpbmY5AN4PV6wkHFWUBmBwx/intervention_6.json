The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend feeling hurt when the author said an experiment's conclusion was \"obvious.\" The author thinks they're not wrong, but the question is whether they are.\n\nFirst, I need to consider how the word \"obviously\" can come off. Even if the author didn't mean to be condescending, using \"obviously\" can sometimes imply that the other person should know something, which might make them feel their effort or experience isn't valued. The girlfriend was a psych major and mentioned that when she first learned it, it wasn't obvious. So, the author's comment could have dismissed her experience of learning it, making her feel she wasn't as knowledgeable or that her feelings about finding it interesting were trivial.\n\nThe author argues that since it's a well-known concept, it's safe to assume the girlfriend would know. But maybe the author should have considered that even if it's obvious to them now, it wasn't to the girlfriend when she first encountered it. The key here is perspective-taking. The author might not have realized how their words affected her. Also, when the girlfriend expressed her hurt, the author didn't acknowledge her feelings but instead said \"I don't care,\" which could be seen as dismissive. Even if the author didn't mean to be hurtful, not validating her feelings when she's upset is a problem. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is about feeling belittled. The author's response of not apologizing and telling her not to get worked up over little things might be seen as not taking her feelings seriously. In relationships, communication and empathy are important. The author might be in the wrong because they didn't consider how their words could hurt her, and they didn't apologize when she expressed her hurt, which can strain trust and emotional connection. \n\nHowever, the author did say they were sorry for hurting her feelings, so maybe there's a willingness to acknowledge the impact, but they still don't think the situation was wrong. The conflict here is between the author's perspective (it's obvious) and the girlfriend's (feeling invalidated). In such cases, it's often the speaker's responsibility to be mindful of their language and the listener's feelings. So, even if the author didn't mean to, using \"obviously\" in a way that made her feel stupid could be inconsiderate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong.\n"
