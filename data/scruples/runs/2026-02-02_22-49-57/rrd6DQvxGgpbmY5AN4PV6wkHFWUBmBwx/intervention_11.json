The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is about using the word \"obviously\" in a conversation with their girlfriend. The girlfriend felt hurt because she didn't realize the conclusion was obvious when she first learned about the experiment. The author argues that the conclusion really is obvious and that it's safe to assume a psychology major would know that.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are about communication and empathy. The author used a word (\"obviously\") that can often come off as dismissive or condescending. Even if the author didn't intend to be snarky, the word itself can carry that implication. The girlfriend felt her feelings were hurt because she associated the word with being belittled. The author is now defending their use of the word by saying it was obvious and that they didn't mean to offend, but the girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt that way.\n\nThe author is also dismissing her feelings by saying they don't care about her feelings and that she shouldn't get upset over little things. That part seems problematic because it's important to validate someone's feelings, even if you don't agree with their interpretation. The author's response of \"I don't care\" and telling the girlfriend to get over it is likely exacerbating the situation. Even if the author didn't mean to hurt her, the way they responded after realizing it did hurt her shows a lack of empathy.\n\nIn relationships, it's about how you handle conflicts and respect each other's perspectives. The fact that the author is trying to argue that the girlfriend's feelings are invalid suggests a lack of consideration for her emotional experience. The author might not be in the wrong for the initial comment if they truly didn't mean to offend, but their handling of the aftermath and refusal to apologize could be where they are in the wrong. The key here is that even if the conclusion was obvious, the communication method caused hurt, and the response to that hurt was dismissive. So, the author is in the wrong because they didn't take responsibility and invalidated her feelings.\n"
