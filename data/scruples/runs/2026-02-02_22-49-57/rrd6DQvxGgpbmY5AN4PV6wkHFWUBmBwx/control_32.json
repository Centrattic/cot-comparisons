The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for making their girlfriend feel hurt by using the word \"obviously\" during a conversation about a psychology experiment.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend is a psych major, so it's possible she expected the conclusion to be something she already knew. But she didn't realize it was obvious when she first learned it. The author says it was obvious and didn't mean to be snarky, but the girlfriend felt it made her feel dumb. \n\nNow, the key here is the use of the word \"obviously.\" Even if the author didn't intend it that way, that word can come off as dismissive. People might interpret it as patronizing, especially if they didn't see the conclusion as obvious. The author assumes that because she's a psych major, she should have known it was obvious, but that's an assumption based on his own perspective. He's not considering that her experience when she first learned it wasn't obvious, so the word \"obviously\" could make her feel like her initial reaction was wrong.\n\nThe author then dismisses her feelings by saying \"I don't care\" and later tells her to not get offended over little things. That's definitely invalidating her emotions. Even if he didn't mean to be rude, the fact that his words hurt her should be acknowledged. Insisting that she's overreacting or that others wouldn't be offended isn't helpful. People have different sensitivities, and it's important to validate how others feel, even if you don't see it the same way.\n\nThe author also mentions not caring about her feelings in the moment, which is a big red flag. Relationships require empathy and the willingness to apologize even if you don't see the issue the same way. By refusing to apologize and trying to explain why it's not a big deal, he's not taking responsibility for his part in hurting her feelings.\n\nIn summary, the author's use of \"obviously\" was careless, even if unintended. Dismissing her feelings and refusing to apologize shows a lack of empathy. So, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
