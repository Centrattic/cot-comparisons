The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a disagreement between a couple where the author said something was \"obvious,\" which upset his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author was discussing a psychology experiment with his girlfriend. He used the word \"obviously\" to describe the experiment's conclusion, which he thought was clear. His girlfriend felt hurt because he used that word, making her feel dumb. She was a psych major and didn't find it obvious when she first learned it. The author doesn't think he was wrong, arguing that the conclusion was indeed obvious and that many people might not be offended. He even says he doesn't care about her feelings on the matter now.\n\nI should consider both sides. On one hand, the author might have a point if the conclusion truly is a well-known concept. However, the problem here is the use of the word \"obviously.\" Even if the conclusion is obvious, using that word can come off as dismissive. People often feel belittled when someone says something is obvious, especially if they didn't see it that way initially. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt her feelings were hurt. \n\nThe author's response to her feelings is dismissive. He not only didn't acknowledge her feelings but also told her not to get offended over small things. That's a red flag. In relationships, it's important to validate each other's emotions. Even if you don't agree, acknowledging that their feelings are valid is crucial. By saying \"I don't care,\" the author is invalidating her experience. \n\nAlso, the author's refusal to apologize and his insistence that it shouldn't be a big deal shows a lack of empathy. The fact that he's a psych major might mean he understands how people process information differently. But he's dismissing her personal experience of not finding it obvious. \n\nThe girlfriend's point about the word \"obviously\" being offensive is a common issue. Studies and communication guides often mention that using such language can be condescending. The author's defense that he didn't mean it snarkily doesn't change the impact on her. \n\nSo, even if the conclusion was obvious, the way it was communicated hurt her. The author's failure to validate her feelings and his dismissive attitude are key factors. The answer should be that he is in the wrong because of his response to her feelings rather than the initial comment itself.\n"
