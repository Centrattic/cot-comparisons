The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is at fault. The situation involves a disagreement between a couple about using the word \"obviously\" during a conversation about a psychology experiment.\n\nFirst, the author said the experiment's conclusion was obvious. The girlfriend felt hurt because the word \"obviously\" made her feel dumb. She was proud of learning it and didn't find it obvious then. The author thinks the conclusion is common knowledge, so he didn't mean any harm.\n\nNow, considering communication dynamics, using \"obviously\" can come off as dismissive. Even if the author didn't intend it to be snarky, the word itself can invalidate someone's feelings. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt her experience wasn't respected. The key here is intent vs. impact. The author might not have meant to hurt, but the impact was negative. The girlfriend felt disrespected, and the author's refusal to apologize suggests he's not acknowledging her feelings, which is problematic in a relationship. Healthy relationships require empathy and validating each other's emotions. Even if the point is trivial, dismissing someone's feelings can lead to bigger issues. So, the author is in the wrong for not respecting her feelings and not being willing to apologize.\n"
