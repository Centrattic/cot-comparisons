The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is at fault for hurting their girlfriend's feelings by using the word \"obviously\" when discussing a psychology experiment.\n\nFirst, the key points from the scenario: The author said the experiment's conclusion was obvious. The girlfriend felt insulted because she didn't find it obvious when she first learned it. The author is defending his use of the word, saying it was just stating a fact and not in a snarky way. The girlfriend felt it made her feel dumb, and the author is reluctant to apologize, thinking it's not a big deal.\n\nNow, considering social norms and communication in relationships. Using \"obviously\" can often come off as dismissive, even if not intended. Even if the conclusion is common knowledge, the person might not have realized that at the time. The author's insistence that he wasn't wrong and that the girlfriend shouldn't get offended might show a lack of empathy. Acknowledging someone's feelings, even if you don't fully agree, is usually important in maintaining respect and emotional connection. The author's response of \"I don't care\" and telling her to \"get over it\" could be seen as invalidating her emotions, which is a common source of conflict in relationships. \n\nEven if the author didn't mean to be hurtful, the impact on the girlfriend is real. The question is about whether he's in the wrong. In many such cases, the person's intention isn't the main point\u2014it's the effect. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not recognizing how his words affected her and not apologizing. The fact that he's unwilling to apologize despite hurting her feelings suggests he's not taking her feelings seriously, which is a problem. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he dismissed her feelings and didn't take responsibility, even though his words had a negative impact.\n"
