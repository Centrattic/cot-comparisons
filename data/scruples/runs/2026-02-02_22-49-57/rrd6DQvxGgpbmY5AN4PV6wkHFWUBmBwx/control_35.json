The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for using the word \"obviously\" during a conversation with his girlfriend. The girlfriend felt hurt because she didn't find the conclusion obvious when she first learned it, and she felt the author was making her feel dumb. The author thinks it was obvious and doesn't see why it's a big deal, even saying he doesn't care about her feelings in this context.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The author states he does care about her feelings but doesn't think she should take it so personally. However, his response of \"I don't care\" and telling her to get over it might be problematic. Even if he didn't mean to be snarky, the word \"obviously\" can come off as dismissive. People's feelings are valid, even if the situation seems trivial to the other person.\n\nThe girlfriend is a psych major, so she's aware of how communication affects emotions. The author dismissing her feelings by saying he doesn't care and that it's not a big thing could be seen as invalidating her experience. In relationships, respecting each other's emotions is key, even if you don't fully understand why someone is upset. The fact that she felt hurt and is asking for an apology is significant. The author's refusal to apologize and his stance that her feelings shouldn't matter might indicate a lack of empathy.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might believe the conclusion was indeed obvious. However, communication isn't just about the content but also the delivery and perception. If the author had phrased it more gently, maybe without \"obviously,\" the situation could have been avoided. But since he used that word, regardless of intent, the impact on her was negative.\n\nThe key here is whether the author should have been more considerate. Even if he didn't mean to offend, the word choice was hurtful. In relationships, partners should be understanding of each other's sensitivities. The author's reaction to her feelings (telling her to get over it) is likely the bigger issue here. He's not respecting her emotional response, which is essential for maintaining trust and empathy in a relationship.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because he dismissed his girlfriend's feelings and didn't acknowledge her perspective, even though he claimed to care. The use of \"obviously\" was the initial misstep, but his subsequent responses made it worse. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
