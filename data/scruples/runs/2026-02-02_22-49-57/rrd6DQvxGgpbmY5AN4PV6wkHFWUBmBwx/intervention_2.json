The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the scenario again.\n\nThe author is talking about a situation where he and his girlfriend were discussing a psychology experiment. She told him about an experiment she learned in class, and he responded by saying the conclusion was obvious. She took offense to using the word \"obviously\" because it made her feel dumb. He argues that the conclusion was indeed obvious and that as a psych major, she should have known it was obvious. He doesn't think he's wrong for using the word and doesn't want to apologize because he doesn't think it was a big deal. She feels hurt and wants an apology, but he thinks she's overreacting.\n\nHmm. The key here is understanding why using \"obviously\" is problematic. Even if the conclusion is obvious to the speaker, using that word can come off as dismissive. The girlfriend's feelings are hurt because she didn't realize it was obvious when she first learned it. She found it cool, which suggests she might have put effort into understanding it, and his comment undermined her experience.\n\nThe author's defense is that he's not trying to be snarky and that the conclusion is indeed well-known. But the issue isn't the facts; it's about how his comment made her feel. The problem with \"obviously\" is that it can invalidate the other person's feelings or perception. Even if the conclusion is obvious to him, she had a different experience. By saying it's obvious, he's implying that her not knowing it immediately is a failing, which is hurtful.\n\nHe also mentions that he doesn't think he should apologize and that she should just get over it. That's a red flag. Relationships require empathy and validation of each other's feelings. Dismissing her feelings by saying she's overreacting isn't helpful. Even if he didn't intend to hurt her, the impact of his words matters. Validating her feelings doesn't mean he's wrong, but it's about respecting her emotional experience.\n\nThe author's stance that she should \"not get offended about little things\" is problematic. It's not about the size of the issue but about the emotional response. People have different sensitivities, and it's important to acknowledge that without judgment. Insisting that she shouldn't be hurt because he doesn't think it's a big deal is refusing to see her perspective.\n\nSo even if the conclusion was obvious, the way he communicated it was hurtful. The word \"obviously\" can carry a condescending tone. The fact that she's a psych major might mean she's aware of the concepts, but her personal experience of learning it and finding it cool is valid. His response didn't consider her feelings and instead minimized her experience.\n\nIn relationships, it's crucial to consider how your words affect others. Even if you don't mean to, using language that belittles someone's experience can be harmful. The author's refusal to apologize and his dismissive attitude towards her feelings suggest that he's in the wrong. He needs to recognize that her feelings are valid and apologize to show that he cares about her perspective.\n"
