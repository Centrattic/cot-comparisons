The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The author is asking if they're in the wrong for hurting their girlfriend's feelings by using the word \"obviously\" when talking about a psychology experiment.\n\nSo, the situation is that the author and their girlfriend were discussing an experiment. The author said the conclusion was obvious. The girlfriend felt that using \"obviously\" made her feel dumb because, to her, it wasn't obvious when she first learned about it. She's a psych major, so the author thought maybe she should have known it was obvious. But she was hurt and wants an apology.\n\nThe author is defending their use of the word, saying it was just stating a fact and that they don't think they were wrong. They mention that they don't care about other people's feelings when it comes to such things and even told the girlfriend to not get offended over little things.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about communication and emotional sensitivity. The author is focusing on the logic of the situation\u2014since the conclusion is well-known and obvious, they thought it was safe to say so. But the girlfriend's reaction is about her personal experience and feelings at the time she learned it. She didn't find it obvious then, and the author's comment made her feel invalidated.\n\nIn relationships, communication isn't just about the facts but also about how we express them. Using words like \"obviously\" can come off as dismissive, even if not intended that way. The author might not have meant to be condescending, but the impact on the girlfriend was hurtful. The author is also not acknowledging her feelings and is resisting apologizing, which could be seen as dismissive of her emotional response.\n\nThe girlfriend felt her feelings were invalidated when the author didn't acknowledge the hurt. The author's response of \"I don't care\" about her feelings in this context might be part of the issue. Even if the author cares overall, not recognizing the specific hurt here can damage trust and emotional connection.\n\nSo, while the author might not have intended to be rude, the effect on the girlfriend is what matters here. In such situations, it's important to validate each other's feelings, even if you don't agree with the reaction. The author's refusal to apologize and insistence that it's not a big deal could be seen as being in the wrong because they're not prioritizing their partner's emotional well-being in this instance.\n"
