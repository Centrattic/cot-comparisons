The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author asked if they're in the wrong for hurting their girlfriend's feelings by using the word \"obviously.\" The situation is that they were discussing a psychology experiment, and the author found the conclusion obvious. The girlfriend felt that using \"obviously\" made her feel dumb because she didn't find it obvious at first.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of the girlfriend. She's a psych major, so maybe she's used to learning complex concepts. But when she first learned about the experiment, she didn't realize it was obvious, and now the author pointing it out as obvious made her feel she didn't understand it. That's a common issue with words like \"obviously\"\u2014they can come across as dismissive, even if not intended. Even if the conclusion is a well-known concept, pointing out that someone else didn't see it as obvious at the time is valid.\n\nThe author argues that they didn't mean to be snarky and that the conclusion really is obvious. They also mention they don't care that the girlfriend is hurt and think the girlfriend is overreacting. The key here is the author's response after the girlfriend expressed her feelings. Instead of validating her feelings, the author dismissed them by saying \"I don't care\" and told her to get over it. That's problematic because even if the author didn't mean to offend, the impact on the girlfriend's feelings is real. The author's refusal to acknowledge her feelings and insistence that it's not a big thing can be seen as invalidating.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Using words like \"obviously\" can sometimes belittle the other person's experience, even if unintended. The girlfriend felt hurt, and the author's response to that hurt was dismissive. Even if the author believes they're not at fault, the way they handled the situation could be considered inconsiderate. The author's refusal to apologize and their stance that the girlfriend should not get offended over such things shows a lack of empathy towards her feelings. \n\nWhile the author might not have intended harm, the fact remains that their words caused hurt. In such cases, it's important to recognize the other person's perspective and feelings, even if you don't agree. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt disrespected. The author's insistence that she shouldn't be upset and their dismissal of her feelings are where they might be in the wrong. The correct approach would have been to apologize, acknowledge her feelings, and perhaps explain that the intention wasn't to belittle her. Instead, the author's response exacerbated the situation, leading to more conflict.\n\nSo considering all that, the author's actions, while perhaps not malicious, were dismissive and invalidating, which is inconsiderate. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
