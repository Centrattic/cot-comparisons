The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about using the word \"obviously\" during a conversation with his girlfriend, which hurt her feelings.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author says he didn't mean to be snarky and that the conclusion really is obvious. He's a psych major, so he assumed his girlfriend, also a psych major, would find it obvious too. But she felt offended because she didn't see it as obvious when she first learned it. She felt stupid and he invalidated her feelings by not caring and not apologizing. \n\nNow, the key points here. Using the word \"obviously\" can be dismissive. Even if the author didn't intend it that way, the effect on his girlfriend was hurtful. The question is whether intent matters more than the impact. In relationships, emotional sensitivity is important. Even if the author believes the conclusion was obvious, his girlfriend's experience is valid. Insisting that she shouldn't feel that way and not apologizing shows a lack of empathy, which is a problem. \n\nThe author argues that he doesn't think her feelings should be hurt and that he doesn't care about others' feelings in such cases. That's a red flag. Relationships require mutual respect and consideration. Dismissing her feelings as being too sensitive isn't healthy. Apologizing isn't just about being right or wrong; it's about acknowledging the other person's feelings and maintaining the relationship. \n\nAlso, the fact that she was a psych major doesn't necessarily mean she knew the experiment's conclusion was obvious. Maybe the experiment's design had nuances she was still learning about. The author's assumption that she should know it was obvious might be his own overconfidence. \n\nSo, even if the author's intention wasn't malicious, the outcome was hurtful. In such cases, the impact on the other person matters. Not apologizing and telling her to \"get over it\" is inconsiderate. The answer would be that the author is in the wrong because he didn't validate her feelings and refused to apologize despite causing hurt.\n"
