The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he's arguing with his girlfriend about a psychological experiment. She told him about it, and he said the conclusion was obvious. She took that as offensive because she felt it made her look dumb, even though as a psych major, he assumed she should have known it was obvious.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their communication. The word \"obviously\" can come off as dismissive, even if not intended that way. When someone shares something they found interesting or learned, especially in a subject they're studying, implying that it's obvious might make them feel their effort or insight isn't valued. The author might have thought he was just agreeing, but the way he phrased it could have undermined her experience.\n\nThe girlfriend's perspective is important. She felt hurt because the experiment wasn't obvious to her at first. She took pride in learning it, and his comment made her feel like her initial confusion or the process of understanding it was trivial. Even if the conclusion is a well-known concept, the author's use of \"obviously\" could be seen as belittling her. It's possible he didn't realize how words like that can carry negative connotations, especially in a close relationship where sensitivity is key.\n\nAlso, when she tried to explain why it was offensive, he responded with \"I don\u2019t care,\" which is definitely a problem. Even if he didn't mean to be hurtful, dismissing her feelings like that shows a lack of empathy. The author then says he needs her to not get offended over little things. That's a bit of a deflective response. Instead of acknowledging her feelings, he's shifting the blame onto her for overreacting. That's probably not the healthiest approach in a relationship.\n\nIn relationships, it's crucial to validate each other's emotions. Just because the author didn't intend to hurt her doesn't mean he wasn't in the wrong. The fact that she felt stupid is a valid reaction, and his refusal to apologize despite her being hurt could be seen as insensitive. People often have different sensitivities, and if he's a psych major, he might know that perception and emotional responses vary. Maybe he should have been more considerate in his wording.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author probably is in the wrong. He used a word that made her feel disrespected, didn't acknowledge her feelings when she expressed them, and instead of apologizing, he's trying to justify his actions. Even if the conclusion is obvious, the way he communicated it mattered. The key here is about how he handled her reaction rather than the content of the comment itself. Therefore, the answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
