The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author said something was \"obviously\" the case during a discussion, and their girlfriend felt hurt because she didn't find it obvious at the time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider why the girlfriend was upset. She's a psych major, so maybe she expected the concept to be well-known but still found it non-obvious when she first learned it. The author's use of \"obviously\" might have made her feel like her experience of learning it wasn't validated. She felt dumb, which is a strong reaction. \n\nThe author argues that the conclusion is well-known and obvious, so using \"obviously\" was justified. They also mention they didn't say it in a snarky way. However, they dismissed her feelings by saying \"I don't care\" when she tried to explain why the word was offensive. That part seems problematic. Even if the author didn't intend to hurt her feelings, the response of not caring about her feelings comes off as dismissive and rude. \n\nCommunication is key in relationships. Even if the author didn't mean to, the word \"obviously\" can be seen as condescending. The fact that the girlfriend felt hurt and tried to explain her perspective, but the author kept defending their stance without empathy, suggests that the author isn't acknowledging her feelings adequately. \n\nThe author says they don't think the issue should be a big deal and even told the girlfriend to not get offended by little things. This attitude might be part of the problem. In healthy relationships, both parties should respect each other's feelings, even if they don't fully agree. Dismissing someone's emotions as trivial can lead to more issues over time. \n\nSo, even if the author's intention was neutral, the impact of their words and their subsequent response (not caring and invalidating her feelings) is harmful. The right thing to do would be to apologize, acknowledge her feelings, and perhaps be more mindful of how certain phrases come across. \n\nTherefore, the author is likely in the wrong because they hurt the girlfriend's feelings and responded in a way that didn't validate her emotions, even if unintentionally. The answer should be A.\n"
