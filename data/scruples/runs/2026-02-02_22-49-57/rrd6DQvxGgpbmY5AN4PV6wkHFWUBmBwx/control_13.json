The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a disagreement between the author and his girlfriend over the use of the word \"obviously\" during a discussion about a psychology experiment.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author thought the experiment's conclusion was obvious and said so, using the word \"obviously.\" His girlfriend felt that using \"obviously\" was offensive and made her feel dumb. She's a psych major, and even though the conclusion was well-known, she didn't find it obvious when she first learned it. The author argues that he didn't mean to be snarky and that it was safe to assume it was obvious to her. He also says he doesn't think her feelings should have been hurt and doesn't want to apologize. The girlfriend is upset because he dismissed her feelings and called her overreacting.\n\nNow, the key points here are about communication and empathy. The word \"obviously\" can often come off as dismissive, even if not intended that way. The author's girlfriend felt hurt, which is a valid emotional response. Even if the conclusion was indeed obvious, the way it was communicated might have been hurtful. The author's response to her feelings by saying \"I don't care\" and telling her not to get offended is problematic. He's not acknowledging her emotional experience, which is a red flag in any relationship.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to validate each other's feelings, even if you don't see them the same way. The author's refusal to apologize and his dismissal of her feelings as being over the top suggests a lack of emotional support and understanding. Even if the author didn't mean to be offensive, the impact on his girlfriend is real. The fact that she felt stupid and hurt is significant, and the author should take responsibility for that.\n\nMoreover, the author's justification that he wouldn't be offended if she said something similar to him is a classic example of the \"if it were me\" fallacy. People don't always react the same way in the same situations. What matters is how the other person actually feels, not how you would feel. The author's response to her explanation about why the word was offensive by invalidating her perspective is not helpful. Instead of defending his words, he should have listened and shown empathy.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the right here. He used a word that, while maybe not intended to be hurtful, had a negative impact on his girlfriend. His refusal to acknowledge her feelings and his dismissive attitude towards her valid reaction is where he's in the wrong. The right approach would have been to apologize, acknowledge her feelings, and communicate more sensitively in the future.\n"
