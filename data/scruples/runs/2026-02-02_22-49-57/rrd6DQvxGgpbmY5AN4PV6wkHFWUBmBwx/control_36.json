The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about using the word \"obviously\" during a discussion with their girlfriend, which led to her feeling hurt. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author's girlfriend is a psych major and was talking about an experiment. The author found the conclusion obvious and said so, using the word \"obviously.\" The girlfriend felt that made her feel dumb because she didn't find it obvious at the time she learned it. The author argues that the conclusion was well-known and obvious, so using that word wasn't wrong. He also says he doesn't care that she's upset and that he doesn't think he should apologize.\n\nNow, considering social norms and communication in relationships. The word \"obviously\" can often come off as dismissive, even if not intended. It might imply that the other person should have known something, which can be hurtful. Even if the author didn't mean it snarkily, the effect on the girlfriend was negative. The key here is about empathy and acknowledging her feelings.\n\nThe author's response to her feelings is dismissive. He says \"I don't care\" and tells her to not get offended about \"little things.\" That's not a good approach. In relationships, it's important to validate each other's feelings, even if you don't agree. The fact that the girlfriend was in a field where she took the experiment seriously, and the author downplayed her experience, could have added to her hurt.\n\nAlso, the concept of \"well-known\" vs. \"obvious to her at the time.\" The author might think it's obvious now, but she was learning it and didn't see it as obvious then. The author's use of \"obviously\" might have invalidated her learning experience. People can feel belittled when their past understanding is criticized, even if the current situation is clear.\n\nThe author's refusal to apologize and his insistence that it's a \"big thing\" shows a lack of effort to reconcile. Healthy relationships require compromise and understanding. Even if the author doesn't see the issue, his response of invalidating her feelings makes him at fault.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because he used a word that hurt her feelings, and then dismissed her emotions instead of showing empathy and apologizing.\n"
