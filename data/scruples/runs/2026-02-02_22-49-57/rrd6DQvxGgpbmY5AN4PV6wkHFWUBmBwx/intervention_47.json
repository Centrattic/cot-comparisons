The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author saying something was \"obviously\" obvious to their girlfriend, which she found offensive.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author used the word \"obviously\" when discussing a psychology experiment. They didn't mean it snarkily but just stated their opinion. The girlfriend felt it made her feel dumb because she didn't realize it was obvious when she first learned about it. The author thinks she's overreacting because the conclusion was indeed a well-known concept, and as a psych major, she should have known it was obvious. \n\nFrom a communication perspective, using \"obviously\" can come off as dismissive or condescending, even if not intended that way. The girlfriend's feelings are hurt because she felt her experience of finding the experiment cool and not obvious was invalidated. The author's response to her feelings was dismissive as well, saying they don't care about her feelings, even though they claim to care. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that the conclusion was obvious, so it's safe to assume she would know that. However, the girlfriend's reaction is valid because people can have different experiences and levels of prior knowledge, even within the same field. The key here is empathy. The author should have considered how the word might be taken, regardless of their intention. The fact that the author dismisses her feelings by saying \"I don't care\" and tells her to get over it shows a lack of empathy and willingness to understand her perspective. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to validate each other's feelings, even if they seem trivial. The author's refusal to apologize and insistence that it's a small thing might be the real issue here. Even if the author didn't mean to be hurtful, the impact on the girlfriend is real. The question of whether the author is in the wrong hinges on their response to her feelings rather than just the initial comment. Dismissing someone's feelings when they are hurt is generally considered wrong because it shows a lack of respect for their emotional experience.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would likely be that the author is in the wrong because they invalidated their partner's feelings and failed to show empathy, even if their initial intention wasn't malicious.\n"
