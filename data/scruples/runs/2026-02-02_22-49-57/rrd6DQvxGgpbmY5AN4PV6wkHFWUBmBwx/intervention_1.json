The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple discussing a psychology experiment, where the boyfriend says the conclusion was \"obvious\" and the girlfriend felt offended.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points here. The author (the boyfriend) used the word \"obviously\" to describe the experiment's conclusion. The girlfriend felt that this made her feel dumb because she didn't consider it obvious at the time she learned it. The author argues that the conclusion is widely known and that as a psych major, she should have found it obvious. He also mentions that he didn't mean to be snarky and that he doesn't think her feelings should have been hurt.\n\nNow, considering communication in relationships. Even if the intention wasn't to be dismissive or rude, the use of \"obviously\" can come off as condescending. People often feel belittled when their knowledge or understanding is questioned, especially in a way that implies they should have known something. The girlfriend's reaction is a common one when someone's self-esteem or perceived competence is challenged.\n\nThe author also says he doesn't care about her feelings in this case and that she shouldn't get worked up over \"little things.\" This response seems dismissive of her emotions. Even if the author believes he's right, it's important to validate the other person's feelings. In relationships, empathy and acknowledging how one's words affect others are crucial.\n\nSo, the main points here are: 1) The use of \"obviously\" can be seen as belittling, even if unintended. 2) The author's refusal to apologize and dismissive attitude towards her feelings. 3) The girlfriend's valid reaction to feeling hurt and disrespected.\n\nWhile the author might not have had malicious intent, the impact of his words still hurt her. In such cases, it's not just about whether the person was right or wrong in their assessment, but how their words were perceived. The author could have phrased his comment differently to avoid making her feel that way. Additionally, his reaction to her feelings by saying \"I don't care\" exacerbates the problem, as it shows a lack of empathy.\n\nTherefore, even though the author might not have intended to hurt her, his actions and subsequent response contribute to being in the wrong. The key is that in relationships, it's important to consider how one's words and reactions affect their partner, even if the initial intent was neutral.\n"
