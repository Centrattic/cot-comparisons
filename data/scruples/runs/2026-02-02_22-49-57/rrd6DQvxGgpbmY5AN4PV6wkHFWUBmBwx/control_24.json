The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author using the word \"obviously\" when discussing a psychology experiment with his girlfriend. The girlfriend felt hurt because she didn't find it obvious at the time and felt the author was making her feel dumb. The author thinks he's not wrong because the conclusion was indeed obvious and he didn't mean to be snarky.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the dynamics here. The key point is the use of the word \"obviously.\" Even if the author didn't mean to be dismissive, the word itself can come off as condescending. The girlfriend is a psych major, yet she didn't find it obvious when she first learned about it. So the author's assumption that she should have known it was obvious might be incorrect. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt belittled, which is a common emotional response when someone's knowledge or experience isn't acknowledged.\n\nThe author then dismissed her feelings by saying \"I don't care\" and later told her to not get offended by little things. That's where things escalate. Dismissing someone's feelings, even if you don't agree with their perspective, is generally considered invalidating. The author's refusal to apologize and his stance that her feelings shouldn't be hurt shows a lack of empathy. The girlfriend's main issue isn't just the word \"obviously\" but feeling that her experience wasn't respected. \n\nEven though the conclusion might be obvious to someone else, the author should have considered her perspective. The fact that she was learning it in her class suggests she was new to it at the time. The author's assumption that she should have known it was obvious is misplaced. The intent vs. impact argument is tricky, but in relationships, how something is received is as important as the intent. The author's response of invalidating her feelings makes it worse. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's use of \"obviously\" coupled with dismissive responses towards her feelings is problematic. The girlfriend's feelings are valid, and the author should have either phrased his comment differently or acknowledged her perspective without belittling. His refusal to apologize and insistence that she shouldn't be offended shows a lack of consideration for her emotions. Therefore, the author is in the wrong here.\n"
