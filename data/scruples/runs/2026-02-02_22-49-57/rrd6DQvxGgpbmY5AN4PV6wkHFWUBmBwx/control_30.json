The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation.\n\nSo, the author and their girlfriend were discussing a psychology experiment. The author said the conclusion was obvious. The girlfriend felt hurt because the word \"obviously\" made her feel dumb. She's a psych major, but she didn't find it obvious when she first learned it. The author doesn't think they were wrong because the conclusion was obvious, and they assumed the girlfriend would know that as a psych major. The girlfriend keeps explaining why \"obviously\" is offensive, but the author dismisses her feelings by saying \"I don't care\" and later says they don't think the girlfriend should be hurt. The author is refusing to apologize and wants the girlfriend to not get offended over small things.\n\nNow, considering communication in relationships. Using words like \"obviously\" can be condescending, even if not intended that way. The key here is that the girlfriend felt hurt. Even if the author didn't mean to be snarky, the impact of the word matters. The author's response to her feelings by dismissing them (\"I don't care\") and invalidating her hurt feelings is problematic. The author is not taking responsibility for how their words affected her, which is a big red flag. In healthy relationships, it's important to validate each other's feelings even if you don't see things the same way. The author's stance that the girlfriend should just get over it is disrespectful. So, the author is in the wrong because they failed to acknowledge the girlfriend's feelings and showed a lack of empathy.\n"
