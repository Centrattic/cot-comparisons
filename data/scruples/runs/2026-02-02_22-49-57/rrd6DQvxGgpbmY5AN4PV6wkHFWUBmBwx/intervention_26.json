The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who posted the question is in the wrong for using the word \"obviously\" and not apologizing. \n\nFirst, the situation: the author and his girlfriend were discussing a psychology experiment. He found the conclusion obvious and said so, using \"obviously.\" She felt hurt because she didn't see it as obvious when she first learned it, and the word made her feel dumb.\n\nThe key points here are communication styles and emotional impact. The author mentions he didn't intend to be snarky, just stating an obvious conclusion. However, his girlfriend felt offended. Using \"obviously\" can come off as dismissive, even if not meant that way. It's a common issue where people use words that, while not malicious, can still hurt others.\n\nThe author's main argument is that the conclusion really is obvious, and as a psych major, she should have known. But he's dismissing her feelings by saying she shouldn't get offended over little things. He also refuses to apologize, thinking she's overreacting. \n\nFrom a relationship perspective, empathy is crucial. Even if the author didn't mean to hurt her, the effect is what matters. She felt dumb, and he's not validating her feelings. Instead of apologizing, he's trying to explain why she shouldn't feel that way. This can lead to further hurt because it shows a lack of understanding towards her emotional response.\n\nSo, while the author might not have intended to be hurtful, his response in not apologizing and dismissing her feelings makes him at fault. Relationships require both parties to consider each other's feelings, even if they don't fully agree on the validity of those feelings. The fact that he's not willing to acknowledge her hurt feelings and instead insists she should just \"get over it\" is the wrong approach. \n\nTherefore, the correct answer here is A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't take responsibility for his words and invalidated her emotions.\n"
