The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for using the word \"obviously\" with their girlfriend, which hurt her feelings.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author said the experiment's conclusion was obvious, not in a snarky way but just stating their opinion. The girlfriend felt offended because she didn't think it was obvious when she learned it. She felt it made her feel dumb. The author doesn't think they were wrong because they assumed, as a psych major, she should have found it obvious. They even argue that she should just get over it and not take things so personally.\n\nNow, the key points here. The word \"obviously\" can be a trigger for people because it implies that something should be clear to everyone, which might not be the case. Even if the author didn't mean to sound condescending, the impact on the girlfriend's feelings is real. The author dismisses her feelings by saying they don't care, which is a problem because acknowledging feelings is important in a relationship. The author also tries to invalidate her perspective by insisting it should have been obvious to her, which shows a lack of empathy. \n\nEven though the author apologizes for hurting her feelings, they don't seem to take responsibility for their actions, instead blaming the girlfriend for being too sensitive. The fact that the girlfriend is a psych major might mean she understands the nuances, but her personal experience with the experiment matters. The author's stance that she should \"get over it\" is dismissive and indicates a lack of consideration for her emotions.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's failure to see the offensive nature of their words and their dismissive attitude towards the girlfriend's feelings places them in the wrong. They should have been more mindful of how their words could be received and shown more empathy towards her experience. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
