The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author using the word \"obviously\" during a discussion with his girlfriend about a psychology experiment.\n\nFirst, the author's girlfriend is a psych major and mentioned an experiment. He said the conclusion was obvious, which hurt her feelings because she felt it made her feel dumb. She was proud of learning it and didn't realize it was obvious to others. He argues that it was safe to assume she knew, and that he didn't mean to be snarky. He also says he doesn't care that she's upset and doesn't want to apologize, thinking it's a small thing.\n\nNow, I need to determine if the author is wrong. The key points here are about communication and empathy in a relationship. Using words like \"obviously\" can be dismissive, even if not intended as such. The girlfriend felt hurt because she didn't see it as obvious when she first learned it. The author's response of not caring about her feelings and invalidating her reaction by saying she should get over it seems problematic.\n\nEven if the conclusion is indeed obvious, the way he communicated it could be seen as condescending. In relationships, the intention might not matter as much as the impact. The author isn't acknowledging her feelings and is being dismissive. By refusing to apologize and telling her not to get offended over small things, he's not taking responsibility for his part in the conflict.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions, though maybe not malicious, still hurt his girlfriend. He should have been more mindful of his words and her feelings. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
