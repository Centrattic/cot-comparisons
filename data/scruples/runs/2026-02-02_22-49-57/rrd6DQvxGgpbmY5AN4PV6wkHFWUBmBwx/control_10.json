The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is at fault here. The situation is that the author said an experiment's conclusion was obvious to their girlfriend, who's a psych major. She got hurt because the word \"obviously\" made her feel dumb, even though she was excited when she first learned it. The author doesn't think they're wrong because it was actually a well-known concept.\n\nHmm, so the key points are about using the word \"obviously\" in a relationship context. I remember that in communication, using words like \"obviously\" can come off as dismissive or condescending, even if the speaker doesn't mean it that way. The girlfriend felt her feelings were hurt, and the author is defensive, not wanting to apologize because they think it's trivial.\n\nBut wait, even if the conclusion is obvious to the speaker, it might not be to their partner. The author's assumption that she should have found it obvious might be ignoring her perspective. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt belittled. The author's response of \"I don't care\" and invalidating her feelings by saying she should get over it is definitely part of the problem. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to acknowledge each other's feelings. The fact that the author is not willing to apologize, even if unintentionally hurtful, shows a lack of consideration. So even if the author's intention wasn't to be snarky, the impact was negative. The answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong because they dismissed her feelings and failed to empathize.\n"
