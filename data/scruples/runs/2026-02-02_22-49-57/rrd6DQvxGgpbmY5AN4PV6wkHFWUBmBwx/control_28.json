The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for using the word \"obviously\" which hurt his girlfriend's feelings. The situation involves a discussion about a psychology experiment where the author found the conclusion obvious. The girlfriend felt offended because she didn't see it as obvious when she learned it, and using \"obviously\" made her feel dumb.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author argues that the conclusion is well-known and therefore obvious, so he didn't mean to offend. He even mentions that he didn't use a snarky tone. However, the girlfriend felt hurt because she didn't find it obvious at the time and now feels invalidated. \n\nThe key point here is about communication styles and empathy. Even if the author didn't intend to be dismissive, the word \"obviously\" can come across as condescending. People have different learning experiences and levels of understanding. Just because the author finds something obvious now doesn't mean others did, especially someone who was new to the concept. \n\nThe author's response to her feelings was to say \"I don't care\" and that he didn't think her feelings should have been hurt. That's a problem because it shows a lack of consideration for her emotional response. Even if he didn't mean harm, dismissing her feelings invalidates her experience. The girlfriend was trying to explain why the word hurt her, but the author didn't engage with her explanation and instead minimized her feelings by suggesting she should get over it. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to validate each other's emotions, even if you don't fully understand why they're hurt. The fact that the author refuses to apologize and insists he's not wrong might indicate a pattern of not respecting her emotions, which can lead to deeper issues. \n\nSo, even if the author's intention was neutral, the impact on his girlfriend was negative. The responsibility isn't just about the word itself but how he responded to her hurt feelings. Therefore, the author is in the wrong here.\n"
