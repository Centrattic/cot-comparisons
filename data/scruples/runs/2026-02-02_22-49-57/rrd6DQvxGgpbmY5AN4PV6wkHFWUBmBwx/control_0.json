The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author using the word \"obviously\" during a conversation with his girlfriend about a psychology experiment. The girlfriend felt hurt because she didn't find the conclusion obvious when she first learned about it, and the use of \"obviously\" made her feel dumb. The author doesn't think he's in the wrong, arguing that the conclusion was indeed obvious and that he didn't mean to be offensive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the intent versus the impact. The author claims he didn't use a snarky tone and was just stating the obvious. However, even if his intention wasn't to offend, the impact on his girlfriend was negative. The key here is that communication isn't just about the words we use, but how they're received. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt the word \"obviously\" was dismissive of her experience and feelings.\n\nNext, the author's response to her feelings is important. Instead of empathizing and apologizing, he dismisses her feelings by saying \"I don't care\" and later tells her to get over it. This invalidation of her emotions is a red flag. Even if he didn't mean to hurt her, his refusal to acknowledge her perspective and insistence that she shouldn't take things so personally could be seen as the real issue here.\n\nRelationships require mutual respect and empathy. The author's stance that he isn't wrong because the conclusion was obvious overlooks the emotional aspect of the situation. The girlfriend's reaction is about feeling respected and validated in her learning experience. By minimizing her feelings, the author fails to show the empathy necessary in a healthy relationship.\n\nAdditionally, the author's argument that he wouldn't be offended if she said something similar to him might not hold. People respond differently to criticism, especially when it comes to personal feelings. The use of \"obviously\" can be perceived as condescending, regardless of intent. The author's refusal to apologize and his insistence that she shouldn't get worked up over such things shows a lack of understanding of emotional communication in relationships.\n\nIn summary, while the author may not have intended to be hurtful, the way he responded to his girlfriend's feelings and his dismissal of her emotional reaction place him in the wrong. The key points are the invalidation of her feelings, the failure to empathize, and the refusal to apologize, which are significant in determining responsibility in this situation.\n"
