The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for using the word \"obviously\" in a conversation with their girlfriend about a psychology experiment. The girlfriend felt hurt because she thought the word made her feel dumb. The author thinks it was obvious because it's a well-known concept and the girlfriend, being a psych major, should have known that. But she didn't realize it was obvious when she first learned it.\n\nHmm. The author's reasoning is that the conclusion is obvious, so using \"obviously\" wasn't meant to be offensive. They even say they didn't use it in a snarky way. However, the girlfriend feels offended, which the author dismisses by saying they don't care about her feelings in this case and that she shouldn't get worked up over little things. \n\nI remember that sometimes in relationships, the intention vs. impact is a big deal. Even if someone didn't mean to hurt you, the impact is still real. The word \"obviously\" can come off as dismissive. Even if the author meant it neutrally, the girlfriend took it as a personal insult, making her feel stupid. The author's response was to invalidate her feelings by saying they don't care if others are offended, which might have made things worse. \n\nThe key points here are communication and empathy. The author might not see the problem because they think the concept is obvious. But the girlfriend's experience was different; she found it cool when she learned it and didn't realize it was obvious. The author's insistence that it's obvious and that the girlfriend should have known that could be seen as minimizing her feelings. \n\nAlso, when the girlfriend tried to explain why \"obviously\" was offensive, the author didn't listen and instead said they don't care. That shows a lack of effort to understand her perspective. Even if the author believes they're right, how they handled the situation could be the issue. \n\nSo, even if the author's intention wasn't to be rude, the impact on the girlfriend was hurtful. In relationships, it's important to be considerate of each other's feelings. The author might not be in the wrong in terms of using the word, but their response to her hurt feelings definitely contributes to the problem. They should have apologized to show they care, even if they don't fully agree with her reaction. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because they failed to acknowledge and validate their girlfriend's feelings, leading to further conflict instead of resolution.\n"
