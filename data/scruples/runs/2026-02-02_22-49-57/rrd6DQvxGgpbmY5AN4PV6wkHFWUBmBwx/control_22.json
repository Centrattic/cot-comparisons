The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author using the word \"obviously\" when discussing an experiment with his girlfriend, which hurt her feelings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is a psych major, and the experiment's conclusion was something she learned in her class. The author said it was obvious, not in a snarky way, but the girlfriend felt it made her feel dumb. The author thinks she's overreacting and doesn't think he should apologize.\n\nSo, the key points here are communication and empathy. The word \"obviously\" can be dismissive, even if not intended that way. The girlfriend might have felt her intelligence was being questioned, especially if she didn't find it obvious at first. Even though the author didn't mean to be condescending, the impact is what matters here. \n\nThe author's response to her feelings is also important. He dismissed her feelings by saying \"I don't care\" and that she should just get over it. That's a problem because it invalidates her emotions. Even if he didn't mean to hurt her, not acknowledging her feelings and refusing to apologize shows a lack of empathy. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is valid because people process information differently. What's obvious to one person might not be to another, especially in a learning context. The author's assumption that as a psych major she should know it is flawed. It's possible he's underestimating her experience or the difficulty she had when she first learned it.\n\nMoreover, the author's refusal to apologize and his attitude that it's a small thing suggests he's not taking her feelings seriously. This can erode trust and respect in a relationship. Even if he's not malicious, his response exacerbates the issue. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to validate each other's feelings, even if you don't see the problem. The author's approach might be seen as dismissive and not considering her perspective. Therefore, he is in the wrong for not empathizing and for not apologizing, even if the initial word choice wasn't intended to be hurtful.\n"
