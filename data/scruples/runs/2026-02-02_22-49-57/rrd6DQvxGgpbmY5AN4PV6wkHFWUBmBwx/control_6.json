The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author said something was \"obviously\" the case during a conversation with their girlfriend, who's a psychology major. She felt hurt because she didn't realize it was obvious and the use of \"obviously\" made her feel dumb. The author argues that it was obvious and that she should have known, and they don't think they should have to apologize.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the impact of the word \"obviously.\" Even if the author didn't mean it in a snarky way, the word can come off as dismissive. People might take it as implying that the other person is not as smart if they didn't see it. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt hurt and thought she was being made to feel stupid. The author's response to her feelings by not apologizing and saying they don't care about her feelings, even though they later said they do, might have made things worse. \n\nThe key point here is intent versus impact. The author might have had good intentions, but the impact on the girlfriend was negative. In relationships, it's important to acknowledge how your words affect others, even if you didn't mean to hurt them. The author's refusal to apologize and trying to minimize her feelings by saying it's just a small thing could be seen as insensitive. They should probably take responsibility and apologize, even if they don't see it as a big deal themselves. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend mentioned that the conclusion wasn't obvious to her when she first learned about it. The author's assumption that it was obvious because it's a well-known concept might not consider her personal experience. Everyone learns things at different times and might not see things as obvious as someone else does. The author's insistence that it's obvious despite her feelings shows a lack of empathy. \n\nSo, putting this all together, even if the author didn't mean to be rude, the way they handled the situation and dismissed her feelings makes them at fault. They should have been more considerate of how their words might be received and apologized instead of trying to justify their actions.\n"
