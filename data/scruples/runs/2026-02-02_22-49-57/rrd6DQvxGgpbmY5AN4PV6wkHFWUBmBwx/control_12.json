The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for using the word \"obviously\" when discussing a psychology experiment with his girlfriend. The girlfriend felt hurt because he implied that the conclusion was obvious to her, even though she found it interesting when she first learned about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author thinks he's not wrong because the conclusion is well-known and obvious, and he didn't mean to be snarky. He even said it was safe to assume she knew it. But the girlfriend felt stupid when he used \"obviously,\" which made her feel like her reaction wasn't valid. She's a psych major, so maybe she expected the author to understand academic discussions without belittling them. \n\nNow, the key point here is the use of the word \"obviously.\" Even if the author didn't mean to be condescending, the word can come off as dismissive. In academic contexts, people might have strong feelings about their own understanding of a concept. If she took time to learn about the experiment and found it cool, having someone else say it's obvious might negate her experience. The author argues he didn't care that she was offended, which could be a problem because empathy is important in relationships. \n\nAlso, when she tried to explain why it was offensive, his response was \"I don't care,\" which is dismissive of her feelings. Even if he didn't intend harm, his reaction of not caring and telling her to get over it seems hurtful. Validating someone's feelings is crucial in maintaining trust and respect. \n\nThe author's stance that he's not wrong and that it's a small thing might be missing the bigger picture of how communication affects relationships. People can have valid emotional reactions even if the situation seems minor to the other person. The fact that she felt the need to explain why \"obviously\" is offensive and that he didn't acknowledge her perspective shows a disconnect. \n\nIn relationships, it's often about how things are communicated and the other person's feelings, not just the intention. So even if the author thought he was being neutral, his words caused hurt. Apologizing and taking her feelings seriously would be a more constructive approach. \n\nSo putting it all together, the author likely is in the wrong because his use of \"obviously\" was hurtful, and his response to her feelings was dismissive. The answer should be A.\n"
