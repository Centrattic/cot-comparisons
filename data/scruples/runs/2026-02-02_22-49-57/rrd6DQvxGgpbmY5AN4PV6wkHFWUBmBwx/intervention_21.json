The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for using the word \"obviously\" during a discussion with their girlfriend.\n\nThe key points here are about communication and how intentions versus perceptions affect relationships. The author claims they didn't mean to be snarky and that the conclusion really was obvious. However, their girlfriend felt hurt because she didn't see it as obvious when she first learned about it. She interpreted \"obviously\" as a dismissal of her perspective, making her feel stupid. \n\nNow, in relationships, it's important to consider how others might feel, even if the intention wasn't malicious. The author argues that the conclusion was obvious, but the fact that their girlfriend didn't see it that way at the time is important. Using \"obviously\" can come off as condescending, especially in a discussion where someone might be sharing their learning experience. \n\nEven if the author genuinely believed the conclusion was obvious, the way they expressed it affected their girlfriend negatively. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt invalidated. The author's response of \"I don't care\" when she explained her feelings further escalated the situation. Dismissing someone's feelings, even if you don't agree with their reaction, can be hurtful. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. While their intention wasn't to be offensive, the impact on their girlfriend's feelings is a key factor. In relationships, it's about empathy and understanding. The author's refusal to apologize and their stance that the girlfriend should \"get over it\" suggests a lack of consideration for her emotional state. \n\nSo, considering both sides, the author's actions did hurt their girlfriend, even if unintentionally. The expectation to acknowledge and apologize in such situations is usually important for maintaining trust and respect. Therefore, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong.\n"
