The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for using the word \"obviously\" when discussing an experiment with their girlfriend. The user wants a yes or no answer based on the provided scenario.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author mentions that their girlfriend, who is a psych major, told them about an experiment. The conclusion was obvious to the author, so they said it was obvious. The girlfriend felt it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She had found it cool when she first learned about it and didn't see it as obvious. The author argues that the conclusion is well-known and obvious, so they thought it obvious that she would already know it. The girlfriend felt hurt and was upset when the author didn't seem to acknowledge her feelings, leading to conflict.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The key point is the use of the word \"obviously.\" Even if the conclusion is indeed obvious to the author, using that word can come across as dismissive or belittling, especially in a relationship. The girlfriend's feelings being hurt stems from feeling that her experience (finding it cool when she first learned it) was invalidated. The author thinks the girlfriend overreacted, but the problem here is about empathy and communication.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to consider how words affect the other person, even if the intention isn't malicious. The author's response of \"I don't care\" about her feelings when she's upset shows a lack of empathy. Even if the author genuinely didn't mean to hurt her, the impact is still real. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt hurt, and the author's refusal to apologize and dismissive attitude toward her feelings suggests a failure to recognize her perspective.\n\nThe author's justification is that they didn't mean it snarkily and that the conclusion is well-known. However, the girlfriend's experience is different. The word \"obviously\" can minimize someone's effort or experience in learning something. Since she's a psych major, maybe the experiment is part of a more complex topic where the conclusion isn't immediately obvious in context, even if the author sees it as a well-known concept. The author's assumption that she should have found it obvious overlooks the possibility that the learning experience was about the process, not the conclusion itself.\n\nAlso, when the girlfriend tried to explain why the word was offensive, the author's response was dismissive. This invalidation of her feelings likely escalated the conflict. The author's stance that the girlfriend should just get over it is problematic because it ignores her emotional response. In healthy relationships, both parties should validate each other's feelings, even if they don't agree with the reaction.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's use of \"obviously\" was likely hurtful, and their subsequent dismissiveness contributed to the conflict. Even if the conclusion was obvious, the way it was communicated caused harm. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not considering their partner's feelings and for not being empathetic.\n"
