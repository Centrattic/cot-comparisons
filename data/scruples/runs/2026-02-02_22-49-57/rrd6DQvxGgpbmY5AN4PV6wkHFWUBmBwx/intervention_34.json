The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a disagreement between a couple where the author used the word \"obviously\" during a conversation about a psychology experiment. The girlfriend felt hurt and called the word offensive, while the author argues it wasn't meant that way and doesn't think he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key elements here. The main issue is the use of \"obviously\" and its impact. The author claims the conclusion was obvious and that as a psych major, the girlfriend should have known. The girlfriend felt it was dismissive and made her feel dumb. The author then dismisses her feelings by saying \"I don't care\" and suggests she should just get over it.\n\nIn relationships, communication and empathy are crucial. Even if the author didn't intend to be offensive, the effect on the girlfriend was hurtful. Using words like \"obviously\" can come off as condescending, regardless of intent. The author's refusal to apologize and his dismissive attitude (\"I don't care\") show a lack of consideration for her feelings. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt disrespected, and the author's response of trying to invalidate her feelings (by saying she should get over it) exacerbates the problem. \n\nEven if the conclusion was indeed obvious, the way it was communicated matters. The author's assumption that the girlfriend should have known it was obvious undermines her experience of learning it. People can have different perspectives on what's obvious. The key here is emotional support in a relationship. The author's priority seems to be correctness over his partner's emotional well-being, which is a common issue in such scenarios. \n\nConsidering all that, the author's actions, though perhaps not malicious, were dismissive and hurtful. His refusal to acknowledge her feelings and his insistence that it's a small issue show a lack of emotional intelligence. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because he failed to consider his partner's feelings and responded in a way that disregarded her emotional response. The correct answer would be A.\n"
