The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. The situation involves the author saying an experiment's conclusion was obvious, which upset their girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to recall what made the situation hurtful. The author used the word \"obviously,\" which their girlfriend found offensive because she didn't find it obvious at the time. She felt it made her feel dumb. The author argues that the conclusion really is obvious and that as a psych major, she should have known it. But the key here is the perception and the emotional response.\n\nI remember that using words like \"obviously\" can come off as dismissive, even if the speaker doesn't intend to be. The problem isn't necessarily whether the conclusion is actually obvious, but how the delivery affected her. The author seems to be minimizing her feelings by saying he doesn't think her feelings should have been hurt. He also says he doesn't care about her feelings, which is a big red flag.\n\nEven though the author didn't mean to be snarky, the impact is what matters here. The girlfriend felt hurt and invalidated, especially when he dismissed her feelings by saying \"I don't care\" and told her to get over it. That's not empathetic. Apologizing isn't just about admitting fault but showing that you value the other person's feelings. The author's refusal to apologize and insistence that it's not a big deal suggests he's not taking her feelings seriously.\n\nAlso, the fact that she's a psych major doesn't mean she should have found it obvious. Maybe the experiment was presented in a way that wasn't obvious to her at first. The author's assumption that she should have known it was obvious is part of the problem. People process information differently, and what's obvious to one person might not be to another.\n\nSo, putting it all together, even if the conclusion was obvious to the author, the way he expressed it hurt her. His response to her hurt feelings\u2014invalidating them and not apologizing\u2014makes it his fault. The answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
