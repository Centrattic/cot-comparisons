The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author said something was \"obvious\" during a conversation with their girlfriend, who's a psychology major. She got hurt because she felt it made her feel dumb. The author doesn't think they did anything wrong and says they don't think the girlfriend's feelings should have been hurt.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of the girlfriend. She's a psych major, so maybe she was proud of learning about the experiment. When the author called it obvious, even if not intended to be dismissive, it could come off as belittling her experience. Using the word \"obviously\" can sometimes sound condescending, even if you don't mean it. The girlfriend might have felt that her effort to learn and be excited about the experiment was being undermined.\n\nThen, the author's response after the girlfriend expressed her feelings is a big point. The author says, \"I don't care,\" when she's explaining why the word was offensive. That sounds dismissive of her feelings. Even if the author didn't mean to be hurtful, not acknowledging her perspective and invalidating her emotions is a problem. Relationships require empathy and communication. By not apologizing and instead trying to minimize her reaction, the author is being dismissive.\n\nAlso, the author says they don't think the girlfriend should get offended over little things. This might be a problem because if someone's feelings are hurt, even about something that seems small to the other person, it's important to validate their emotions. What's a \"little thing\" to one person might be significant to the other. The author's insistence that it's not a big deal could be seen as not respecting her feelings.\n\nThe key points here are about communication style and empathy. The author used a phrase that can be hurtful, didn't validate their girlfriend's feelings, and refused to apologize. Even if the author genuinely didn't mean to hurt her, the way they responded after the fact is where the issue lies. In relationships, it's important to acknowledge each other's feelings and be willing to apologize when necessary, even if you don't see the problem the same way.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author did say something that could be perceived as dismissive, didn't take the girlfriend's feelings seriously, and refused to apologize. That makes them at least partially at fault. The answer is probably A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
