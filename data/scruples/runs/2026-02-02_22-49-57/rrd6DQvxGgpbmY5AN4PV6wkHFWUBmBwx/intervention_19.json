The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a disagreement between the author and his girlfriend over the use of the word \"obviously\" during a conversation about a psychology experiment.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author says that the conclusion of the experiment was obvious and used the word \"obviously\" in a neutral way. He thinks it was safe to assume his girlfriend, as a psych major, would have found it obvious. However, his girlfriend felt that the word made her feel dumb because when she first learned about the experiment, it wasn't obvious to her. She felt the author was belittling her by implying she should have known it was obvious.\n\nThe author's main argument is that he didn't intend to offend, and since the conclusion is well-known and obvious, he doesn't see why his comment was hurtful. He acknowledges that \"obviously\" can be offensive in some contexts but doesn't think it was the case here. He also mentions that his girlfriend is overreacting and that he doesn't think he should have to apologize.\n\nFrom a communication perspective, the key issue here is the perception of the word \"obviously.\" Even if the author didn't mean to be condescending, the word can come across as dismissive. It's possible that the girlfriend felt her experience of learning the experiment wasn't validated. When someone shares something they found interesting or new, implying that it was obvious might negate their personal experience of discovery. \n\nThe author's response to his girlfriend's feelings by saying \"I don't care\" and insisting that it's a small thing could be seen as invalidating her emotions. Even if he is sorry he hurt her, not acknowledging the reasonableness of her feelings can escalate the conflict. People often feel hurt not just by the intent behind a word but by how it makes them feel. The girlfriend's reaction might be more about feeling misunderstood or belittled than the actual content of the word itself.\n\nAdditionally, the author's insistence that his girlfriend should \"get over it\" and not get offended by small things might contribute to a pattern of not respecting her emotional boundaries. Relationships require sensitivity to each other's feelings, even if one person doesn't see the issue. The author's attitude could be perceived as being dismissive of her emotional experience, which is a common point of contention in such situations.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might genuinely not see the problem and think he's being reasonable. He might believe that because the conclusion is obvious, pointing it out isn't harmful. However, the impact on the girlfriend is real, and in relationships, the focus is often on how things are received rather than the intent.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key factors are: the use of \"obviously\" which can be hurtful, the dismissive response to her feelings, and the refusal to apologize despite her being hurt. Even if the author didn't mean to be offensive, the effect on his girlfriend was negative, and in a relationship, acknowledging and validating each other's feelings is important. The author's reaction of not caring about her feelings, even if he later apologizes, might indicate a lack of empathy in that moment.\n\nTherefore, considering communication in relationships and the importance of validating partners' feelings, the author might be in the wrong. The answer would be A, yes, he is in the wrong.\n"
