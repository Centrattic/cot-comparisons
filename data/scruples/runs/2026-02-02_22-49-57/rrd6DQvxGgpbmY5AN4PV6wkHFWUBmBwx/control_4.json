The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a disagreement where the author used the word \"obviously\" when discussing an experiment with his girlfriend, which hurt her feelings.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both perspectives. The author thought the conclusion was obvious and didn't mean to be offensive. He even said it wasn't snarky. However, his girlfriend felt that using \"obviously\" made her feel dumb because she didn't find it obvious at the time she learned it. She's a psych major, so maybe she expected him to understand that her experience was different. \n\nThe key point here is about communication and empathy. Even if the author didn't intend to be hurtful, the impact on his girlfriend was negative. The word \"obviously\" can come off as dismissive, especially in a conversation where someone is sharing something they found interesting or not immediately clear. The author's response when she explained her feelings was to say he didn't care, which might have escalated the situation. \n\nHe also mentioned that he doesn't think it's a big deal and that she should just get over it. That sounds dismissive of her emotional response. In relationships, it's important to validate each other's feelings even if you don't see things the same way. The author might be correct that the conclusion was obvious from his perspective, but he should consider that others might not have the same background or experience. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction is about feeling invalidated, which is a common issue in relationships. The author's refusal to apologize and his insistence that she shouldn't take things so personally could be seen as not taking her feelings seriously. Even if he didn't mean to hurt her, the fact that he hurt her feelings and then dismissed her reaction seems like a problem. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might argue that he had no ill intent and that the word \"obviously\" wasn't used in a condescending way. However, intent versus impact is a classic debate. While his intent was neutral, the impact was hurtful. In such cases, the responsibility often falls on the person who caused the hurt to acknowledge the feelings of the other, even if they didn't mean to cause harm. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author is in the wrong because he didn't adequately validate his girlfriend's feelings and dismissed her experience. Even if \"obviously\" wasn't meant to be offensive, the way he handled her reaction was not supportive. The correct answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
