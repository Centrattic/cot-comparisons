The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for hurting their girlfriend's feelings by using the word \"obviously\" when discussing a psychology experiment. The girlfriend felt offended, saying it made her feel dumb. The author thinks it was obvious, especially since she's a psych major, and doesn't think an apology is needed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is a psych major, so maybe she expected to know the experiment's conclusion. However, just because she's a psych major doesn't mean she knows every study. Even experts might learn new things. The author's use of \"obviously\" could come off as dismissive. The girlfriend felt her reaction was valid because she didn't see it as obvious when she first learned it. The author's response of not caring about her feelings might be the bigger issue here. People can have different sensitivities. Even if the author didn't intend to be snarky, the word choice had a negative impact. The argument is about perspective: the author's intent versus the girlfriend's feelings. In relationships, validating each other's emotions is important. By dismissing her feelings as a \"big thing,\" the author might be in the wrong. So maybe the answer is A.\n"
