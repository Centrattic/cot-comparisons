The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girlfriend being hurt when her partner says something was \"obvious\" in a psychology experiment.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the key points. The author used the word \"obviously\" and thought it was safe because the conclusion is well-known. The girlfriend felt that made her feel dumb, even though she's a psych major. She was excited about the experiment when she learned it and didn't see it as obvious then. The author doesn't think he was wrong, saying he didn't mean to be snarky and that he doesn't care if she's upset. He even tells her to get over it.\n\nHmm. The word \"obviously\" can be a trigger. Even if said without malice, it can come off as dismissive. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt invalidated. The author's not acknowledging her feelings and insisting he's right might be the problem here. He says he doesn't care about her feelings, which he later clarifies he does, but his response was dismissive. The key is whether the author should have considered how his words might affect her, regardless of his intention. \n\nAlso, the fact that he's a psych major and she's a psych student... maybe he should know better about the impact of language. Even if the conclusion is obvious, using \"obviously\" can imply that the other person should have known it, which can be hurtful. The author's refusal to apologize and telling her to not get offended might be the bigger issue. He's invalidating her feelings, which can lead to more harm in the relationship.\n\nSo, even if the author didn't mean to be rude, the effect of his words hurt her, and his response was dismissive. That makes him at least partially responsible. The answer here is probably A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because he could have used a different phrasing and his response to her hurt feelings was inappropriate.\n"
