The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for using the word \"obviously\" when discussing a psychology experiment with his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend was sharing something from her class. The author thought the conclusion was obvious and said so. The girlfriend felt hurt because \"obviously\" made her feel dumb. Even though the conclusion is well-known in psychology, the key issue here is the communication and how it affected her.\n\nThe author's intention wasn't to be snarky, but he dismissed her feelings by saying \"I don't care\" and later told her to not get offended over little things. That's problematic because validating someone's feelings is important in relationships. Even if he didn't mean to, using \"obviously\" can come off as condescending. People take things personally, especially when they're trying to share something they found interesting.\n\nHe also didn't consider that she might have learned the experiment in a context where the conclusion wasn't obvious to her at first. As her partner, acknowledging her perspective and apologizing would have been better. By not apologizing and insisting it's a small issue, he's not taking her feelings seriously. \n\nIn relationships, it's about empathy and respect. The fact that he's unwilling to apologize and instead wants her to \"get over it\" shows a lack of emotional consideration. Even if the conclusion is obvious to him, the way he expressed it and his reaction to her hurt feelings are where he's wrong. So, the answer is A.\n"
