The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author saying an experiment's conclusion was obvious, which upset his girlfriend because she felt it made her feel dumb.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their conversation. The girlfriend is a psych major, so she might take pride in learning new concepts. When the author dismissed the experiment's conclusion as obvious, he might have unintentionally invalidated her experience of finding it cool when she first learned it. Even if the conclusion is indeed obvious, using \"obviously\" can come off as condescending.\n\nThe key points here are the use of the word \"obviously\" and the author's subsequent dismissal of his girlfriend's feelings. The girlfriend felt hurt because she didn't find it obvious at first, and the author's response didn't acknowledge her perspective. The author argues that it was safe to assume it was obvious to her, but that's a flawed assumption because everyone's experience with learning differs. \n\nAlso, when the girlfriend tried to explain why \"obviously\" was offensive, the author responded with \"I don't care,\" which is a clear invalidation of her feelings. This lack of empathy is problematic. The girlfriend's reaction is about feeling disrespected, while the author's stance is about not seeing the issue. In relationships, communication and empathy are crucial. Dismissing someone's feelings, even unintentionally, can be hurtful. \n\nThe author's refusal to apologize and his insistence that she should \"get over it\" suggests he's not taking her feelings seriously. Even if the conclusion was obvious, the way he communicated it and his subsequent response were hurtful. The fact that he acknowledges hurting her feelings but still doesn't think he's wrong indicates a disconnect in understanding her perspective.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the author's actions, while perhaps not meant to be hurtful, were careless in how they affected his girlfriend. The use of \"obviously\" without considering her feelings, plus not validating her response, makes him at fault. Therefore, the answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
