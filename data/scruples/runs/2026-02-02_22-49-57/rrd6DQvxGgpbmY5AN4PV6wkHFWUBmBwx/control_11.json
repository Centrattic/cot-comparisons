The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for using the word \"obviously\" in a conversation with his girlfriend. \n\nFirst, the context: The girlfriend mentioned an experiment from her psych class. The author found the conclusion obvious and said so. The girlfriend felt hurt because the word \"obviously\" made her feel dumb. Even though the experiment's conclusion is well-known, the girlfriend didn't find it obvious when she first learned it.\n\nSo, the key points here are about communication and emotional impact. The author didn't mean to be dismissive, but the word choice had a negative effect. Even if the conclusion was obvious to him, using \"obviously\" might come across as belittling. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt her experience was invalidated. \n\nThe author's response to her feelings\u2014saying he doesn't care and thinking it's a small issue\u2014shows a lack of empathy. Even if he didn't intend harm, he should acknowledge her feelings. Relationships require considering each other's perspectives. The author's insistence on not apologizing and telling her to \"get over it\" is problematic. \n\nIn terms of communication styles, some people are more sensitive to perceived condescension. The use of \"obviously\" can imply that the other person is wrong or uninformed, which is hurtful. The author's failure to see the issue and his dismissive attitude likely worsened the situation. \n\nSo, even if the conclusion was obvious, the way he expressed it and his subsequent reaction to her feelings made him at fault. He should have used a more considerate approach and apologized for hurting her feelings. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
