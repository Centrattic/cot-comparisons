The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for hurting their girlfriend's feelings by using the word \"obviously\" in a conversation about a psychology experiment. The key points here are the use of the word \"obviously\" and the resulting emotional response from the girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is a psych major, so the conclusion they were discussing is a well-known concept. The author thought it was obvious and said so. The girlfriend felt that using \"obviously\" made her feel dumb, even though she's a psych major. The author argues that it's safe to assume she would know it, but the girlfriend didn't realize it was obvious when she first learned it.\n\nNow, the main issue is whether the author is in the wrong. The use of \"obviously\" can be seen as dismissive, even if not intended that way. The author might not have meant to be condescending, but the girlfriend felt hurt. The author's response was to not apologize, thinking it's not a big deal, and even telling the girlfriend to not get offended over small things.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Even if the author didn't mean to be rude, the fact that the girlfriend felt hurt is important. The author's validation of the girlfriend's feelings is necessary here. By saying \"I don't care\" when she explained her hurt feelings, the author is dismissing her emotions, which is a problem. The author should acknowledge her feelings even if they don't see the issue themselves. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because the word made her feel stupid, and the author's refusal to apologize or consider her perspective could lead to further issues in the relationship.\n\nSo, even if the author didn't intend to be offensive, the impact on the girlfriend is what matters. The author's insistence that it's not a big deal and their dismissive attitude toward her feelings puts them in the wrong. The correct answer is A.\n"
