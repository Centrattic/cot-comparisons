The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong after using the word \"obviously\" during a conversation with his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend, a psych major, talked about an experiment she learned in class. The author found the conclusion obvious and said so. The girlfriend felt offended because she didn't consider it obvious when she first learned it. She felt the word \"obviously\" made her feel dumb. The author is defending his use of the word, saying he didn't mean to be snarky and that it was indeed obvious, so she should have known. He even went as far as saying he doesn't care about her feelings on this and that she should get over it.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLet me break it down. The key here is about communication and how words can affect others. The author's intention was to state that the conclusion was obvious, but the girlfriend's reaction was hurt feelings. The author is dismissing her feelings, saying he doesn't think he's wrong. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to consider the other person's feelings, even if the intention wasn't malicious. Using words like \"obviously\" can come off as condescending, even if not intended that way. The girlfriend might feel that being a psych major, she should have known it was obvious, but she didn't. The author's use of \"obviously\" could be seen as minimizing her experience of learning the experiment for the first time. \n\nAlso, the author's response after the hurt feelings was to say he doesn't care and that she should just get over it. That's a red flag because it shows a lack of empathy. Even if he didn't mean to offend, the way he's handling her feelings is dismissive. \n\nIn many cases, the person is in the wrong if they dismiss someone's feelings, even if they didn't mean to cause harm. The girlfriend is valid in feeling hurt, and the author's refusal to acknowledge or apologize for that is problematic. \n\nSo, putting it together: Using \"obviously\" in a way that makes someone feel dumb, especially a partner, can be hurtful. The author's response of not caring about her feelings and telling her to get over it is definitely on the wrong side. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
