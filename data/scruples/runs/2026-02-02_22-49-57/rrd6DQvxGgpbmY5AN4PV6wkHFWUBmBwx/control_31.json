The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is at fault for hurting his girlfriend's feelings by using the word \"obviously\" during their conversation about a psychology experiment.\n\nFirst, the context: The girlfriend is a psych major and mentioned an experiment. The author thought the conclusion was obvious and said so. The girlfriend felt offended because he used \"obviously,\" making her feel dumb. The author argues that it was obvious and that he didn't mean to be snarky, and he doesn't think he should apologize.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author's intention is important. He says he didn't use a snarky tone and just stated that the conclusion was obvious. However, intentions don't always override the impact. The girlfriend's feelings were hurt, and she felt invalidated. Even if the conclusion is indeed well-known, the way it's communicated matters. Using \"obviously\" can come off as dismissive, implying that the listener should have known it, which can be hurtful.\n\nThe author also mentions that he doesn't care about her feelings in this context, even though he acknowledges he hurt them. This could be a problem because respecting each other's feelings is crucial in a relationship. The girlfriend's reaction is valid; she was proud of learning something new, and his comment undermined her experience. The author's response of not caring about her feelings and insisting it's not a big deal might be seen as not taking responsibility for his actions, which can damage trust and emotional connection.\n\nMoreover, the author tries to minimize her reaction by saying she should just get over it and not take things so personally. That's not a good approach. Instead of dismissing her feelings, he should validate them, even if he disagrees. Relationships require both parties to consider each other's perspectives and emotional needs. The fact that he's unwilling to apologize despite her hurt feelings suggests he's not prioritizing her emotional well-being, which is a red flag.\n\nIn summary, while the author might not have intended to be hurtful, his words did cause emotional harm. The key issue is his response to her feelings\u2014invalidating them instead of apologizing and trying to understand. That makes him at fault.\n"
