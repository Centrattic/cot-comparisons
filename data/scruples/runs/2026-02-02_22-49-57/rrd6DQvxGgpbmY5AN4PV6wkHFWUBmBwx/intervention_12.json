The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's girlfriend was talking about a psychology experiment she learned about in her class. The author responded by saying the conclusion was obvious. The girlfriend took offense to the word \"obviously\" because it made her feel dumb. The author thinks he's not in the wrong because the conclusion really is obvious and he didn't mean to be dismissive.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the use of the word \"obviously.\" In many contexts, using \"obvious\" can come off as condescending, even if not intended. The girlfriend is a psychology major, so maybe she expected the author to understand that she knew the material but just didn't find it obvious at first. The author's comment might have implied that she was wrong for not seeing it right away, which could hurt her feelings. \n\nThe author says he didn't mean it in a snarky way, but the key here is whether the intention matters. Even if he didn't mean to insult her, the effect on her feelings is real. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt hurt. The author's response of \"I don't care\" when she explained her feelings is problematic because it shows a lack of empathy. Dismissing her feelings as overreacting isn't helpful in resolving the conflict.\n\nAlso, the author is in a relationship where communication and mutual respect are important. Even if the conclusion was obvious, the way he expressed his opinion might have been dismissive of her experience. The girlfriend might have felt that her experience of learning something new was invalidated. The author's insistence that she should just get over it further exacerbates the issue because it doesn't validate her feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might believe that the conclusion was indeed common knowledge in psychology, so his comment wasn't meant to belittle her. However, in relationships, it's about how the other person feels, not just the literal meaning. The fact that the girlfriend felt hurt indicates that the author's words had a negative impact, regardless of intent.\n\nSo, considering both perspectives, the author did say something that hurt her feelings, even if unintentionally. The way he responded by not caring and telling her to get over it is where he's more clearly in the wrong. Therefore, he should probably take some responsibility and apologize, even if he doesn't see it as a big issue. The answer would be A, meaning the author is in the wrong because his response was dismissive and invalidated her feelings, leading to hurt.\n"
