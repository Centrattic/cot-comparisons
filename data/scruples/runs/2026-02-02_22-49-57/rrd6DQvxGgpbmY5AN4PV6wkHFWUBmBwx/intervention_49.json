The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a disagreement between the author and his girlfriend over using the word \"obviously\" during a conversation about a psychology experiment's conclusion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author said the experiment's conclusion was obvious, thinking his girlfriend, a psych major, would know it. His girlfriend felt that using \"obviously\" made her feel dumb because she didn't find it obvious when she first learned it. The author is defensive, saying he doesn't think her feelings were hurt and he doesn't care, which led to more conflict.\n\nNow, considering social norms and communication in relationships. Using \"obviously\" can come off as dismissive, even if unintended. It's common in AITA scenarios for the person to think they're right, but sometimes the impact matters more than the intent. The girlfriend felt hurt, and the author's response of \"I don't care\" about her feelings is problematic. Even if he later apologized, his initial defensiveness and insistence that her feelings shouldn't be hurt might indicate a lack of empathy.\n\nAlso, the author's argument that since it's a well-known concept and she's a psych major, she should have found it obvious, might be minimizing her experience. People can find things obvious or not based on their prior knowledge and how they learned it. Just because it's a well-known concept now doesn't mean it was obvious to her when she first encountered it.\n\nThe key here is whether the author was dismissive of her feelings. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt belittled. The author's refusal to apologize and his insistence that she shouldn't get worked up about it shows he's not prioritizing her emotional experience. In relationships, acknowledging each other's feelings is important, even if the person doesn't see the issue. The author's approach of invalidating her feelings by saying \"I don't care\" is likely wrong, even if he later expressed regret.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong for using a word that made his girlfriend feel bad and then not respecting her feelings by being dismissive. The answer should be A.\n"
