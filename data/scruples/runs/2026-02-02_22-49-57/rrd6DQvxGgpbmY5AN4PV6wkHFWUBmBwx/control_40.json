The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves a disagreement between a couple where the guy used the word \"obviously\" in a conversation about a psychology experiment.\n\nFirst, the guy says the conclusion of the experiment was obvious, which he probably meant as a neutral statement. But his girlfriend took offense because she felt that term was dismissive. She explained that she found the experiment cool when she first learned it and didn't see it as obvious, so his comment made her feel dumb. She's a psych major, so maybe she expected him to be more considerate of her perspective. \n\nThe author argues that the conclusion really is obvious and that he assumed she would know that. He also mentions that he doesn't think it's a big deal and even says \"I don't care\" when she explains her feelings. He refuses to apologize because he doesn't think her feelings were valid. \n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. In relationships, communication and empathy are key. Even if someone doesn't intend to hurt, if their words make their partner feel disrespected, it's important to acknowledge that. Using \"obviously\" can be seen as belittling, regardless of intent. The fact that he dismissed her feelings by not caring is a red flag. He should have apologized to show empathy, even if he didn't agree with her perspective. \n\nAlso, the author's statement that she should \"just get over it\" is problematic. It's not about the magnitude of the issue but about respecting each other's feelings. Even small things can be significant in a relationship if they affect emotional well-being. So, the guy is in the wrong for not validating her feelings and refusing to apologize. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
