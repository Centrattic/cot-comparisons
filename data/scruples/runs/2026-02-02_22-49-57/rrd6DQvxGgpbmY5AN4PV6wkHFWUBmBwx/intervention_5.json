The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves a disagreement between the author and his girlfriend over the use of the word \"obviously\" during a discussion about a psychological experiment.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is a psychology major, and the experiment's conclusion seems obvious to the author. He uses \"obviously\" in response, which makes her feel hurt and dumb. She explains that when she first learned about it, it wasn't obvious to her, so his comment made her feel like he was belittling her experience.\n\nThe key points here are the intention behind the word and the impact it had. The author claims he used \"obviously\" without any snark, just stating his opinion that the conclusion was obvious. However, the girlfriend felt offended, which is a common reaction when someone uses \"obviously\" because it can come off as dismissive. Even if the author didn't intend to offend, the effect on her feelings is still valid.\n\nCommunication in relationships often hinges on empathy and understanding. Even if the author believes he's right, dismissing her feelings as being over-sensitive could be seen as invalidating her emotions. The girlfriend's perspective is that she was proud of learning the concept and felt the author undermined her experience. The author's response of \"I don't care\" and telling her to not get offended about little things suggests a lack of empathy, which can damage the relationship.\n\nThe author's stance is that he's not in the wrong because he didn't mean to hurt her, but in relationships, the impact matters as much as intention. The fact that he refused to apologize and dismissed her feelings might make others see him as in the wrong. However, some might argue that he didn't have malicious intent, so it's a minor issue.\n\nConsidering common advice in such AITA scenarios, showing empathy and taking the other person's feelings seriously is usually recommended. The author's refusal to acknowledge her hurt feelings, even if he didn't mean to, might lead to the conclusion that he is in the wrong (A). But there's a counter-argument that it's a minor issue without malice, so he's not in the wrong (B). I need to weigh the empathy and relationship dynamics here. Typically, in such cases, the person who dismisses another's feelings is seen as the asshole, so leaning towards A.\n"
