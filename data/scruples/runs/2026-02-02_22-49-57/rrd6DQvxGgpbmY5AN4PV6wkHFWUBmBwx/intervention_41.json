The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about using the word \"obviously\" in a discussion with their girlfriend, who is a psychology major. The author says they just stated that the conclusion was obvious, not in a snarky way, and that they assumed as a psych major, their girlfriend would find it obvious too. The girlfriend felt hurt because the use of \"obviously\" made her feel dumb, even though she found it cool when she first learned it. The author doesn't think they should apologize, arguing that they didn't mean to be offensive and that the conclusion really was obvious.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about communication and sensitivity. The word \"obviously\" can come off as dismissive, even if not intended that way. The girlfriend felt her feelings were hurt because she associated the word with being belittled. The author might have good intentions, but the impact is that their girlfriend feels disrespected. The author's stance is that since the conclusion was indeed obvious, and they didn't mean any harm, they don't think they're at fault. However, in relationships, intent vs. impact matters a lot. Even if the intent was neutral, the impact was negative. The author's refusal to apologize and dismissing her feelings (\"I don't care\") might be worse. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt invalidated when her feelings were dismissed. So, the author is in the wrong because they hurt her feelings and didn't acknowledge her perspective, even if they didn't mean to. They should have been more considerate of how their words might be received.\n"
