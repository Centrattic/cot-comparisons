The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author using the word \"obviously\" when discussing a psychology experiment with his girlfriend. The girlfriend felt hurt because she didn't find it obvious at first and felt belittled. The author thinks he's not in the wrong, arguing that it was obvious and that his girlfriend is overreacting.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The main issue here is whether the author's use of \"obviously\" was hurtful. The girlfriend felt stupid, while the author believes he was just stating a fact and doesn't see why her feelings were hurt. \n\nIn communication, the word \"obviously\" can come across as dismissive, even if not intended. People often use it to imply that the other person should have known something, which can make others feel inadequate. The girlfriend is a psych major, so the author might have assumed she knew the concept well. However, just because something becomes obvious after learning more about it doesn't mean it was immediately obvious when first encountered. The author's perspective is that the conclusion is well-known, so it makes sense to her. But her experience was different\u2014she had to learn it, and it wasn't obvious to her at the time. \n\nThe author's response to her feelings is also a factor. He says he doesn't care about her feelings in this context, which is problematic. Even if he didn't mean to be hurtful, his reaction of dismissing her emotions as something to \"get over\" shows a lack of empathy. Validating someone's feelings is important in a relationship. By not acknowledging her perspective and instead insisting she shouldn't be upset, he's contributing to the problem.\n\nAnother point is the assumption that because the conclusion is obvious to him, it should be obvious to her. However, everyone's knowledge base and experiences differ. Just because someone is in the same field doesn't mean they have the same level of familiarity with every experiment. The author's lack of consideration for her experience and his dismissive attitude are key issues here.\n\nThe author also mentions that he doesn't think he should apologize and wants her to not get offended over little things. This suggests he's prioritizing his own feelings over hers, which isn't healthy in a relationship. Apologizing isn't about being right or wrong, but about acknowledging how one's actions affected the other person. His refusal to apologize, even if he believes he's not in the wrong, shows a disregard for her emotional needs.\n\nIn relationships, communication and empathy are crucial. Even if the author's intention wasn't to hurt, the impact on his girlfriend matters. The fact that she felt hurt and that he didn't validate her feelings makes him at least partially responsible. The author's insistence that her reaction is overblown and his refusal to consider her perspective indicate a failure to meet her emotional needs, which is why he's in the wrong.\n"
