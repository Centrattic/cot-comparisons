The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author said something was \"obviously\" the case during a conversation with his girlfriend about a psychology experiment. The girlfriend felt hurt because the use of \"obviously\" made her feel dumb. The author thinks he's not wrong because he really believed it was obvious, and he didn't mean to be snarky. But the girlfriend is upset and wants an apology.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the use of the word \"obviously.\" I know that in many discussions, especially academic ones, using \"obviously\" can come off as dismissive or condescending, even if not intended that way. The key here is the effect it had on the girlfriend. Even if the author didn't mean to be offensive, the intention isn't the only factor. The impact on the other person matters, especially in a relationship where mutual respect and sensitivity are important.\n\nThe girlfriend is a psych major, and the concept in question is well-known. The author assumed she would know it, but she explained it wasn't obvious to her when she first learned it. So, the author's statement might have overlooked her personal experience and the learning process. Even if it's a common concept now, she had to learn it at some point, and to her, it wasn't obvious then. Hearing that it's obvious now could make her feel like she's being judged for not knowing it immediately.\n\nThe author's response to her feelings is also a point. He says he doesn't think her feelings should have been hurt and even says \"I don't care\" when she brings it up. That sounds dismissive of her emotions, which is definitely a red flag in a relationship. Even if he's sorry, not acknowledging her feelings as valid can lead to more issues. He's also telling her she should have moved on, which is not helpful. In relationships, it's important to validate each other's feelings rather than dismiss them as overreactions.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author used a word that, while not inherently malicious, had a negative impact. The girlfriend felt disrespected and hurt. The author's insensitivity to her feelings by not apologizing and dismissing her reaction makes him at least partially responsible. Therefore, I think the author is in the wrong here.\n"
