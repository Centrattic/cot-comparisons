The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author saying something was \"obvious\" during a conversation with his girlfriend, which she took as an insult. He argues that he didn't mean it that way and that the concept really is obvious, so he didn't think it was a big deal. She felt hurt and asked for an apology, but he refuses, thinking she's overreacting.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider both sides. The author's intention was probably not to be dismissive, but using \"obviously\" can come off as condescending. Even if the conclusion is a well-known concept, the way it's phrased matters. The girlfriend is a psych major, so maybe she expected to know it, but maybe she didn't. The key here is about how the other person feels. Even if the author didn't mean to hurt her, the impact of his words is significant. \n\nIn relationships, validation of each other's feelings is important. The author dismisses her feelings by not apologizing and saying she should get over it. That could be seen as not respecting her emotions. Even if he thinks she's overreacting, it's about empathy. If he truly cares, he should acknowledge her feelings regardless of his own perspective. \n\nThe author's stance is that he's not in the wrong because the context makes it clear the conclusion was obvious. But the problem is that the word itself, \"obviously,\" can be inherently hurtful. People might not realize that their words, even if they're factually accurate, can still cause hurt. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt belittled. \n\nAlso, the author's response after the fact\u2014telling her she shouldn't get offended by little things\u2014might be coming from a place of trying to avoid conflict, but it's not taking her feelings into account. The fact that she's asking for an apology suggests that she's hurt and needs reassurance. The author's refusal to apologize could be seen as not valuing her emotions, which is a red flag in a relationship. \n\nSo, even if the author didn't intend to be hurtful, the impact matters. The answer here would lean towards the author being in the wrong because he didn't acknowledge her feelings and instead invalidated them, which can erode trust and respect in a relationship. The correct choice would be A.\n"
