The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about using the word \"obviously\" when discussing a psychology experiment with his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author says they didn't mean to be snarky and just stated that the conclusion was obvious. The girlfriend felt hurt because she didn't know it was obvious when she first learned it. She found the word offensive. The author thinks it's not a big deal and doesn't care if his girlfriend is offended, even though he apologizes. He even says she should just get over it.\n\nHmm. Communication issues often come down to intent vs. impact. The author might not have intended to offend, but the impact was real. The girlfriend felt stupid, which is a valid emotional response. The key here is whether the author should have been more considerate of her feelings, regardless of his intent. \n\nThe author also dismisses her feelings by saying it was safe to assume it was obvious to her. That's a problem because everyone processes information differently. Just because it's well-known to him doesn't mean it was obvious to her at the time. The word \"obviously\" can come off as dismissive, even if not meant to be.\n\nHe also says he doesn't care about her feelings here, which is a red flag. Even if he cares about her in general, invalidating her feelings in this situation is hurtful. Relationships require empathy and validation. By not apologizing and pushing her to get over it, he's not taking her feelings seriously. \n\nSo even though he didn't mean to be rude, the way he responded after she expressed her hurt feelings makes him at fault. He should have acknowledged her feelings instead of dismissing them. The answer is A; he's in the wrong.\n"
