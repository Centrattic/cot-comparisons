The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about using the word \"obviously\" during a conversation with their girlfriend. The girlfriend felt hurt because the word made her feel dumb. The author thinks they're not in the wrong because they didn't mean to be snarky and the conclusion was obvious.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author might believe that since the conclusion was obvious to them, it's reasonable to state that without considering the other person's feelings. But the girlfriend felt offended. The key here is whether the use of \"obviously\" was dismissive, even if not intended that way.\n\nCommunication in relationships often involves more than just the words themselves. Even if spoken neutrally, \"obviously\" can come off as condescending. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt invalidated. The author's refusal to apologize and dismissing her feelings as overreacting might be problematic. \n\nThe girlfriend mentioned that when she first learned about the experiment, it wasn't obvious to her. The author's assumption that it should have been obvious to someone in her field could be the issue. Assuming someone's knowledge level can be hurtful, especially if they didn't perceive it that way initially.\n\nAlso, the author's response to her explanation was \"I don't care,\" which shows a lack of empathy. Even if the author didn't intend to hurt, the fact that they didn't validate her feelings and instead tried to invalidate them by saying it's not a big deal probably made things worse. \n\nIn relationships, empathy is crucial. Acknowledging how the other person feels, even if you don't agree, is important. The author's stance that the girlfriend should \"get over it\" and not be offended by small things is dismissive and could damage the relationship. \n\nSo, putting it all together, even if the author didn't mean to be offensive, the impact on the girlfriend was real. The author's failure to recognize her feelings and their dismissive attitude towards her reaction likely means they are in the wrong. The correct answer is A.\n"
