The conclusion of the experiment seemed pretty obvious to me, so I told her that it was obvious. Not in a snarky way or anything, I just said something like \u201cthat\u2019s obviously the case, what other outcome would it have been\u201d\n\nWe continued the discussion, but a couple minutes later, she told me that she didn\u2019t like that I\u2019d used the word \u201cobviously\u201d because it was offensive and made her feel dumb. She said she thought it was really cool when she learned about it and didn\u2019t know it was obvious. \n\nThe conclusion we were talking about is a well-known concept. It really is obvious, and I told her that as a psych major, I assumed it would have been obvious to her too. \n\nShe said again that she didn\u2019t know it was that obvious, and it hadn\u2019t been obvious to her when she first learned about it, so me saying it was obvious made her feel stupid and hurt her feelings. I know that using the word \u201cobviously\u201d can be offensive, but I don\u2019t think it was this time. It was pretty safe to assume it was obvious to her too. \n\nShe kept trying to explain to me why using the word \u201cobviously\u201d was offensive and that many people would be offended too. I just said \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d She accused me of not caring about her feelings, which I do, and I am sorry I hurt her feelings, but I just don\u2019t think her feelings should have been hurt to begin with.\n\nShe\u2019s waiting for me to apologize, but I don\u2019t think I should have to. I just don\u2019t think this had to be a big thing. I wouldn\u2019t be offended if she said something similar to me. She said that she only started getting worked up when I \u201ctried to invalidate her feelings,\u201d which I guess is true, but she should have just gotten over it anyway. \n\nI told her I need her to not get offended about such little things. \n\nAITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author used the word \"obviously\" when discussing a psychology experiment with his girlfriend, and she felt hurt because it made her feel dumb. The author doesn't think he was wrong and is asking for opinions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend is a psych major, so the experiment being obvious might be a common knowledge in her field. However, the author's use of \"obviously\" might have come off as dismissive. Even if the conclusion is obvious to him, she might have found it challenging when she first learned it. The problem is that the word \"obviously\" can imply that the other person should already know it, which can be condescending, regardless of intent.\n\nThe author argues that it was safe to assume she knew it was obvious. But the key here is that she didn't feel that way. The intention versus the impact is a common point of contention in relationships. Even if he didn't mean to be snarky, the effect was hurtful. The girlfriend is expressing that her feelings were hurt, and she's asking for an apology. The author's response of not caring and telling her to get over it is problematic because it dismisses her feelings rather than validating them.\n\nIn relationships, communication is about how both parties feel. Even if the author doesn't see it as a big deal, the fact that it hurt her feelings is significant. The author's refusal to apologize and his insistence that it was a small thing could indicate a lack of empathy or understanding. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because people process things differently, and what's obvious to one person might not be to another, especially in a learning context. So, the author might be in the wrong for not acknowledging her feelings and for the dismissive response. Therefore, the answer would be A.\n"
