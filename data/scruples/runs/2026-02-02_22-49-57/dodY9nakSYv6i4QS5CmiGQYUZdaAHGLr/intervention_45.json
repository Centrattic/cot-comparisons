      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the parent is in the wrong for not giving their 14-year-old son the X-Box gift card. The context is that the son is failing math because he's spending all his time on Fortnite instead of doing homework. Other grades are also dropping because of zeros on homework.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the parent's action is justified. The parent is withholding a privilege (the gift card) to encourage academic responsibility. The son's behavior is affecting his grades negatively. The parent's reasoning is that the Xbox is contributing to the problem by distracting him from schoolwork.\n\nFrom a typical parenting perspective, it's common to use consequences for poor academic performance, especially if the child's actions are the cause. The parent is trying to enforce accountability. However, some might argue that the gift card is a Christmas present and withholding it might be seen as taking away a gift, which could be unfair. But since the gift card is meant for Xbox, which is part of the problem, the parent might see it as a necessary trade-off.\n\nI need to consider the age of the child. At 14, the son is a teenager, and balancing school and leisure is part of learning responsibility. The parent is trying to teach that lesson. But teenagers can be resistant to restrictions, so there might be tension here.\n\nOther opinions from students could vary. Some might think the parent is right to encourage better study habits, while others might feel it's harsh to take away a gift. But given the information, the parent's action seems like a reasonable consequence to address the son's priorities. There's no indication the parent is being overly strict without cause. The son's grades are suffering due to his own choices, so the parent is addressing the root cause by removing the distraction.\n\nSo, the parent isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
