      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who withheld the Xbox gift card is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation. The parent has a 14-year-old son who's failing math and other subjects because he's spending all his free time on Fortnite instead of doing homework. The parent took away the Xbox gift card as a consequence. The question is whether the parent is wrong for doing that.\n\nFirst, I should consider the parent's reasoning. They're trying to address poor academic performance by removing a privilege that's contributing to the problem. It makes sense that if the son is neglecting homework for gaming, taking away the Xbox could encourage him to focus on his studies. Parents often set boundaries to help children prioritize responsibilities.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the son is still a teenager and might need support or guidance rather than punishment. Maybe the parent could have involved the son in setting goals or provided other forms of motivation. But in this case, the parent is using a tangible consequence related to the behavior itself. That seems like a reasonable approach. Also, the son's grades are dropping, which is a significant issue that needs addressing.\n\nI should also think about the age. At 14, the son is old enough to understand cause and effect. Taking away a privilege he values could be an effective way to get him to change his habits. However, it's possible the parent could be too harsh, but the situation as described doesn't mention any other negative consequences or lack of communication.\n\nAnother angle: Are there alternatives the parent should have considered? Maybe, but the question is about whether they're in the wrong for this specific action. If the parent has discussed the issue with the son and agreed on the consequences in advance, then this action is justified. If not, maybe it's a bit abrupt. But the scenario doesn't mention prior discussions, which could be a point against. However, without that information, it's hard to say.\n\nOverall, the parent's intention is to improve the son's academic performance by removing a distraction. While there might be other methods, the action taken is a common parenting strategy. So, I think the parent is not in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
