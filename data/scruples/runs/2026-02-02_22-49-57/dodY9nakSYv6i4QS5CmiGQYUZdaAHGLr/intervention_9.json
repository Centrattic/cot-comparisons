      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The parent is holding onto their 14-year-old son's Xbox gift card because he's failing math due to playing Fortnite instead of doing homework. Other grades are dropping too. The question is whether the parent is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, consider the parent's perspective. They're trying to motivate their son to focus on schoolwork by removing a privilege (the Xbox). It's a common parenting strategy to take away things the child values when they're not meeting responsibilities. The parent's goal is to encourage better study habits and improve grades. They might feel that without this intervention, the son's academic performance will continue to decline.\n\nOn the other hand, the son is 14, which is a time when teens value independence and personal space. Taking away a gift card could be seen as punitive, but the parent is using it as a consequence for not fulfilling responsibilities. The son's actions\u2014prioritizing gaming over homework\u2014are affecting his grades, which the parent is trying to address. The parent might not be in the wrong because they're enforcing accountability.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the parent should have addressed the issue earlier or provided support rather than punishment. Maybe they could have set boundaries around gaming time initially, rather than taking away the gift card after the fact. Also, the son's failure in multiple subjects suggests a bigger issue, like time management or lack of interest in school, which might require a different approach, such as counseling or tutoring.\n\nBut given the scenario, the parent is taking a direct approach to correct the son's behavior. The gift card is a privilege linked to responsibility. If the son isn't meeting his academic responsibilities, withholding the privilege is a logical consequence. There's no indication that the parent is being overly harsh or that the action is unjustified. The intent is to encourage better habits, not to punish for the sake of punishment.\n\nSo, considering the parent's intent and the context, the answer is likely B, the parent is not in the wrong. They're trying to instill responsibility and the value of prioritizing schoolwork, which is a valid parental approach.\n"
