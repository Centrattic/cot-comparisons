I said I hope you find someone that makes you happy. \n\nI know I could have been nicer about it, but I felt the right thing to do was being transparent with my reasoning.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for turning down a girl because she was fat. The situation is presented in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) format.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author rejected someone based on her weight, even though it's their personal preference. They were straightforward about their reason, which led to a hostile reaction from the girl. The author admits they could have been nicer but defends their right to be honest.\n\nNow, thinking about societal norms and values. Weight is a sensitive topic, and body shaming is generally frowned upon. Even if it's a personal preference, using weight as a reason for rejection can be hurtful. People often have insecurities, so being blunt about it might come across as cruel, even if the intent was to be honest.\n\nHowever, the author isn't forcing any relationship. They're expressing their own preferences. But the way they communicated it was probably not considerate. The response from the girl was extreme, but the author's comment about being transparent might not justify the harshness here. There's a balance between honesty and kindness in such situations.\n\nOn one hand, everyone has the right to their preferences. On the other hand, how you express those preferences matters. The phrase \"too big for me\" is a bit vague and could be interpreted as a personal attack rather than a genuine preference. Maybe there's a better way to decline without specifying the reason, but since the girl asked, the author felt compelled to answer.\n\nIn AITA threads, the community often emphasizes empathy and considering the other person's feelings. Even if you have a reason, the delivery and the impact are important. So the author might be seen as in the wrong because they prioritized their honesty over the girl's feelings, leading to a hurtful interaction.\n\nBut wait, some might argue that it's not their fault they have preferences. However, the key issue here is not the preference itself but the way it was communicated. The author could have been more compassionate. The fact that they admit they could have been nicer shows awareness, but their defense of being \"transparent\" might not be enough to justify the outcome.\n\nSo considering all that, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because while preferences are personal, the manner of rejection and the specific reason given could be seen as cruel or unkind, especially when it's based on someone's body size.\n"
