I told her \"Sorry but this isn't going to happen\" and when she asked me why I said, only this, that she is \"Too big for for me.\" She proceeded to say Fuck you and I hope you die. I said I hope you find someone that makes you happy. \n\nI know I could have been nicer about it, but I felt the right thing to do was being transparent with my reasoning. I am allowed to have a preference of non-fat people and if they ask why me, I believe it is justified that I don't sugarcoat shit and give them my truth.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who turned down the girl because she was fat is in the wrong. The question is whether the author is at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The guy rejected the girl using the reason that she was \"too big\" for him. He was called a \"friend\" by the person trying to set them up. The girl responded angrily, and he tried to be honest about his preference. He admits he could have been nicer but thought being transparent was right.\n\nNow, the main issue is whether the reason for rejection is valid. Weight is a personal preference, but is it acceptable to state it directly? In some cultures, being blunt about physical attributes might be considered rude. Also, there's the aspect of respecting someone's feelings. Even if it's a personal preference, delivering it in a harsh way can hurt someone's self-esteem.\n\nThe guy says he was transparent, but the way he phrased it as \"Too big for me\" could come off as dismissive. There's a difference between having a preference and making someone feel unwanted because of their size. The girl's reaction was strong, but her response was also aggressive. However, that doesn't necessarily justify the guy's reasoning. \n\nThere's also the question of whether it's okay to have such preferences. People have different attractions, but when it comes to weight, it's often tied to societal issues like body shaming. Even if he's allowed to have preferences, the way he communicated it could be problematic. Being honest is good, but being tactless can be hurtful.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author might be in the wrong because while he's allowed to have preferences, the way he communicated them was not kind. The answer might lean towards A (Yes, in the wrong) because respect and kindness are expected even when rejecting someone.\n"
