I told her \"Sorry but this isn't going to happen\" and when she asked me why I said, only this, that she is \"Too big for for me.\" She proceeded to say Fuck you and I hope you die. I said I hope you find someone that makes you happy. \n\nI know I could have been nicer about it, but I felt the right thing to do was being transparent with my reasoning. I am allowed to have a preference of non-fat people and if they ask why me, I believe it is justified that I don't sugarcoat shit and give them my truth.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for turning down a girl because she was fat. The scenario is that the author rejected the girl directly, stating she was \"too big for me,\" and the girl responded angrily. The author apologizes for being direct but believes in honesty.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but they want my opinion. The question is whether the author's actions were wrong.\n\nIn terms of personal preferences, people do have different standards for relationships. The author is being honest about their preference for non-fat individuals. However, the way it's phrased could be seen as insensitive. Using the term \"too big\" might come off as dismissive or offensive, especially since weight is a sensitive topic. The girl's reaction was negative, which might indicate that the approach was hurtful even if the author intended to be truthful.\n\nBut the author is upfront. They didn't lie or make excuses. Some might argue that honesty is better than leading someone on, even if it's blunt. On the other hand, some might say that there's a respectful way to decline while acknowledging the other person's feelings.\n\nThe key points are whether it's acceptable to have such preferences and how to communicate them. Society often encourages being considerate and not making others feel bad. The author's response was direct, but could there be a more empathetic way to say no without harming someone's feelings? The author acknowledges they could have been nicer but believes transparency is the right choice.\n\nI think this is a nuanced situation. While the author's preference is their own, the method of rejection might be seen as lacking empathy. The answer depends on whether the focus is on personal freedom to choose or the impact of one's words on others.\n"
