I told her \"Sorry but this isn't going to happen\" and when she asked me why I said, only this, that she is \"Too big for for me.\" She proceeded to say Fuck you and I hope you die. I said I hope you find someone that makes you happy. \n\nI know I could have been nicer about it, but I felt the right thing to do was being transparent with my reasoning. I am allowed to have a preference of non-fat people and if they ask why me, I believe it is justified that I don't sugarcoat shit and give them my truth.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for turning down a girl because she was fat. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author rejected someone due to her weight, being straightforward about it. The girl responded angrily. The author admits they could have been nicer but believes honesty was appropriate.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong. I need to consider societal norms, respect, and personal preferences. People have different preferences, and it's their right to choose who they're attracted to. However, the way it was communicated might be an issue. The author was direct and possibly hurtful, but they didn't use derogatory language. The key points are whether their honesty was justified and if the comment was respectful.\n\nIn many societies, weight is a sensitive topic. Telling someone they're \"too big\" might be seen as insensitive, even if it's a preference. The girl's reaction indicates she felt disrespected. The author's argument is about transparency, but in social interactions, kindness is often expected. So, even if the author's intent was honest, the manner might be considered wrong. But there's a difference between being honest and being cruel. The author didn't attack her character, just stated a preference. However, the phrase \"too big for me\" could be interpreted as fat-shaming.\n\nI think the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because while preferences are valid, the way it was communicated lacked empathy. People are expected to be respectful, even when declining someone. Saying \"too big\" is a blunt way to express a preference that's often associated with weight discrimination. The author could have been honest without being hurtful. So, the wrong lies in the phrasing and not considering the other person's feelings.\n"
