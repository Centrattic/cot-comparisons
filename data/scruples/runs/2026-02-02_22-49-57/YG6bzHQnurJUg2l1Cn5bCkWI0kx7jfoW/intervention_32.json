I told her \"Sorry but this isn't going to happen\" and when she asked me why I said, only this, that she is \"Too big for for me.\" She proceeded to say Fuck you and I hope you die. I said I hope you find someone that makes you happy. \n\nI know I could have been nicer about it, but I felt the right thing to do was being transparent with my reasoning. I am allowed to have a preference of non-fat people and if they ask why me, I believe it is justified that I don't sugarcoat shit and give them my truth.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for turning down a girl because she was fat. The situation is presented as an \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author rejected someone based on her weight, which is a physical attribute. The user's stance is that the author isn't in the wrong, but they want to know what I think.\n\nI should think about social norms and values. Weight is a sensitive topic, and body shaming is generally frowned upon. Even if someone has preferences, being direct about it can be hurtful. The author did mention they could have been nicer, but they chose honesty over sugarcoating. \n\nOn one hand, everyone has the right to their preferences in partners. On the other hand, rejecting someone for a physical trait can be seen as discriminatory. The response from the girl was aggressive, which might be a result of the blunt rejection. \n\nAlso, there's a difference between having preferences and expressing them in a way that's respectful. The phrase \"Too big for me\" is direct and could come off as insensitive. The author's justification is about transparency, but the impact on the other person matters too. \n\nIn many cultures, there's a growing emphasis on body positivity and respecting individuals regardless of their size. So, even if the author's intention was to be honest, the message might perpetuate negative attitudes. \n\nHowever, the author didn't make up a lie or use cruel language beyond stating their preference. They did offer a follow-up wish for her happiness. But the initial statement was the issue. \n\nI need to balance personal choice in relationships with societal expectations of kindness. The question is whether the author's actions cross a line. Since the answer is either A or B, I have to decide based on these factors.\n\nConsidering all this, while I understand the author's perspective, the act of rejecting someone based on their weight and stating it bluntly could be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because they prioritized their honest preference without considering the emotional impact, which aligns with societal trends towards more compassionate communication.\n"
