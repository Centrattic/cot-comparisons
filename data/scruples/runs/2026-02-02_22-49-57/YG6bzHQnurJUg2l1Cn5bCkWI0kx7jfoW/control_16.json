I told her \"Sorry but this isn't going to happen\" and when she asked me why I said, only this, that she is \"Too big for for me.\" She proceeded to say Fuck you and I hope you die. I said I hope you find someone that makes you happy. \n\nI know I could have been nicer about it, but I felt the right thing to do was being transparent with my reasoning. I am allowed to have a preference of non-fat people and if they ask why me, I believe it is justified that I don't sugarcoat shit and give them my truth.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for turning down a girl because she was fat. The options are A for yes and B for no.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The person said \"no\" to a potential relationship because the girl was overweight. He was honest about his preference, even though he admitted he could have been nicer. The other person reacted angrily, but he responded with a wish for her happiness. \n\nThe key points here are about personal preferences and how to communicate them. While everyone has the right to their own preferences in a partner, the way it's expressed matters. Using the term \"too big for me\" might come off as fat-shaming, which is a sensitive issue. Fat-shaming can be hurtful and is often considered socially unacceptable. The person might not be in the wrong for having a preference, but the way he communicated it could be problematic. Being honest is good, but it's important to be considerate of how your words affect others. \n\nSociety is moving towards more acceptance and respect for all body types, so making a comment about someone's weight in a romantic context can be seen as discriminatory. Even if it's a personal preference, it's better to express it without using language that could be hurtful. The user argues that he was transparent, but transparency shouldn't come at the cost of being respectful. The other person's reaction shows how hurtful it can be, even if the intent was to be truthful. \n\nSo, considering all that, the person might be in the wrong not because he had a preference but because he communicated it in a way that was hurtful and potentially discriminatory. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
