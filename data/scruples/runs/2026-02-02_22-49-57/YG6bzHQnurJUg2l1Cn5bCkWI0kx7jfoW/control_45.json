I said I hope you find someone that makes you happy. \n\nI know I could have been nicer about it, but I felt the right thing to do was being transparent with my reasoning.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for turning down a girl because she was fat.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was set up by a friend with someone who is significantly overweight. He directly told her he's not interested because she's \"too big for me.\" She reacted angrily, and he responded with a wish for her to find happiness.\n\nThe key points here are the author's reasoning and how he communicated it. He admits he could have been nicer but insists on being honest. The question is whether his action was wrong.\n\nIn terms of social norms, while everyone has preferences, using weight as a reason for rejection can be seen as discriminatory. Body shaming is generally frowned upon, especially in dating contexts. However, the author didn't hide his reasons; he was upfront. \n\nBut is being honest about preferences acceptable? Some might argue that it's okay to have personal preferences, but others might say that using weight as a reason is hurtful and contributes to negative stereotypes. The response \"Too big for me\" could be interpreted as a fatphobic comment. \n\nThe author's response to her anger was to wish her happiness, which shows some level of empathy. Still, the initial rejection was based on her size, which is a sensitive issue. \n\nI think the debate here is between being honest about preferences versus being respectful. While the author is transparent, the manner in which he communicates his preference may be seen as lacking in sensitivity. Weight-based discrimination is a real issue, so the action could be considered wrong in that context. \n\nTherefore, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because of the discriminatory implication, even if he was honest.\n"
