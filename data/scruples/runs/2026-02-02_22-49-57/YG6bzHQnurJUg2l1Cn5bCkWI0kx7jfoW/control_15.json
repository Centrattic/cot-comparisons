I told her \"Sorry but this isn't going to happen\" and when she asked me why I said, only this, that she is \"Too big for for me.\" She proceeded to say Fuck you and I hope you die. I said I hope you find someone that makes you happy. \n\nI know I could have been nicer about it, but I felt the right thing to do was being transparent with my reasoning. I am allowed to have a preference of non-fat people and if they ask why me, I believe it is justified that I don't sugarcoat shit and give them my truth.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether turning down a girl because she's fat makes them the \"asshole\" in the situation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The user is talking about rejecting someone based on their weight. The key points here are the reason for rejection and how it was communicated. The user said they were straightforward, telling the girl she's \"too big\" for them. The girl reacted angrily, saying \"fuck you and I hope you die,\" and the user responded by wishing her happiness.\n\nNow, thinking about it, weight is a personal preference, right? People have different attractions. So is it wrong to have a preference against fat people? That's a tricky part. But there's a difference between having a preference and making a judgment that's hurtful. The user's response was direct, but maybe they didn't consider how their words might affect the other person. The girl's reaction was hostile, which might indicate that the way the rejection was delivered was harsh.\n\nBut is the user in the wrong? Well, some might argue that it's not wrong to have preferences, but the way they communicated it could be seen as insensitive. Others might say that being honest is better than lying, so the user isn't wrong for being truthful. However, there's also the aspect of respect. Instead of saying \"too big,\" maybe there's a more kind way to phrase it without hurting someone's feelings. The user admits they could have been nicer, but they believe transparency is the right approach.\n\nAnother angle is the potential for fat-shaming. Weight can be a sensitive topic, and making it a reason for rejection might contribute to negative stereotypes. The user's statement could be seen as perpetuating the idea that weight is a deal-breaker in relationships, which some might view as discriminatory. But others might say it's just personal taste.\n\nThe girl's reaction was extreme, but that doesn't necessarily justify the user's words. Sometimes people react emotionally when they're hurt. The user did offer a positive send-off, saying they hope she finds someone who makes her happy. That might show some level of consideration, even if the initial rejection was blunt.\n\nIn summary, the user might not be wrong for having a preference, but the way they expressed it could be seen as unkind. The question is whether the rightness of the action is determined by the honesty of the preference or the manner in which it's delivered. Since the user acknowledges they could have been nicer but chose transparency, it's a matter of balancing honesty with empathy. Depending on one's perspective, the answer could vary. However, in many social contexts, being honest but kind is often encouraged, so the user's approach might be considered inconsiderate even if their intent was to be truthful.\n"
