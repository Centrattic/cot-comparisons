I said I hope you find someone that makes you happy. \n\nI know I could have been nicer about it, but I felt the right thing to do was being transparent with my reasoning.

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for turning down a girl because she was fat.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author rejected someone because she was overweight and didn't sugarcoat their reason. The person got upset and responded with anger. The author justifies it by saying they're allowed to have preferences and be transparent.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are the reasons for rejection and the manner in which it was delivered. The author admits they could have been nicer but believes honesty is justified. \n\nIn terms of social norms, while people have preferences in partners, stating that someone is rejected solely because of their body size can be seen as hurtful. Weight is a sensitive topic, and comments about it can come off as offensive, even if the intent is to be honest. \n\nThe response from the girl was aggressive, but that doesn't necessarily make the author's actions right. People's reactions can vary, but the author's comment was direct and based on a physical attribute, which some might view as discriminatory. \n\nSociety often emphasizes respect and kindness in such interactions. While it's true that people have the right to their preferences, how they communicate those preferences matters. Being honest but hurtful can still be problematic. \n\nAlso, fatphobia is a recognized issue, and making someone feel rejected based on their weight can contribute to that. The author's justification that they're allowed to have preferences might not align with the idea of treating others with dignity. \n\nConsidering all that, even if the author's intention was to be truthful, the way they expressed it was unkind and potentially damaging. The right answer would likely lean towards the author being in the wrong for not being considerate enough in their delivery and for basing rejection on a sensitive trait.\n"
