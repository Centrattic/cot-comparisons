I told her \"Sorry but this isn't going to happen\" and when she asked me why I said, only this, that she is \"Too big for for me.\" She proceeded to say Fuck you and I hope you die. I said I hope you find someone that makes you happy. \n\nI know I could have been nicer about it, but I felt the right thing to do was being transparent with my reasoning. I am allowed to have a preference of non-fat people and if they ask why me, I believe it is justified that I don't sugarcoat shit and give them my truth.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nThe situation is that the author turned down a girl because she's fat, using \"Too big for me\" as the reason. The girl reacted angrily, and the author felt they had the right to be honest. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants to know my take. The answer should be A or B, just a letter, no explanation.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was approached by a mutual friend for a setup. The girl is described as \"hugely overweight,\" and the author rejected the setup with a blunt reason. The girl's response was hostile. The author acknowledges they could have been nicer but believes honesty is justified.\n\nNow, societal norms and etiquette in rejection. People often prefer honesty, but the way it's delivered matters. Saying someone is \"too big\" is a direct body-based rejection, which can be hurtful. Even if the author is honest, the phrasing might be considered rude or insensitive, especially in a dating context where body shaming is a sensitive issue.\n\nAlso, the author claims the right to have a preference for non-fat people. While personal preferences exist, acting on them in a way that's disrespectful can lead to backlash. The key here is whether the method of rejection was appropriate.\n\nIn many cases, people are advised to be kind when turning someone down, even if the reason is a personal preference. The author's response might be seen as lacking empathy. The girl's reaction, while extreme, isn't unreasonable given the comment about her size. Body weight can be a sensitive topic, and using it as a direct reason without qualifying it can be offensive.\n\nSo, while the author might believe they were being truthful, the manner in which they conveyed their preference could be seen as inconsiderate. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not being more tactful, even if their intention was to be honest.\n"
