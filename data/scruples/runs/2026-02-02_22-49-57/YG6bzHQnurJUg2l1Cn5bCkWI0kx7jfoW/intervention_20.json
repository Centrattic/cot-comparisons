I said I hope you find someone that makes you happy. \n\nI know I could have been nicer about it, but I felt the right thing to do was being transparent with my reasoning.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether it's acceptable to reject someone for being overweight and then face backlash.\n\nFirst, the author was approached by a friend to set up a date with a girl who's significantly overweight. He turned her down, stating she was \"too big for me.\" The girl reacted angrily, and the author defended his right to be honest about his preferences.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and personal preferences. People often have preferences in partners, and it's generally accepted that you can't be forced to date someone. However, the way the author communicated his rejection might be an issue. He was direct, but the comment \"too big for me\" could come off as insensitive or cruel, especially if it's the only reason given. While it's true that people have the right to their preferences, the manner of expressing those preferences can affect how others feel. The author acknowledges he could have been nicer, but he insists on being transparent. \n\nOn one hand, honesty is valued, but there's also a social expectation to be considerate. The girl's response was harsh, but maybe the author's bluntness contributed to that. The key here is whether the author's method of rejection was inconsiderate. While the content of the rejection (based on weight) might be a personal choice, the delivery could be seen as lacking empathy. \n\nIn many discussions about such topics, people argue that while preferences are personal, making someone feel bad about their body isn't okay. The author's statement might be seen as contributing to body shaming, which is generally frowned upon. So even if he's allowed to have his preferences, the way he expressed them might place him in the wrong. \n\nBut then again, some might argue that if someone asks why they were rejected, you have the right to tell the truth. However, the context matters. The girl was already in a vulnerable position, and the author's response didn't leave room for compassion. \n\nSo, balancing personal freedom to have preferences against the social responsibility to be kind, the author's approach might be considered inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong) because of the manner in which he conveyed his preferences, even if the content is his right.\n"
