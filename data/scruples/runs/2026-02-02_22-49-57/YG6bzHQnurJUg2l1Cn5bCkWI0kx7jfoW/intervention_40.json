I told her \"Sorry but this isn't going to happen\" and when she asked me why I said, only this, that she is \"Too big for for me.\" She proceeded to say Fuck you and I hope you die. I said I hope you find someone that makes you happy. \n\nI know I could have been nicer about it, but I felt the right thing to do was being transparent with my reasoning. I am allowed to have a preference of non-fat people and if they ask why me, I believe it is justified that I don't sugarcoat shit and give them my truth.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who turned down a girl because she was fat is in the wrong. The scenario is from an \"Am I the Asshole?\" context, so they're looking for a judgment call.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author said they turned down the girl because she was \"too big for me\" and then got a hostile response. They admit they could have been nicer but believe transparency was justified. \n\nNow, the main question is about right or wrong. From an ethical standpoint, people have preferences in partners, which is normal. However, stating a preference based on weight in such a direct and blunt manner might come off as hurtful or disrespectful. Weight is a sensitive topic and can be associated with body shaming. Even though the author wasn't outright cruel, the way they phrased it without considering the emotional impact could be problematic.\n\nAlso, the woman's reaction, while aggressive, might be a result of feeling judged or rejected. The author's right to have preferences is valid, but how they communicated that is where the issue lies. Being honest is important, but it's also about being considerate and empathetic. Sugarcoating isn't always necessary, but phrasing things in a way that minimizes harm is usually better in such situations.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, body shaming is generally frowned upon, and weight-based rejection can contribute to negative self-image issues. The author might not be in the wrong for having preferences, but their delivery could be seen as lacking in tact and respect. So, while the action of declining isn't inherently wrong, the manner in which it was done is questionable.\n"
