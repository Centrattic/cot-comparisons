I told her \"Sorry but this isn't going to happen\" and when she asked me why I said, only this, that she is \"Too big for for me.\" She proceeded to say Fuck you and I hope you die. I said I hope you find someone that makes you happy. \n\nI know I could have been nicer about it, but I felt the right thing to do was being transparent with my reasoning.

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for turning down a girl because she was fat. The situation is presented in a Reddit-style \"Am I the Asshole\" scenario. The author's response was direct, stating that the girl was \"too big for me,\" and the girl responded angrily. The author admits they could have been nicer but believes being transparent was the right choice.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and social aspects. The key issue here is whether it's acceptable to reject someone based on their weight. Weight can be a sensitive topic, and body shaming is generally frowned upon. However, personal preferences in relationships are typically considered a personal matter. But there's a line between having a personal preference and being discriminatory. \n\nIn many places, weight isn't a protected class, so legally, the author might not be in the wrong. But socially, there's a difference between expressing a personal preference and making a judgment that could be hurtful. The author's approach was direct, which could be seen as honest, but the way it was delivered might be considered harsh. \n\nThe girl's reaction was extreme, but that doesn't necessarily justify the author's statement. The question is whether the author's reasoning is valid. If the author is being honest about their preferences without malice, it's a matter of personal choice. However, if the statement is contributing to harmful stereotypes or weight stigma, that's a different issue. \n\nAlso, the author's closing remark about wanting the girl to find someone who makes her happy could be seen as a mitigating factor, showing some level of empathy despite the rejection. \n\nI need to weigh whether being honest about one's preferences is acceptable versus contributing to a negative environment. The answer might depend on the context and the intent. If the author is simply stating their preference without attacking the person's worth, it's more about personal choice. But if the statement is hurtful and dismissive, it could be seen as rude or inconsiderate. \n\nIn the end, while the author isn't legally in the wrong, socially, there's a debate. The answer options are A (wrong) or B (not wrong). Considering that the user thinks the author isn't wrong and the discussion points, the answer is likely B. But I should check if there's any other angle. The user's own opinion is that the author isn't wrong, but the question is asking for a more objective analysis. However, in these scenarios, the community often debates the social acceptability. The author's transparency might be seen as honest, but the direct mention of weight could be problematic. However, in AITA forums, the focus is often on intent and harm. The author didn't use cruel language beyond stating the preference, so maybe B is correct.\n"
