      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for turning down a girl because she was fat.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author was set up with a girl who is described as \"hugely overweight\" (5'6\", ~325 lbs). He directly told her he's not interested because she's \"too big for me.\" She responded angrily, and he said he wishes her happiness. The author admits he could have been nicer but insists on being transparent about his preference for non-fat people.\n\nNow, considering social norms and ethics. Body size is a common preference in dating, but is it acceptable to state it so bluntly? While people should be allowed to have personal preferences, the way it's communicated matters. Using a direct and potentially hurtful comment like \"too big\" might be seen as disrespectful. Also, weight is a sensitive topic and can relate to health issues or self-esteem. Even if the author believes it's his right to have preferences, the manner in which he conveyed them could be considered inconsiderate.\n\nAnother angle: the girl's reaction was harsh, but that doesn't justify the author's approach. However, her response might indicate she felt disrespected. The author's justification is about honesty, but sugarcoating rejections is often expected to avoid hurting feelings. There's also the aspect of weight discrimination. While it's not illegal in some contexts, it's still a form of bias. The question is whether the author's actions cross into harmful behavior or just a blunt rejection.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might have had the right to decline, the way he did it might be seen as tactless. The key is whether being honest justifies the lack of empathy. So, the answer might be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because of the harsh delivery and potential insensitivity, even if the preference itself isn't inherently wrong.\n"
