I told her \"Sorry but this isn't going to happen\" and when she asked me why I said, only this, that she is \"Too big for for me.\" She proceeded to say Fuck you and I hope you die. I said I hope you find someone that makes you happy. \n\nI know I could have been nicer about it, but I felt the right thing to do was being transparent with my reasoning. I am allowed to have a preference of non-fat people and if they ask why me, I believe it is justified that I don't sugarcoat shit and give them my truth.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about turning down a girl because she's overweight, and the person says they were honest about their preference.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Weight is a personal preference for some people, but is it acceptable to express that in a direct way, especially when it leads to a hostile reaction? The user mentions that the girl responded with anger and a death wish, which is pretty extreme. \n\nNow, the key points are: the person was upfront about their preference, which they feel is valid. But they also acknowledge they could have been nicer. The question is whether being honest about a preference, even if it's hurtful, is justified.\n\nIn terms of social norms, while people have the right to their preferences, how they communicate those preferences matters. Being blunt and potentially hurtful might be seen as inconsiderate. The response from the girl was extreme, but the initial comment might have contributed to that. \n\nAlso, from a sensitivity standpoint, fatphobia is a real issue, and making weight a deal-breaker can be seen as discriminatory. However, the person is saying it's their personal choice. The debate here is between honesty and kindness.\n\nThe user's justification is that they were transparent. But others might argue that even if it's a personal preference, the way it's delivered can be offensive. The line between honesty and cruelty is thin here.\n\nConsidering all this, the answer might hinge on whether the person's actions were respectful. Since they used a direct comment about the girl's weight, which is a sensitive topic, and it caused a negative reaction, it's possible they're in the wrong. But some might side with them if they believe personal preferences are acceptable as long as they're not illegal. \n\nHowever, in social contexts, respect and empathy are often expected, even when expressing preferences. The fact that the person admitted they could have been nicer suggests they recognize the potential hurt, which might lean towards them being in the wrong for not considering the other person's feelings.\n"
