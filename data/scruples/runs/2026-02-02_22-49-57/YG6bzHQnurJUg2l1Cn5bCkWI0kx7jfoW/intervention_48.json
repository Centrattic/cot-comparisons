      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for turning down a girl because she was fat. The author said \"Too big for me\" directly, which led to a negative reaction from the girl. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author called the girl \"huge,\" \"overweight,\" and mentioned her weight (325 lbs). The girl was a friend's attempt to set them up. The author was upfront about their preference for non-fat people. The question is whether this is acceptable or if the author was wrong.\n\nOn one hand, people have personal preferences in relationships. It's their right to be honest about what they're looking for. But on the other hand, using weight as a reason can be seen as size discrimination. Weight is a sensitive topic, and making a direct rejection based on it might be hurtful. The author acknowledges they could have been nicer but believes honesty is justified.\n\nI should think about societal norms and whether weight-based rejection is considered acceptable. In many places, body shaming is frowned upon. However, in personal relationships, people often have different standards. The key here is whether the approach was respectful. The author was direct but didn't use harsh language beyond stating their preference. However, the girl's response was aggressive (\"Fuck you and I hope you die\"), which might indicate the rejection was perceived as hurtful.\n\nThe author's justification is that they are allowed to have preferences and should be truthful when asked. But maybe the way they expressed it could be improved. Instead of focusing on the weight, perhaps they could phrase it more about compatibility or personal chemistry without specifying the reason. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not about how to handle it better.\n\nConsidering all that, the answer hinges on whether being honest about a preference is acceptable. If the author's intention was to be upfront rather than deceptive, then they might not be in the wrong. However, if the method of communication was unnecessarily hurtful without any consideration for the other person's feelings, that could be problematic. But in this case, the author didn't use derogatory terms beyond stating the preference. So, I think the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
