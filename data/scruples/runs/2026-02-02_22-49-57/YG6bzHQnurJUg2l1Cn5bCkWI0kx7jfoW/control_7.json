I told her \"Sorry but this isn't going to happen\" and when she asked me why I said, only this, that she is \"Too big for for me.\" She proceeded to say Fuck you and I hope you die. I said I hope you find someone that makes you happy. \n\nI know I could have been nicer about it, but I felt the right thing to do was being transparent with my reasoning. I am allowed to have a preference of non-fat people and if they ask why me, I believe it is justified that I don't sugarcoat shit and give them my truth.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author turned down a girl because she was fat, and the girl responded angrily.\n\nFirst, I need to consider societal norms and values. Weight is a sensitive topic, and people often face discrimination based on their size. The author was honest about their preference, but is being honest about physical preferences acceptable here?\n\nThen there's the aspect of respect. Even if someone's preferences are based on looks, how they communicate them matters. The author's response was direct but maybe not empathetic. Could a more compassionate approach have been better? The user acknowledges they could have been nicer, which shows some self-awareness.\n\nAlso, the girl's reaction was harsh, but that doesn't justify the author's comment. The key is whether the author's statement was offensive or discriminatory. Weight is a protected class in some contexts, but in dating, it's a personal preference. However, making a general statement like \"too big\" might be seen as body-shaming, which is frowned upon.\n\nAnother angle: the author's right to their preferences versus the potential harm caused. While everyone has the right to their preferences, expressing them in a way that hurts someone else can be problematic. The line between honesty and cruelty is thin here.\n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be in the wrong for having preferences, but the way they communicated it could be seen as insensitive. However, depending on the context, some might argue that the author is in the wrong for using weight as a criterion. The question hinges on whether it's acceptable to be blunt about such preferences. The answer likely leans towards the author being in the wrong because of the potential for harm and the lack of sensitivity in the delivery.\n"
