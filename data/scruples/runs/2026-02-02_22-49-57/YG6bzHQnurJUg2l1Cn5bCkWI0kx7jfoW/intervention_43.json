I told her \"Sorry but this isn't going to happen\" and when she asked me why I said, only this, that she is \"Too big for for me.\" She proceeded to say Fuck you and I hope you die. I said I hope you find someone that makes you happy. \n\nI know I could have been nicer about it, but I felt the right thing to do was being transparent with my reasoning. I am allowed to have a preference of non-fat people and if they ask why me, I believe it is justified that I don't sugarcoat shit and give them my truth.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about someone rejecting a girl because she's overweight. The writer says they were direct but not cruel, just stating their preference for non-fat people.\n\nHmm, so first, I need to think about societal norms and personal preferences. People have different preferences in partners, and it's their right to be honest about that. But there's also the aspect of respect and sensitivity. The writer might be in the wrong if their comment was hurtful, even if it's their preference. However, the user argues that the writer isn't wrong because they were honest. \n\nBut wait, even if it's a personal preference, saying someone is \"too big\" can be seen as offensive or disrespectful. There's a difference between having a preference and being derogatory. The key here is whether the way the preference was communicated was acceptable. The writer did apologize and offered a kind closing, but the initial statement might still be problematic. \n\nAlso, considering body shaming is a sensitive topic. Many people find it harmful when someone rejects others based on weight, as it contributes to negative body image. The response from the girl was hostile, but that doesn't necessarily justify the writer's comment. They could have been more empathetic.\n\nSo, while personal preferences are valid, the manner of expressing them matters. The writer's approach might not be the worst, but there's a case to be made that they should have been more considerate. However, if they were just stating their preference without malice, maybe they aren't entirely wrong. It's a bit of a gray area. But leaning towards the answer being A (in the wrong) because even if it's a preference, the way it's communicated can be hurtful and contributes to body shaming.\n"
