I told her \"Sorry but this isn't going to happen\" and when she asked me why I said, only this, that she is \"Too big for for me.\" She proceeded to say Fuck you and I hope you die. I said I hope you find someone that makes you happy. \n\nI know I could have been nicer about it, but I felt the right thing to do was being transparent with my reasoning. I am allowed to have a preference of non-fat people and if they ask why me, I believe it is justified that I don't sugarcoat shit and give them my truth.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for turning down a girl because she was fat. The options are A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The user says they rejected someone because she was \"too big for me,\" which is a direct comment on her weight. The person got a hostile response, and the author justifies it by saying they were transparent and have preferences. They mention they could have been nicer but chose to be honest.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and respectful behavior. Weight is a sensitive issue, and using it as a reason for rejection can be seen as discriminatory or hurtful. Even if someone has personal preferences, expressing them in a way that's blunt can cause harm. The key here is whether the manner of the rejection was appropriate.\n\nThe author claims they are entitled to their preference. While it's true that people can have personal preferences, the way they communicated it was not kind. The response \"Too big for me\" is a direct and potentially offensive comment on her body. There's a difference between having preferences and expressing them in a respectful way. Maybe there's a more compassionate way to say no without focusing on her size.\n\nAlso, the girl's reaction was aggressive, but that doesn't excuse the author's bluntness. However, people are allowed to have honest conversations if they're tactful. But in this case, the author didn't soften their message, which could have minimized hurt feelings. The justification that they \"don't sugarcoat\" might not hold in terms of social etiquette, where kindness is usually expected even when being honest.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's reasoning might not be wrong in their own eyes, but societal standards often value kindness and sensitivity over blunt honesty, especially on topics like weight that are tied to body image issues. Therefore, the answer would likely be A, the author is in the wrong because their rejection was based on a sensitive aspect of the person's identity and delivered without tact.\n"
