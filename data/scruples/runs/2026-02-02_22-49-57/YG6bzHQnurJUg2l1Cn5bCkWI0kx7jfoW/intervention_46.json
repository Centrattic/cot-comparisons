      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for turning down a girl because she was fat. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author was set up with a girl who is described as \"hugely overweight\" (5'6\", ~325 lbs). He told her he wasn't interested because she was \"too big for me.\" The girl responded angrily, saying \"Fuck you and I hope you die,\" and the author replied wishing her happiness. The author admits he could have been nicer but believes it's right to be honest about his preferences.\n\nFirst, I should consider the social norms and cultural context. In many places, weight discrimination is considered a sensitive issue. While people can have personal preferences, outright rejecting someone based on weight can be seen as discriminatory. However, the author isn't making a general statement against fat people; he's stating a personal preference. \n\nBut then, there's the way he communicated it. Saying \"too big for me\" is a blunt way to express that preference. Even though he says he's honest, the manner in which he delivered the message might have been hurtful. The girl's reaction was aggressive, which might indicate that the rejection was particularly harsh for her. However, her response includes a death wish, which is definitely inappropriate, but that's her reaction.\n\nThe author claims he's justified in not sugarcoating. In some contexts, honesty is appreciated, but when it comes to physical attributes, especially weight, people often prefer to hear it tactfully, if at all. There's a difference between honesty and cruelty. The author could have been more considerate. For example, saying it's not a good match without focusing on her weight might have been better, even if it's not entirely honest. \n\nAlso, there's the aspect of respect. Even if someone has a preference, expressing it in a way that's dismissive can be seen as disrespectful. The girl might feel that her worth is being judged solely on her appearance, which is a common concern in discussions about body image. \n\nHowever, the author isn't forcing his preferences on her or treating her poorly beyond the rejection. He's not making a public statement or shaming her beyond a direct refusal. He's also not in the wrong for having a preference, since people have different standards. The issue is whether expressing that preference in such a blunt manner is acceptable.\n\nIn terms of ethics, the author isn't committing a crime or violating any laws. But socially, there's a debate about whether it's acceptable to state such preferences so directly. Some might argue it's the truth and they have the right to be honest, while others might see it as contributing to a culture of body shaming.\n\nThe girl's aggressive response is also a factor. Her reaction is extreme, but that doesn't justify the author's approach. The author's response of wishing her happiness is a positive note, showing some empathy despite the rejection.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author's main fault is the lack of tact in expressing his preference. While he's not in the wrong for having a preference, the way he communicated it could be seen as disrespectful. Therefore, the answer might be A (he is in the wrong) because of the manner of his rejection, even if his intent was to be honest.\n"
