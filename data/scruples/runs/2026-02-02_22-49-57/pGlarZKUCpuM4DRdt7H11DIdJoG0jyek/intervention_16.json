In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user wants to know if the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) situation is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person's parents divorced, their mom remarried, and they've been living with her. The stepdad isn't close with them, they argue a lot, and the stepdad hasn't really made an effort to get to know them. The mom refers to him as \"your father,\" and the person says he's not their dad. The mom got angry, called them ungrateful, and hasn't spoken to them since. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Well, the person's stance is that they don't feel comfortable calling the stepfather \"Dad\" because of the strained relationship. From what's described, the stepfather hasn't made an effort to bond or be nice. The mom is pushing for the term, which might be causing tension. The person isn't being aggressive; they just state a fact. The mom's reaction seems harsh, especially since the person didn't express anger but just stated their position.\n\nI think the key here is the person's right to choose familial terms. If the stepfather isn't acting like a father figure, it's reasonable not to call him Dad. The mom's anger might stem from wanting to present a united front, but the person's feelings are valid. They might not be at fault here. The stepdad's behavior also plays a role; if he's not making an effort, the person's reluctance makes sense.\n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably B\u2014No, the author isn't in the wrong. They have legitimate reasons for their stance, and the mom's reaction seems excessive. The stepfather's lack of effort and the resulting conflict contribute to the situation.\n"
