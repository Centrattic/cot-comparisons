In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The parents are divorced, the mom remarried, and the stepdad isn't close with the author. They argue a lot, and the stepdad hasn't tried to get to know the author. When the mom refers to him as \"your father,\" the author says \"he's not my dad,\" leading to the mom being upset. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nHmm. The author's reasoning is valid. A stepfather is a legal and familial term, but calling someone \"Dad\" is a personal choice. The stepfather hasn't built a relationship, and there's tension. The mom is pushing the author to refer to him as \"father,\" which the author isn't comfortable with. The author isn't being disrespectful; they're stating a fact. The stepdad isn't their biological father, and the relationship is strained. The mom's reaction seems harsh, expecting the author to accept a term that's not meaningful or accurate in their case. So, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to choose how they address family members. Answer B.\n"
