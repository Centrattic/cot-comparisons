In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not calling their stepfather \"Dad.\" \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The parents are divorced, and the mom remarried. The stepdad isn't close to the kid, they argue a lot, and the kid doesn't want to call him dad. The mom got angry and hasn't spoken to the kid since.\n\nSo, the key points here: The stepfather hasn't tried to build a relationship, there's tension, and the kid feels it's not right to call him dad. The mom is upset because she wants the kid to accept him. \n\nLegally, the stepfather isn't the biological dad, so there's no obligation. Emotionally, the kid has valid reasons for not wanting to use the term \"Dad.\" The mom's reaction seems harsh, expecting the kid to accept someone who hasn't made an effort. \n\nThe kid's response was a factual statement, not an attack. The mom's anger might stem from feeling rejected, but the kid's feelings are also valid. So, the kid isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
