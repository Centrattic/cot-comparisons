In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" I need to analyze the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the author explains that their parents got divorced, and their mom remarried. The stepfather isn't close to the author, they argue a lot, and the stepfather hasn't tried to get to know them. When the mom calls him \"your father,\" the author responds that he's not their dad, leading to a conflict.\n\nI should consider the dynamics here. The author's feelings about their stepfather are valid. If the stepfather hasn't built a relationship or shown genuine care, the author might feel it's inappropriate to use the term \"Dad.\" The mom's reaction is harsh, calling the author ungrateful. But why is she upset? Maybe she wants the author to accept the new father figure for her happiness or to maintain a family image. However, the author's refusal could stem from real experiences of neglect or conflict.\n\nLegal or societal norms don't force someone to use a specific term. Family dynamics vary, and respect can be shown in different ways. The author isn't being disrespectful by stating facts about their relationship. The mom's anger might be misplaced, especially if the stepfather hasn't earned the title through actions. The key here is whether the author's response was rude or if it's a legitimate expression of their feelings.\n\nIn similar situations, people often debate the importance of titles versus actual relationships. If the stepfather isn't fulfilling a fatherly role, the title might feel forced. The author's response isn't anger-driven but a factual statement. The mom's reaction could be seen as not respecting the author's feelings. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
