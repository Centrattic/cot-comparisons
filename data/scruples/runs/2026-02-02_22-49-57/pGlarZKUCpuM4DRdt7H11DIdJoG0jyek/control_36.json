In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" The situation is that the parents are divorced, the mom remarried, and the stepdad isn't close with the child. They argue a lot, and the child doesn't feel a connection. The mom called the stepdad \"your father,\" the child said he's not my dad, and the mom got angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The stepfather is not the biological father, but the mom is trying to integrate him into the family by using the term \"father.\" The child's resistance might stem from a lack of relationship or respect. The mom is upset because the child isn't accepting the stepfather, which she sees as disrespectful. But the child's perspective is valid if there's no actual father-son relationship. \n\nI should think about cultural norms, but this is more about personal relationships. The child isn't obligated to use a title they don't feel comfortable with. The mom's reaction might be out of hurt feelings or wanting to maintain family unity, but the child's feelings are also legitimate. The key points are the lack of effort from the stepfather to connect and the existing conflict. The child's statement was factual and not confrontational, so it's more about the mother's expectations versus the child's reality. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
