In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not wanting to call his stepfather \"Dad.\" Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, the parents got divorced, and the mom remarried. The stepfather has been okay but didn't really try to get to know the author. There's a lot of arguing between the mom and stepdad, and when they interact, it's mostly arguments. The author didn't feel close to him. When the mom called him \"your father,\" the author pointed out that he's not his dad, and the mom got upset, calling him ungrateful and not accepting him. Now they aren't talking.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's feelings about the stepfather, the mom's insistence on using the term \"father,\" and the resulting conflict. The author is justified in feeling that the stepfather isn't his dad because they don't have a close or positive relationship. The mom is upset that the author isn't using the term she expects. But is the author wrong for refusing?\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because choosing how to refer to family members is a personal decision. If the stepfather hasn't built a relationship that makes the author feel like he's a father figure, it's reasonable to not use the term. However, the mom's reaction is also influenced by her own feelings about the relationship. The author's response was factual and calm, not hostile. The mom's anger might stem from feeling disrespected or wanting to legitimize her new husband's role, but that doesn't make the author wrong for not feeling that way. So, the answer should be B.\n"
