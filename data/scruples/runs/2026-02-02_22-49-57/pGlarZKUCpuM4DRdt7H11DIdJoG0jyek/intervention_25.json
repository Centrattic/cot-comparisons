In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" The situation is that the parents divorced, the mom remarried, and the stepdad hasn't been very involved or nice. The mom called him \"your father,\" and the author said he's not their dad, leading to an argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The stepfather hasn't really tried to bond with the child, there are frequent arguments between the mom and stepdad, and the child feels uncomfortable. The mom is upset because the child doesn't accept the stepdad as a father figure.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a sensitive family matter. The child's feelings are valid if they don't feel a connection. The mom might feel hurt because she's trying to integrate the stepdad into their lives. But the child's refusal to use \"Dad\" could stem from genuine discomfort rather than spite. \n\nThe key points are the stepdad's lack of engagement and the existing tension. The author's response was factual and not hostile. The mom's reaction might be more about her own feelings of rejection than the child's wrongdoing. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for expressing their feelings honestly. The answer should be B.\n"
