In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's parents divorced, and the mother remarried two years ago. The stepfather is described as \"OK but never really tried to get to know me,\" and there's a lot of arguing between the mother and stepfather. The author has had arguments with the stepfather and finds him not very nice. When the mom refers to him as \"your father,\" the author responds with \"he's not my dad,\" which leads to the mom being angry and not speaking to the author since.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The author's resistance to calling the stepfather \"Dad\" seems to stem from their negative experiences and the lack of a meaningful relationship. The mother's reaction is anger and labeling the author as ungrateful and not accepting. \n\nI should think about the emotional impact. The author has valid reasons for not wanting to use the term \"father,\" given the stepfather's behavior and the strained relationship. The mother's reaction might be coming from a place of wanting her new husband to be acknowledged as part of the family, but she might not be recognizing the author's feelings. \n\nFamily dynamics can be complex, especially after a divorce and remarriage. The author isn't obligated to use a term that doesn't feel right to them. The mother's anger might be more about her own feelings of rejection rather than the author's right to feel how they do. \n\nHowever, maybe the author could have approached it differently. Instead of a blunt \"he's not my dad,\" perhaps explaining their feelings could have been better. But the question is about being in the wrong, not about communication style. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's stance is based on their experiences. They aren't being disrespectful, just stating their truth. The mother's anger seems misplaced because the author isn't in the wrong for having that boundary. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
