In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" The situation is that after their parents' divorce and the mother's remarriage, the stepfather hasn't really connected with them and there's been a lot of arguing. The mom called the stepfather \"your father,\" and the person responded that he's not their dad, which upset the mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The stepfather hasn't made an effort to get to know the person, and their interactions have been negative. The person is living with their mom, so the relationship is part of their daily life. The mom wants the child to accept the stepfather as a father figure, but the child isn't comfortable with that label. \n\nIs the child wrong for not calling him \"Dad\"? Well, titles like \"Dad\" or \"Dad\" are personal and depend on the relationship. If the stepfather hasn't built a father-son/daughter bond, it's reasonable for the child to not use that term. The mom's reaction might be stemming from a place of wanting the child to be accepting, but forcing a relationship or title that isn't genuine could be problematic. \n\nHowever, the mom might feel hurt because she's trying to integrate the stepfather into the family, and the child's refusal could be seen as rejecting her new spouse. But the child's feelings are valid if there's no real bond. The key here is whether the stepfather has made an effort beyond just being a legal figure. Since the stepfather hasn't tried to connect and there's existing tension, the child's stance isn't unreasonable. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The person has a right to be honest about their feelings towards the stepfather, especially if the stepfather hasn't earned the title of \"Dad.\" The mother's reaction, while hurtful, doesn't make the child wrong for expressing their true feelings.\n"
