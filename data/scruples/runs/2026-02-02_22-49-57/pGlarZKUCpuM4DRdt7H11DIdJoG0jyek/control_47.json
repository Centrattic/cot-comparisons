In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author's parents divorced, and the mom remarried. The stepdad hasn't really connected with the author, they argue a lot, and the stepdad isn't nice. When the mom called him \"your father,\" the author corrected her, leading to a fight.\n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong).\n\nWell, considering the dynamics here. The stepfather hasn't made an effort to bond, there's conflict, and the author feels uncomfortable. Using a title like \"Dad\" is a personal choice. The mom might feel the author should be more accepting, but the author's feelings are valid. They have a right to not want to use a term that doesn't feel right. The mom's anger seems to stem from her own expectations, but the author isn't obligated to comply if it's not genuine. So the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong. They're expressing their authentic feelings, and the mom should respect that.\n"
