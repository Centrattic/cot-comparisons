In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" The situation is that the parents are divorced, the mom remarried, and the stepdad hasn't really tried to get close. They argue a lot, and the author doesn't feel comfortable calling him dad. When the mom refers to him as \"your father,\" the author corrects her, and the mom gets angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author's stepfather isn't their biological father, and there's been a lack of positive interaction. The stepdad hasn't made an effort to build a relationship and there are arguments between him and the mom. The author's response was factual, not angry, but the mom took offense.\n\nFrom a rights perspective, people have the right to choose how they refer to others. The stepfather hasn't earned the title of \"father\" in the author's eyes, given the circumstances. The mom's reaction might stem from her own feelings about the relationship and her desire for the stepdad to be accepted. However, the author isn't obligated to use a title they're uncomfortable with. The mom's anger could be seen as dismissive of the author's feelings. The key points are the lack of effort from the stepfather and the author's right to set boundaries. So the author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
