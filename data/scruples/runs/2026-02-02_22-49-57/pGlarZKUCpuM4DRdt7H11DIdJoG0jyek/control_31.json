  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not wanting to call my stepfather \"Dad\"?\nSo hear me out. In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" The situation is that the parents got divorced, the mom remarried, and the stepfather isn't close with the kid. They argue a lot, and the kid doesn't feel a connection. The mom got upset when the kid refused to call him \"Dad.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The stepfather isn't the biological father, so there's no inherent reason for the kid to use that title. The kid has valid reasons\u2014arguments, lack of connection, and the stepfather not making an effort. The mom is pressuring the kid to accept him as a parent, but if the relationship isn't there, forcing a title change might be unfair.\n\nThe key points are the kid's feelings and the stepfather's behavior. If the stepdad hasn't tried to build a relationship, the kid isn't obligated to use the title. The mom's anger over this seems misplaced if the kid isn't comfortable. Titles are about respect and how people feel, not just about legal or marital status. So, the kid isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
