In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a stepson who doesn't want to call his stepfather \"Dad\" and had a conflict with his mom over it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The parents are divorced, and the mom has remarried. The stepfather isn't really making an effort to connect, there's a lot of arguing between the mom and stepfather, and the stepson and stepfather argue too. The mom calls the stepfather \"your father,\" and the stepson corrects her, saying he's not his dad. The mom is upset, calling him ungrateful and not accepting the stepfather.\n\nSo, is the stepson wrong? Well, calling someone \"Dad\" is a personal choice. If the stepfather isn't acting like a father figure and there's tension, the stepson's resistance might be valid. The mom might feel rejected, but she's the one who pushed the issue. The stepson's response was factual, not hostile. The mom's anger seems more about her own expectations not being met. The stepfather's lack of effort also plays a role here. The stepson isn't obligated to use a title he's uncomfortable with, especially if the relationship is strained. So, the answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
