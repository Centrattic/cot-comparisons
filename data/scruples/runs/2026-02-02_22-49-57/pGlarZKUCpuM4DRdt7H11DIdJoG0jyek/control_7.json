In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" The situation is that the parents are divorced, the mom remarried, and the stepdad hasn't really connected with the kid. The kid and stepdad have had arguments, and the mom was upset when the kid didn't refer to him as \"your father.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The stepfather isn't the biological father, so the kid might not feel a natural bond. The stepfather hasn't made an effort to get to know them and they argue. The kid's mom is trying to make the stepfather feel like a father figure, but the kid resists because of their negative interactions.\n\nThe mom's reaction was anger, calling the kid ungrateful. The kid probably felt justified in their stance. But from the mom's perspective, she might see integrating the stepfather into the family as important, hence the frustration when the kid doesn't acknowledge him as a father.\n\nNow, is the kid in the wrong? Well, the kid isn't obligated to call someone else \"Dad\" if they don't feel it's appropriate. Family expectations can vary, but the kid's feelings shouldn't be dismissed. The mom's anger seems harsh, especially if the stepfather isn't a positive influence. The kid's response was factual, not aggressive. So maybe the mom overreacted. However, the kid could have handled it more tactfully, but the core issue is their right to choose familial terms.\n\nThe stepfather's behavior and the lack of effort to build a relationship are on his side. The kid isn't to blame for not wanting to label someone as a parent if that person isn't fulfilling the role. The mom's insistence might be unrealistic given the circumstances. So the answer leans towards the kid not being in the wrong.\n"
