In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA scenario is in the wrong for not calling their stepfather \"Dad.\" The key points here are the dynamics between the stepfather and the author, the mother's reaction, and the overall family situation.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that their parents divorced, and the mother remarried. The stepfather is described as \"OK\" but not making an effort to get to know the author. There's a lot of arguing between the stepfather and the mother, and the author has had arguments with him, which were not nice. The author feels the stepfather isn't nice and the relationship isn't healthy. \n\nWhen the mother calls the stepfather \"your father,\" the author responds with \"he's not my dad,\" which the mother interprets as ungrateful. The author isn't angry, just stating a fact. The mother then becomes angry and hasn't spoken to the author since. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for this.\n\nFrom a familial perspective, it's common for step-parents to expect to be addressed as \"Dad\" or \"Mom,\" but it's also a personal choice. The author has valid reasons for not wanting to use that term\u2014negative interactions, lack of effort from the stepfather, and the unhealthy relationship dynamics. The mother's reaction might be based on her hope for a better relationship or societal expectations, but the author's feelings are genuine and shouldn't be dismissed as ungrateful without understanding the context.\n\nThe mother's anger stems from the author not accepting the stepfather, but if the stepfather hasn't made an effort, the author isn't obligated to use the term. The author's response is a factual statement, not a harsh one. So, the author isn't in the wrong for expressing their true feelings. The mother's reaction is justified in her perspective, but the author's stance is valid given the circumstances. Therefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
