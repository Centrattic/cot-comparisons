In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (AITA) is in the wrong for not calling their stepfather \"Dad.\" The situation is that the parents divorced, the mom remarried, and the stepfather isn't getting along well with the kid. The kid and stepdad argue a lot, and the mom calls the stepdad \"your father,\" which the kid resists. The mom gets angry and hasn't spoken to the kid since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The stepfather isn't the biological father, and the kid hasn't developed a positive relationship with him. The kid feels justified in not calling him \"Dad\" because of the tension and lack of effort from the stepfather. The mom is upset because she wants the kid to accept the stepfather, but the kid hasn't been given a reason to do so. \n\nLegally, the stepfather isn't the biological father, so the term \"Dad\" might be a stretch. Emotionally, the kid is being honest about their feelings. The mom might be projecting her own hopes onto the child. The stepfather's behavior (not trying to get to know the kid, arguments) is a factor here. The kid is just stating a fact that he isn't their father, not being disrespectful. The mom's anger seems out of proportion, maybe because she's invested in the marriage and wants the family to present as united, but the kid's experience is different. \n\nIs the kid wrong? They're not forced to call someone \"Dad\" if they don't feel comfortable. The mom's reaction is harsh. The kid isn't being ungrateful; they're stating reality. The stepfather's lack of effort is on him. So the answer is probably B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
