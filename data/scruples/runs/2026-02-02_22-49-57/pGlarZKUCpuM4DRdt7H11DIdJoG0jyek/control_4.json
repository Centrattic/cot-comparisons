In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The parents divorced, the mom remarried two years ago. The stepfather isn't close to the child, they argue a lot, and the stepdad hasn't really tried to connect. When the mom refers to him as \"your father,\" the child reacts by saying \"he's not my dad,\" which upset the mom.\n\nNow, the key points here. The child's feelings are important. They haven't built a relationship with the stepfather, and the stepfather hasn't made an effort. The child is being honest about their feelings. The mom's reaction seems harsh, calling the child ungrateful. \n\nIs there a social expectation that stepchildren must call their step-parents by parent titles? I think it varies. Some families do it, others don't. But if the relationship isn't there, forcing the child to use that title could be invalidating. The child is expressing their truth, which is that the stepdad isn't their dad. \n\nThe mom's anger might stem from wanting the child to accept the new spouse, but if the relationship is strained, the child's resistance is understandable. The stepdad's own behavior (arguing, not trying to connect) might contribute to the child's feelings. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? I think not. They're expressing their genuine feelings. The mom's reaction is more concerning. The answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
