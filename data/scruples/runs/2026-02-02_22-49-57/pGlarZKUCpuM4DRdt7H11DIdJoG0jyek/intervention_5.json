In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" The situation is that after their parents' divorce and remarriage, the stepfather hasn't really bonded with the author. There's tension between the mom and stepdad, and the author objects when the mom refers to him as \"your father.\" The mom got angry and hasn't spoken to the author since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author's mom is trying to integrate the stepfather into the family, which can be tough. The stepfather hasn't made an effort to connect, and the author is upset about that. Legally, the stepfather isn't a parent, so maybe the author isn't obligated to call him dad. Emotionally, the author might not feel a fatherly bond, so calling him \"Dad\" could feel forced or insincere.\n\nThe mom's reaction is also important. She's upset that the author doesn't accept her husband, but maybe she's not considering the author's feelings. The author's response was factual, not hostile. The mom's anger and silence might be overreacting, especially if the author isn't the one causing the conflict. The stepfather's lack of effort could contribute to the author's resistance. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. They have valid reasons for not calling him Dad. The mom might need to address her expectations and the stepfather's behavior. So the answer is B.\n"
