In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" The user is asking if they are the asshole (AITA) for that.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The parents are divorced, and the mom remarried. The stepfather has been okay but hasn't tried to get to know the author, and they argue a lot. The author finds the stepdad not very nice and there's tension between the mom and stepdad. When the mom refers to the stepdad as \"your father,\" the author says, \"he's not my dad,\" which causes the mom to get angry and stop talking to them.\n\nSo, the key points here are the relationship dynamics. The author's stepfather is not their biological father, and they have a strained relationship. The mom is upset because the author doesn't accept the stepfather as a father figure. \n\nFrom a traditional perspective, some might think that after a remarriage, especially when the mother is involved, the stepfather might be expected to be called \"Dad.\" However, that's a societal norm, not necessarily a right or wrong. The author's feelings here are about not wanting to lie or pretend someone is a parent when they don't feel the connection. \n\nThe stepfather hasn't tried to bond with the author, and their interactions are argumentative. The author is being honest about their feelings. The mom's reaction seems harsh, maybe because she's invested in the new marriage and wants the family to be cohesive. But the author isn't obligated to call someone \"Dad\" if there's no emotional bond. \n\nIt's important to consider that family relationships are complex. The author isn't in the wrong for expressing their genuine feelings. The mom's anger might stem from feeling rejected, but that doesn't make the author's stance wrong. They have the right to set boundaries and not adopt labels that don't feel authentic. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're being honest about their relationship and the lack of connection with their stepfather.\n"
