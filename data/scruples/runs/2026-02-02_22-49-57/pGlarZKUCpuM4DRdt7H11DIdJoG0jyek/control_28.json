  "prompt": "Is the person who wrote this in the wrong in the following situation?\n\n\"\"\"\nAITA for not wanting to call my stepfather \"Dad\"?\nSo hear me out. In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" So, the situation is that the parents divorced, the mom remarried, and the stepdad isn't really close with the kid. They argue a lot, and the kid doesn't like him. The mom called him \"your father,\" and the kid said he's not their dad, leading to conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The stepfather hasn't tried to get to know the kid and the relationship is strained. The kid's mom is pushing to refer to him as \"Dad,\" which the kid is uncomfortable with. The kid's response was factual and not angry. The mom got angry, calling the kid ungrateful and not accepting him.\n\nFamily relationships are complex. The kid's feelings are valid if they don't feel a connection. Using a title like \"Dad\" implies a certain level of closeness and acceptance that the kid might not feel. The mom might be trying to integrate the stepfather into the family, which is understandable, but forcing a title can be seen as invalidating the kid's feelings. \n\nThe key points: the stepfather isn't close with the kid, there's conflict, the kid's refusal to use the title is a factual statement, not aggression. The mom's reaction seems harsh. The kid isn't obligated to use a title that doesn't feel right. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
