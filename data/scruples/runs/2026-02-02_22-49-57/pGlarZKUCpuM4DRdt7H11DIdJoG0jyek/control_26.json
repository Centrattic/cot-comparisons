In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" The situation involves a recent divorce, a remarriage, and some tension between the mom, the stepdad, and the child.\n\nFirst, the stepdad isn't really trying to get to know the author and there's a lot of arguing between him and the mom. The author feels he's not nice and they argue. Then the mom calls him \"your father,\" leading to the author saying he's not their dad. The mom gets angry and hasn't spoken to the author since.\n\nHmm, so the key points are the stepdad's behavior and the author's feelings. The mom expects the author to accept her husband as a father figure, but the author hasn't had positive interactions. Is it the author's fault for not accepting that title? Or is the mom being unreasonable?\n\nThe author's mom is getting angry for not using the term \"Dad,\" but if the stepdad hasn't built a relationship, maybe the term feels forced. The stepdad's lack of effort might be a reason why the author resists. The mom's anger might be misplaced, as the author is just being honest about their feelings.\n\nAlso, the stepdad and mom's arguments show their marriage has issues. If the relationship isn't healthy, expecting the child to adopt the new \"father\" title might be unfair. The author isn't obligated to use that term if there's no strong bond.\n\nSo, considering the stepdad's behavior and lack of connection, the author's stance seems valid. The mom's reaction could be harsh. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
