In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" The story goes that the parents are divorced, the mom remarried. The stepfather isn't close with the author, they argue a lot, and the stepfather hasn't really tried to connect. When the mom refers to him as \"your father,\" the author corrects her, saying he's not their dad, which made the mom angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author's mom is trying to integrate the stepfather into their child's life, possibly to strengthen the family bond. But the author feels disconnected from the stepfather and hasn't had a positive relationship with him. The key point is whether the author is wrong for not calling him \"Dad.\"\n\nFrom a family perspective, some might argue that the mom expects the child to respect the new husband as a father figure, especially if they're living together. However, the author's feelings are valid if they haven't developed that relationship. The stepfather's lack of effort and the negative interactions play a role here. The author isn't being disrespectful just because they don't use the title; they're stating their truth based on their experiences.\n\nThe mom's reaction is important too. Getting angry and cutting off communication because the child doesn't use a specific term might indicate that the mom is prioritizing her own needs or the stepfather's feelings over the child's genuine feelings. The author's statement was factual and not confrontational, so the mom's anger seems excessive.\n\nIn terms of societal expectations, there's no universal rule that a stepchild must call a stepfather \"Dad.\" Family dynamics vary, and respecting individual feelings is crucial. The author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to use a title that doesn't feel authentic to them. The stepfather's role is complicated by his own behavior, so expecting the child to accept him as a father figure without a proper relationship is unfair.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author isn't in the wrong. They have legitimate reasons for their stance, and the mom's reaction is misplaced. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
