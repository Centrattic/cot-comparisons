In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA story is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" First, I need to understand the situation. The parent got divorced, the mom remarried, and the stepdad hasn't really tried to connect with the kid. They argue a lot, and the author is uncomfortable with the stepdad. The mom referred to him as \"your father,\" and the author said, \"he's not my dad,\" leading to conflict.\n\nSo, the key points here: The author's feelings toward their stepfather are negative. They don't see him as a father figure, which is why they object to the title. The mom is upset because the author hasn't accepted him. The question is whether the author is wrong for not calling him \"Dad.\"\n\nI should consider the dynamics of stepfamilies. It's common for children to struggle with accepting a stepparent, especially if the stepparent hasn't made an effort to build a relationship. The mom might be trying to create a sense of family unity, but the author's reaction is based on their real experiences. Using the term \"Dad\" is a personal choice; it's not like a legal requirement. The author's statement was factual in the sense that the stepfather isn't their biological father, but maybe the mom is trying to integrate him into the family structure by using that term.\n\nAlso, the mom's anger and not speaking to the author since could be an overreaction. If the stepfather isn't acting like a father, the author isn't obligated to use that term. The mom's remarriage doesn't erase the previous relationship with the biological father. The author's right to express their feelings should be respected. However, maybe the author could have handled it more tactfully. But the core issue is about the author's right to not use a title they don't feel comfortable with. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
