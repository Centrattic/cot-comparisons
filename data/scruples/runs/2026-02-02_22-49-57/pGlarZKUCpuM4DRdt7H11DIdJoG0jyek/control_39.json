In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" The situation involves a recent divorce and remarriage. The author's mom is upset because when she called the stepfather \"your father,\" the author responded with \"he's not my dad.\" The mom got angry, calling the author ungrateful and not having accepted him, and hasn't spoken to them since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The stepfather has been in the picture for two years, but the author reports that he's not nice, they argue a lot, and he doesn't try to get to know them. The author's mom wants the author to accept and refer to him as \"Dad,\" but the author feels it's insincere given the circumstances. \n\nLegally, the stepfather is the father-in-law, but the user is asking about social or moral expectations, not legal ones. The key question is whether the author has any obligation to use that term. In many cases, family titles can be a personal choice. If the stepfather hasn't built a relationship that feels paternal to the author, insisting on the term might be forced. \n\nHowever, the author's mom is upset. Maybe she feels that using \"Dad\" is a way to show respect and acknowledge the stepfather's role in the family. But the author's feelings are also valid. They might feel that the stepfather hasn't earned the title. The author's response was factual and not angry, so maybe they're just expressing their discomfort.\n\nBut is the author being disrespectful? The term \"Dad\" implies a fatherly relationship. If the author doesn't see the stepfather as a father, using that term could be seen as inauthentic. The mom might be projecting her own desire for the family to be cohesive, but the author's boundaries are important. It's a conflict between the mother's expectations and the child's feelings.\n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole?), the community often looks at intent and the reasonableness of the request. The author's mom might be in the wrong for expecting the author to use a title that doesn't feel right. The author is not obligated to call someone \"Dad\" if they don't feel the relationship is appropriate. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong here. \n\nBut maybe the author could have handled it more gracefully. Saying \"he's not my dad\" might come off as blunt, even if not angry. Perhaps offering an alternative term or explaining their feelings more could have helped. However, the core issue is about the author's comfort with the title. \n\nSince the stepfather hasn't tried to build a relationship and the arguments are present, the author's resistance is understandable. The mother's anger might stem from feeling that her new partner is being disrespected. But the author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to use a term that doesn't reflect their actual relationship. So the answer is B.\n"
