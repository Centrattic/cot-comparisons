In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" The scenario involves a divorce, remarriage, and some tension between the stepfather and the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The stepfather isn't described as being very involved or kind. The author mentions that he and the stepdad argue a lot and that the stepfather hasn't tried to get to know them. The mother refers to him as \"your father,\" which the author disagrees with, leading to conflict.\n\nFrom a personal perspective, calling someone \"Dad\" is a significant emotional commitment. If the stepfather hasn't built a relationship that warrants that term, the author's refusal isn't unreasonable. The mother's reaction might be more about wanting to present a unified front or her own emotional investment in the marriage. But the author isn't obligated to adopt that term if it doesn't feel authentic to them.\n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of respect and family dynamics. The author's bluntness might have hurt the mother's feelings, but the core issue is about whether the stepfather is actually a father figure. The author's stance isn't necessarily disrespectful; they're stating a fact based on their experiences. The mother's anger might stem from feeling that the author isn't supporting her new marriage, but the author's feelings are valid if the relationship isn't there.\n\nI think the key points are the stepfather's lack of effort and the authenticity of the term \"Dad.\" The author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to use that term if it's not true to their experience. The mother's reaction might be harsh, but the author's position is understandable. So the answer is B.\n"
