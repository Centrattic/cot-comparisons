In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" \n\nFirst, the situation: The author's parents divorced, the mother remarried, and the stepfather isn't close with the author. They have arguments, and the stepfather hasn't really tried to bond. The mother calls him \"your father,\" and the author corrects her, saying he's not their dad. The mom got angry, called the author ungrateful, and hasn't spoken to them since.\n\nNow, considering cultural norms, some people do expect stepchildren to use terms like \"Dad\" for their step-parents, especially if the parents are in a new marriage. But others argue that it's the child's choice. The author's issue is that the stepfather hasn't made an effort to connect, and their relationship is strained. The mom's reaction might be based on her desire for the family to present a united front.\n\nBut is the author wrong? Well, the child has a right to feel how they do. If the stepfather hasn't earned that title through relationship-building, the author isn't obligated to use it. The mom's anger might stem from feeling that the child isn't respecting her new husband. However, the author's response was factual and not confrontational. The mother's reaction could be overreacting. So, the answer leans towards B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
