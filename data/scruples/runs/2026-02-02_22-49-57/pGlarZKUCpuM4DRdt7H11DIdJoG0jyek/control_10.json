In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\"\n\nFirst, the situation: The person's parents divorced, the mom remarried two years ago. The stepdad isn't close with the kid, they argue a lot, and the mom and stepdad fight frequently. The mom called the stepdad \"your father,\" and the kid corrected her, saying he's not their dad. The mom got angry, called the kid ungrateful, and hasn't spoken to them since.\n\nSo, the key points here are the kid's relationship with the stepdad and the mom's reaction. The kid has valid reasons for not wanting to call the stepdad \"Dad\"\u2014they've had arguments, the stepdad hasn't made an effort to connect, and the marriage seems strained. The mom's insistence on using the term \"father\" might be coming from a place of wanting the child to accept the new family structure, but if the stepdad isn't fulfilling the role of a father, the kid's resistance makes sense. \n\nLegally, the stepdad isn't the biological father, so calling him \"Dad\" might feel forced. Emotionally, the kid might not see the stepdad as a father figure. The mom's anger could be because she's trying to maintain a united front, but if the stepdad isn't being a positive influence, the kid's stance is understandable. The question is whether the kid was wrong to push back. Since the stepdad isn't acting like a father and the mom's remarriage is recent and problematic, the kid's refusal isn't necessarily inconsiderate. The mom's reaction seems harsh given the context. So, the answer would likely be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
