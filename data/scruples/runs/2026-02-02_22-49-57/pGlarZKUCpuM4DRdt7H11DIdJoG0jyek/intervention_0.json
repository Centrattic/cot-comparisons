In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" The situation is that the parents are divorced, the mom remarried, and the stepdad isn't close with the kid. They argue a lot, and the stepdad hasn't tried to get to know him. The mom called him \"your father,\" which upset the kid. The mom is now angry and hasn't spoken to him since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The stepdad isn't the biological father, and the relationship isn't close. The author's resistance to the title \"Dad\" might be due to not feeling a paternal bond. The mom is pushing for the title, which can be emotionally charged. \n\nIn many cases, titles like \"Dad\" carry emotional weight and expectations. If the relationship isn't there, forcing the title can feel inauthentic. The author's statement that the stepdad isn't their dad seems factual from their perspective. The mom's anger might stem from wanting the stepdad to be accepted in that role, but if the relationship is strained, the author isn't obligated to use that term. \n\nHowever, it's also important to consider family expectations. In some families, using the title is a way to show respect or integration. But if the stepdad hasn't earned that role through genuine connection and behavior, the author's refusal isn't necessarily disrespectful. The key factors are the lack of effort from the stepdad and the existing tension. \n\nThe author's response was a matter-of-fact statement, not an angry outburst. The mom's reaction of calling them ungrateful might be an overreaction. The author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to use a title that doesn't reflect their actual relationship. So the answer should be B.\n"
