In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" The situation is that the parents are divorced, the mom remarried, and the stepdad isn't very close with the kid. They argue a lot, and the stepdad hasn't really tried to get to know the author. The mom called the stepdad \"your father,\" and the author corrected her, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author's resistance to calling the stepdad \"Dad\" seems to stem from a lack of a fatherly relationship. The stepdad hasn't made an effort to build that connection, and their interactions are tense. The mother's reaction might be because she wants the author to accept the stepdad as part of the family, but the author feels it's insincere given the circumstances.\n\nIs the author wrong? Well, the title of a relationship should be based on mutual respect and the actual relationship, not just legal or marital status. If the stepdad isn't acting like a father figure, the author has a right to not adopt that term. The mother's anger might be more about her own expectations than the author's right to set boundaries. So, the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
