In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for not calling their stepfather \"Dad.\" Their parents are divorced, and their mom remarried. They don't really get along with the stepdad; he's not been nice and there's a lot of arguing between him and their mom. When the mom refers to the stepdad as \"your father,\" the kid says he's not their dad, and the mom gets angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The stepfather didn't put in effort to get to know the kid, and there's conflict in their relationship. The kid's response was factual, not angry. The mom is upset because the kid didn't accept the stepdad. \n\nIn terms of rights, the kid isn't obligated to call someone \"Dad\" if they don't feel comfortable. Titles are often personal and depend on the relationship. The stepdad isn't the biological father, so the kid's resistance makes sense given the context. However, the mom's feelings are hurt, and she might feel rejected or think the kid is being disrespectful.\n\nBut is the kid the asshole? The kid is being honest about their feelings. The mom might expect them to use the title for the sake of family unity, but if the relationship is strained, the kid's stance is valid. The mom's reaction could be seen as overreacting, especially since there's underlying marital issues. The kid isn't in the wrong for asserting their comfort level. So, answer B.\n"
