In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The parents got divorced, the mom remarried. The stepfather is described as okay but not trying to get to know the kid. They argue a lot with the mom, and when they interact, there's conflict. The author says he's not a fan. Then, the mom calls the stepdad \"your father,\" and the author says, \"he's not my dad,\" which is matter of fact. The mom gets angry, calls him ungrateful, and stops talking to him.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author is wrong for not using \"Dad\" for the stepfather. Legally and socially, you can choose who you call family. The stepfather isn't a biological father, and the author hasn't had a positive relationship. The mom might want the author to accept the stepfather for her own peace of mind, but the author is being honest about their feelings. The mom got angry, which might be her issue, not the author's. The author isn't aggressive, just stating facts. So, probably the author isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
