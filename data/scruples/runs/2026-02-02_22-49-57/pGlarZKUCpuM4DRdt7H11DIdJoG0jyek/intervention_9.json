In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" \n\nFirst, the situation: The writer's parents divorced, and the mom remarried. The stepfather isn't close to the writer, there are arguments between the mom and stepdad, and the writer feels the stepfather isn't nice. When the mom calls the stepdad \"your father,\" the writer objects, saying he's not their dad. The mom gets angry and hasn't spoken to the writer since.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to consider the dynamics here. The key points are the stepfather's behavior, the lack of effort to build a relationship, and the mom's reaction.\n\nIn many families, calling a step-parent by their title like \"Dad\" or \"Mum\" is a way to show respect or integration into the family. But if the step-parent hasn't built a relationship or is hostile, it's unreasonable to expect the child to use that title. The mom's anger might stem from her desire to have the family unit feel cohesive, but the child's feelings and experiences are valid. \n\nThe writer's response was factual and not aggressive. The mom's reaction seems harsh, especially given the stepfather's shortcomings. The author isn't in the wrong because they're reacting to their real experiences and the stepfather's behavior. The mom's expectation might be unrealistic if the stepfather isn't meeting his role. So the answer should be B.\n"
