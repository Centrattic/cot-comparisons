In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" The mother got remarried, but the stepfather and the kid don't get along well. The mother called him \"your father,\" and the kid said he's not their dad. The mom got angry and hasn't spoken to the kid since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The stepfather is not the biological father, so the kid's reluctance to call him dad makes sense. The stepdad isn't close with the kid and they argue a lot. The kid's response was factual, pointing out that he's not their dad. The mom's reaction is to call the kid ungrateful and not having accepted him. \n\nI should think about family roles. In a stepfamily, it's common for there to be tension. The stepfather hasn't made an effort to bond with the kid, which is a red flag. The kid's resistance to using the term \"Dad\" is a natural response if they don't see him as a father figure. The mother pushing the kid to call him dad might be projecting her own desires onto the child. The kid's honest reaction might have been unexpected, leading to the mom's anger. \n\nIs the kid wrong for not wanting to use the term? Probably not. It's their choice based on their relationship with the stepfather. The mom's reaction seems harsh. She's forcing a familial title that the kid doesn't feel comfortable with. The stepfather's behavior also contributes to the issue; if he's not making an effort, the kid has reason to feel that way. \n\nThe key points are the kid's right to define their own relationships and the mother's reaction being disproportionate. The stepfather's lack of effort and the arguments between the parents also play a role. The kid isn't in the wrong for stating their feelings. The mother might need to understand the kid's perspective instead of getting angry. \n\nSo the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong. They're asserting their boundaries based on their actual relationship with the stepfather. The mother's reaction is unjustified given the circumstances.\n"
