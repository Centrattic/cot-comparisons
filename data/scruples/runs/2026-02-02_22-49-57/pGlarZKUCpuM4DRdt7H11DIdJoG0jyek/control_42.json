In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for not calling their stepfather \"Dad.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The parents divorced, the mom remarried, and the stepfather isn't close with the kid. The kid says the stepfather doesn't try to get to know him, they argue a lot, and the mom and stepdad also argue. When the mom calls the stepdad \"your father,\" the kid says \"he's not my dad,\" and the mom gets angry. \n\nSo, the main question is about the appropriateness of the kid's response. The kid's mom is upset because she wants the stepdad to be accepted as a father figure, but the kid has a strained relationship with him.\n\nI should consider the kid's perspective. If the stepfather hasn't made an effort to build a relationship, it's reasonable for the kid to feel uncomfortable using the term \"Dad.\" Using a title like \"Dad\" usually implies a close, fatherly relationship. If that's not the case, the kid isn't wrong to object.\n\nAlso, the mom's reaction is harsh\u2014calling the kid ungrateful and not accepting the stepdad. The kid's response was factual and not angry. The mom might be projecting her expectations onto the kid, expecting a relationship that isn't there yet. \n\nOn the other hand, the mom might feel that the remarriage is a new family structure, so she wants the child to accept the stepfather as part of that. However, the child's feelings are valid if the stepfather hasn't made an effort. The kid isn't obligated to use a title that doesn't feel right to them. \n\nI should also think about cultural or social norms. In some cultures, using family titles is important, but in others, it's more about the actual relationship. Since the stepfather isn't fulfilling the role of a father, the kid's resistance is understandable.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. The mom's reaction is unreasonable given the circumstances. The kid has a valid reason to not call the stepfather \"Dad,\" especially when the stepfather hasn't built a relationship with them. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
