In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" scenario is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\"\n\nFirst, I need to summarize the situation. The parents divorced, the mom remarried two years ago. The stepfather isn't close with the author, they argue a lot, and the author doesn't have a good relationship with him. When the mom refers to him as \"your father,\" the author corrects her, saying he's not their dad. The mom got angry and hasn't spoken to the author since.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to evaluate both sides. The author's perspective: they have a strained relationship with the stepfather, and it's natural to feel uncomfortable using a term like \"Dad\" for someone who hasn't built a fatherly relationship. The mom's perspective: she's trying to integrate the stepfather into the family dynamic, and the author's correction might feel dismissive or disrespectful, especially if she's trying to foster a sense of family unity.\n\nBut let's consider family dynamics. Children often take time to adjust to a stepparent. If the stepfather hasn't made an effort to bond, the author's reluctance is understandable. The mom might expect the author to respect her choice by using the term, even if the relationship is rocky. However, forcing someone to use a title that doesn't feel authentic could be seen as invalidating their feelings. The author's correction was factual and not confrontational. The mom's anger might stem from feeling that her family structure isn't respected.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a gray area. But the author isn't being disrespectful; they're stating their truth based on their experience. The mom's reaction seems harsh, especially if the stepfather hasn't earned the title. The key is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author isn't being malicious and has valid reasons, the answer is likely B (No).\n"
