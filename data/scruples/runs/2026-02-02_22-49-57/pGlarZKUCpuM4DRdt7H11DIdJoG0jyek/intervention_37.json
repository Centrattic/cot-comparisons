In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a stepfather and the child not wanting to call him \"Dad.\" The key points are the stepfather's behavior, the mother's reaction, and the child's feelings.\n\nFirst, the stepfather isn't described as a great guy. The user mentions he's \"OK\" but hasn't tried to get to know them, they argue a lot, and their interactions are mostly arguments where he's not nice. The stepfather and the mother have ongoing issues, which the user feels shouldn't even be a marriage. So the user probably has valid reasons to not want to call him \"Dad.\"\n\nThe mother called him \"your father,\" which the user found offensive. The user's response was a matter-of-fact \"he's not my dad,\" not angry. The mother got angry and said the user was ungrateful and didn't accept him. Now they haven't spoken since.\n\nThe question is whether the user is in the wrong. The user's reasoning is that the stepfather isn't a good father figure, so calling him \"Dad\" is inappropriate. The mother is upset because she wants the user to accept the stepfather as a father figure, maybe to maintain family unity or show respect to her new husband.\n\nBut the user's feelings are based on real issues. If the stepfather isn't acting like a father, then the user isn't obligated to call him that. The mother's anger might stem from feeling that the user is rejecting her new partner, which could affect their relationship. However, the user has a right to set boundaries and not use titles they're uncomfortable with, especially if it's not genuine.\n\nSo, the user isn't in the wrong. They have valid reasons for their stance, and the mother's reaction seems overly harsh given the circumstances. The answer should be B.\n"
