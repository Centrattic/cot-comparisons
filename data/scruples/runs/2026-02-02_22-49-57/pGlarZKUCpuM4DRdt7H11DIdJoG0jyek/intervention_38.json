In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" The situation involves a recent remarriage after the parents' divorce, and the author isn't comfortable with the stepfather, who they describe as not really trying to get to know them and having a contentious relationship with their mom. When the mom refers to the stepfather as \"your father,\" the author says he's not their dad, which upset the mom. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author's feelings are valid in that they might not feel the same familial bond as they do with their biological father. Calling someone \"Dad\" is a personal choice and depends on the relationship. The stepfather hasn't tried to connect much, leading to arguments and the author's discomfort. The mom's reaction seems harsh, labeling the author as ungrateful and not accepting the stepfather. \n\nFrom a psychological perspective, when a new spouse enters the family, especially in a step-parent role, it's important to respect the child's feelings. The author didn't say it in anger, just a matter of fact, so intent matters. The mom might have felt rejected, but the author's stance is about their genuine feelings. \n\nLegally, the stepfather might not be the legal father, but the mom's frustration could be because she's trying to integrate him into the family. However, the author's right to choose their own terms of address is significant. There's no obligation to use a title one isn't comfortable with, especially if the relationship is strained. \n\nI should also think about cultural norms. In some families, using the term \"Dad\" for a stepfather is common, but if the relationship isn't there, it can feel inauthentic. The key is whether the author's statement was disrespectful. Since it was a factual response and not an insult, it's likely not the author's fault. \n\nThe mom's anger might stem from feeling unappreciative of her efforts, but the author isn't at fault for not having a close relationship. The stepfather's own behavior (not trying to get to know the author, being not very nice) supports the author's reluctance. \n\nSo, putting it all together: The author isn't in the wrong. The mom should understand their feelings and not take it personally. The answer is B.\n"
