In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for not calling their stepfather \"Dad.\" The situation involves a divorce, remarriage, and family dynamics.\n\nFirst, the stepfather and the person's relationship seems strained. The stepdad hasn't made an effort to get to know the person, and their interactions are often arguments. The mother refers to the stepfather as \"your father,\" which makes the person uncomfortable. When the person corrects her, the mother gets angry and distances herself.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the stepfather hasn't built a positive relationship, so calling him \"Dad\" might feel insincere. The person's feelings are valid if they don't see him as a father figure. On the other hand, the mother might feel that the person isn't respecting the new family structure or showing gratitude for the stepfather's role in their life.\n\nFamily dynamics can be complex. The person isn't obligated to use a title they're uncomfortable with. However, the way they expressed their feelings (\"he's not my dad\") might have come off as dismissive. Maybe a more constructive approach would have been to explain their feelings instead of a blunt statement. But the core issue is the expectation to use a title for someone they don't see as a father. \n\nThe mother's reaction could be about wanting to maintain family unity, but the person's right to feel their own emotions and set boundaries should be considered. The key here is whether the person's stance is unreasonable. Since the stepfather isn't fulfilling a father role, the person isn't in the wrong for not calling him \"Dad.\" The answer is likely B.\n"
