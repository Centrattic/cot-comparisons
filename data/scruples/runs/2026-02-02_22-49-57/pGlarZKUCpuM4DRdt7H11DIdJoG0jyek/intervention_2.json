In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this situation. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for not calling their stepfather \"Dad.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The parents are divorced, and the mother has remarried. The stepfather (now husband to the mother) isn't very close to the author. They argue a lot, and the stepfather hasn't made an effort to get to know the author. The mother refers to him as \"your father,\" which the author objects to, leading to tension.\n\nThe key points here are the relationship dynamics. The stepfather isn't the biological father, so the title \"Dad\" or \"father\" can be sensitive. The author might feel that the stepfather hasn't earned that title due to the lack of relationship or effort. The mother is upset because she wants the author to accept her new husband, maybe seeing it as a way to show respect or unity.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they might feel that using \"father\" implies a relationship that doesn't exist. The mother's anger stems from her desire for the family to be cohesive. But is the author wrong for not using the title? Well, the stepfather isn't biologically related, and if he hasn't built a bond, the author's refusal isn't unreasonable. It's about personal feelings and the reality of their relationship. The mother's reaction might be harsh, expecting a title without the underlying relationship. So the author isn't in the wrong; they're acting based on their actual experiences and feelings.\n"
