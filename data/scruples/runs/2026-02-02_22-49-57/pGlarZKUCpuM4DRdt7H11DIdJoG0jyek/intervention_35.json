In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about not wanting to call the stepfather \"Dad.\" The user says they're not in the wrong, but I need to consider all angles.\n\nFirst, the parents divorced, and the mom remarried two years ago. The author lives with the mom and the stepdad. The stepdad isn't nice, doesn't try to get to know them, and they argue a lot with the mom. The author bluntly says the stepdad isn't their dad when the mom refers to him as such. The mom got angry, calling the author ungrateful and not accepting him. Now she's not talking to the author.\n\nHmm, from the author's perspective, they might feel that the stepdad hasn't earned the title of \"Dad.\" If there's no positive relationship and the stepdad is distant or argumentative, it's natural to not want to use that term. The author's statement was factual and not confrontational. However, the mom might feel hurt because she's trying to present the stepdad as a father figure. She might think that using the term is a way to bond the family and show respect. \n\nBut is it the author's responsibility to call someone \"Dad\" if they don't see that relationship? The term \"Dad\" is a familial title, which can be personal. The author's response was direct, maybe a bit abrupt, but they didn't use an angry tone. The mom's reaction seems more about feeling rejected or ungrateful from the child. However, the mom pushing for a title without building a relationship might be part of the problem. \n\nThe stepdad hasn't tried to connect, so expecting the child to adopt a fatherly title without that effort could be unrealistic. The author's stance is about authenticity in the relationship. While the mom might be trying to create a sense of family, the author is being honest about their feelings. \n\nSo, I think the author isn't in the wrong. The problem might stem from the mom's expectations and the stepdad's behavior. The author's response was factual and not malicious. The mom's anger seems to be more about her own feelings than the child's right to choose the title. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
