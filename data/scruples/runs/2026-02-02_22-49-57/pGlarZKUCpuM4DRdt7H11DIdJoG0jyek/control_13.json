In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not calling their stepfather \"Dad.\" So, the situation is that the parents are divorced, the mom remarried, and the stepdad isn't great. The author's mom called him \"your father,\" and the author said, \"he's not my dad,\" which upset her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The stepfather didn't try to get to know the kid, they argue a lot, and the relationship isn't good. The author is probably feeling that the stepdad isn't a real father figure. So, when the mom refers to him as \"father,\" the author is being honest about their feelings. That seems valid. The mom got angry, maybe because she expected the child to accept the stepdad as a parent figure, especially after being married for two years.\n\nBut how much responsibility does the child have to call someone dad? It's a title, and in many cases, people don't use it if the relationship isn't there. The author isn't being mean, just stating a fact. The mom might feel rejected, but the stepdad's actions (not trying to connect, arguing) probably contributed to the child's feelings. \n\nThe key points are the stepdad's lack of effort and the existing tension. The author isn't in the wrong for not using the title if the relationship doesn't support it. The mom's reaction could be a bit harsh, expecting the child to accept someone who hasn't earned that role. So, the answer should be B, No.\n"
