In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" The situation is that the parents got divorced, the mom remarried, and the stepdad isn't great. There's tension between the stepdad and the author, and when the mom refers to him as \"your father,\" the author says he's not their dad, which made the mom angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author's stepfather is someone they don't have a good relationship with. The stepdad hasn't tried to get close and they argue. The author's mom is upset when the author refuses to call him \"Dad.\" \n\nFrom the author's perspective, they might feel that since their biological father isn't around (due to the divorce), maybe they don't want to acknowledge another father figure, especially since the stepdad isn't supportive. They might feel that the title \"Dad\" is reserved for their biological father, and since the stepdad hasn't earned that role, it's not appropriate. \n\nOn the mom's side, she might be trying to integrate the stepdad into the family, creating a sense of unity. She could be feeling that the author isn't respecting her new marriage or her choice to remarry. The term \"your father\" is a way to show that he's part of the family now, even if he's not the biological dad. \n\nBut the author's resistance might be justified if the stepdad hasn't made an effort to bond or be a good father figure. The author isn't obligated to use a title if they don't feel it's deserved. The mom's anger might stem from a place of wanting her new husband to be accepted, but the author's feelings are valid too. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author is obligated to use the term \"Dad\" regardless of the relationship. Since the stepdad hasn't tried to connect and there's existing conflict, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for not calling him Dad. The mom's reaction might be harsh, but the author's stance is about their own comfort and reality. So I lean towards B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
