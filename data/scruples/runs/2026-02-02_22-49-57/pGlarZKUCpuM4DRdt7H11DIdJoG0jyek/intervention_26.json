In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad\" or \"Father.\" The user is the one who's confused because their mom got remarried, and the stepdad hasn't really tried to connect with them. The user isn't close to him, and there's some arguing between the stepdad and their mom. When the mom refers to the stepdad as \"your father,\" the user responds that he's not their dad, leading to a conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to consider family dynamics. The user lives with their mom and the stepdad, but the stepdad hasn't made an effort to bond. The user's feelings about not recognizing him as a father are valid because they don't see a father-son relationship. The mom's reaction is anger, labeling the user as ungrateful. But is the user wrong for not calling him dad?\n\nFrom a psychological perspective, how someone refers to family members is a personal choice. If the stepdad hasn't earned the role of a father, the user isn't obligated to call him that. However, the mom might feel that the user isn't accepting the new family structure. But the user's response seems factual, not disrespectful. The mom's anger might stem from feeling that her new husband's position in the family is being undermined.\n\nAlso, the stepdad's behavior is a factor. If he hasn't tried to connect and the relationship is strained, the user's reluctance makes sense. The user isn't wrong for not wanting to use a term that doesn't feel accurate. The mom's reaction might be more about her own feelings of rejection or the stepdad's feelings than the user's right to choose their language.\n\nSo, the user's stance is based on their actual experiences and the lack of fatherly behavior from the stepdad. The mom's anger seems unjustified unless there's more context. Therefore, the answer is B, the user is not in the wrong.\n"
