In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" (AITA) post is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The parents are divorced, the mom is remarried. The stepdad isn't very nice, doesn't get along with the author, and argues a lot with the mom. The mom refers to him as \"your father,\" and the author objects, saying he's not their dad. The mom gets angry, calls the author ungrateful, and stops talking to them.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants to know if I agree. So, I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they're not comfortable with the stepdad. He hasn't tried to bond, they argue, and the relationship is strained. Refusing to call him \"Dad\" makes sense if there's no emotional connection. It's their right to choose how they refer to someone they don't see as a father figure.\n\nOn the mom's side, she might feel that the stepdad is part of the family now, so calling him \"Dad\" is about accepting the new family structure. She could be hurt that her child doesn't acknowledge him as a father, especially if she's trying to integrate him into their lives. Her anger might stem from feeling unappreciated or that the child isn't respecting her choice by not accepting her husband.\n\nBut considering the stepdad's behavior\u2014being unkind, not making an effort, and the family arguing\u2014it's reasonable for the author to resist calling him \"Dad.\" The title \"Dad\" implies a parental role that he hasn't fulfilled. The mom's reaction might be harsh, especially if she's not allowing the child to set boundaries or express discomfort with the stepdad.\n\nAlso, the author didn't lash out angrily; they stated a fact calmly. The mom's anger could be disproportionate if the stepdad isn't a positive influence. The author isn't obligated to use a title that doesn't feel right, especially with a strained relationship.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to call him \"Dad.\" The mom's anger seems unjustified given the circumstances.\n"
