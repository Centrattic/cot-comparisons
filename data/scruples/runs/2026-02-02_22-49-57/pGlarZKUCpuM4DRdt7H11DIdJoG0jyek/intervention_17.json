In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So, the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" Let me read through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author's parents divorced, and their mom remarried. The stepfather has been okay but hasn't tried to get to know the author, and he argues a lot with the mom. Their interactions are strained, and there's tension. When the mom refers to the stepdad as \"your father,\" the author responds that he's not their dad. The mom gets angry, calls the author ungrateful, and hasn't spoken to them since. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the emotional context. The author has a strained relationship with their stepfather. He hasn't made an effort to connect, and there's conflict between him and the mom. The author feels uncomfortable with the title \"Dad\" because of the lack of a genuine relationship and the existing issues. It seems like the author is being honest about their feelings.\n\nThe mom, on the other hand, might feel that the author is rejecting her new partner and not showing respect. She might see calling him \"father\" as a way to accept the new family structure. Her anger could stem from a desire for her child to be accepting and to maintain family unity.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, the author isn't forcing the stepfather into their life. They're just choosing not to use a title that feels insincere. The mom might feel hurt, but the author's feelings are valid too. It's important for family members to respect each other's boundaries. The stepfather's lack of effort might contribute to the author's reluctance. The key here is mutual respect. The author isn't being disrespectful by not using the title; they're being honest about their lack of connection. The mom's reaction might be harsh, but the author isn't necessarily wrong for expressing their true feelings. So, probably the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
