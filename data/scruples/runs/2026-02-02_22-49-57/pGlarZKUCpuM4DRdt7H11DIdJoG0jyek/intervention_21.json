In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" The situation is that the parents are divorced, the mom remarried, and the stepdad hasn't really connected with the kid. They argue a lot, and the kid isn't comfortable with the stepdad. When the mom calls the stepdad \"your father,\" the kid responds that he's not their dad, and the mom gets angry, calling them ungrateful.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The kid lives with their mom and the stepdad, but they have a strained relationship. The stepdad isn't trying to bond and there's conflict. The kid's mom is pushing for the kid to accept the stepdad as a father figure, but the kid isn't willing. \n\nThe key points are the kid's feelings and the mom's expectations. The mom might feel that the kid should respect and accept the stepdad, especially since they live together and the stepdad is part of their new family. But the kid's response was matter-of-fact, not aggressive. The mom's reaction was anger and silence, which indicates she feels hurt or disrespected.\n\nLegally or socially, is the kid wrong? Well, titles like \"Dad\" are personal and depend on the relationship. If the stepdad hasn't established a fatherly bond, the kid isn't obligated to use that term. It's about mutual respect. However, the mom's feelings are hurt, which complicates things. But the kid isn't in a position to force respect if the stepdad hasn't earned it. \n\nThe kid's response was honest about their feelings. It's not about being ungrateful but about the relationship's reality. The mom's anger might stem from her own expectations and desire for the family to present a united front. However, the kid's perspective is valid if the stepdad hasn't made efforts to connect.\n\nSo, considering both sides, the kid isn't wrong for not wanting to call the stepdad \"Dad.\" The answer would be B (No).\n"
