In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" The situation involves the author's parents getting divorced, the mother remarrying, and the stepfather not being particularly close or nice. The author objects when the mother refers to the stepfather as \"your father,\" leading to a fight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author isn't obligated to call someone \"Dad\" if they don't feel a fatherly relationship. The stepfather hasn't made an effort to connect, and the author's feelings are valid. However, the mother is upset because she wants acceptance of her new husband. \n\nIs there a cultural expectation here? In some cultures, addressing a step-parent as \"Dad\" or \"Mom\" is common, but in others, it's not necessary. The key is whether the author's refusal is disrespectful. The author's statement was factual, not angry, so it might not be wrong. The mother's reaction could stem from feeling her marriage isn't accepted, which is a different issue.\n\nThe stepfather's behavior and the lack of effort to build a relationship mean the author has a legitimate reason for not using the term. The mother's anger might be more about her own feelings than the author's right to choose. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
