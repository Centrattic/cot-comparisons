In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The parents divorced, the mom remarried, and the stepdad hasn't really tried to connect with the author. They argue a lot, and the author and stepdad have had conflicts. When the mom refers to him as \"your father,\" the author says, \"he's not my dad,\" and now the mom is upset, saying the author is ungrateful and not accepting him.\n\nSo, is the author the asshole here? Well, the author's reasoning is that the stepdad isn't their actual father, hasn't made an effort to bond, and their relationship is strained. The mom is upset because she wants the author to accept the stepdad as a father figure, which might be important for her to maintain the family dynamic. \n\nBut the author is not wrong in feeling that just because the mom married someone, it doesn't automatically make them a parent. The stepdad's behavior might not have earned that title. Also, the author's reaction was factual, not disrespectful. The mom's anger might be more about her expectations versus the reality of the stepdad's role. \n\nSo, in this case, it's a matter of differing expectations. The author isn't obligated to call someone \"Dad\" if they don't feel the relationship justifies it. The stepdad's lack of effort and the existing tension support the author's stance. The mom's reaction could be seen as unreasonable, making the author not the asshole.\n"
