In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for not calling their stepfather \"Dad.\" The situation is that the parents are divorced, and the mother remarried. The stepfather isn't close with the author, they argue a lot, and the author finds him not very nice. When the mom refers to the stepfather as \"your father,\" the author says, \"he's not my dad,\" which leads to the mom getting angry and them not speaking since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author's biological father left, and the mother remarried. The stepfather has been in the picture for two years, but the relationship is strained. The key point is the term of address. Using \"Dad\" is a term that carries emotional weight and implies a certain level of relationship. The author might feel that since the stepfather isn't a parental figure to them, using that term is insincere.\n\nBut the mother is pushing for the author to accept the stepfather as their father. The author's response was a factual statement, but it's possible the mom felt it was disrespectful or dismissive. In many families, especially after divorce and remarriage, terms like \"Dad\" can be a big deal. They can symbolize acceptance of the new family structure. However, it's also important that the author isn't comfortable with that term if the stepfather hasn't acted in a fatherly way.\n\nThe arguments between the mom and stepfather suggest the relationship is problematic. The stepfather's lack of effort to get to know the author might mean he hasn't earned the title. The author's right to choose terms of address is something to consider. Forcing someone to use a title they don't feel comfortable with can be hurtful. On the other hand, the mom might feel the stepfather deserves that respect, even if the author isn't close to him.\n\nI should also think about cultural and personal norms. Some people believe children should use the term \"father\" for a stepparent if they're married to the other parent. But others argue it's up to the child's comfort. The author's statement was calm and factual, not aggressive. So maybe they're not in the wrong for expressing their feelings. The mom's reaction seems harsh, possibly because she's feeling defensive about her new marriage or the stepfather's role.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for not wanting to use the term \"Dad\" if it doesn't feel genuine. The mother's anger might stem from her own expectations or the stepfather's efforts to be accepted. The right to choose how to refer to someone, especially in a family context, is subjective. The author's response was honest, and the mom's reaction seems disproportionate unless there's a specific family tradition that requires it. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
