In the past few years, my parents got divorced and my mom, who I live with, decided to get remarried. It's been about two years, and I'm not a big fan of her husband. He's OK but he never really tried to get to know me, and he and my mother argue a lot. When our interactions have happened, we've argued a lot, and he's not been very nice. During their arguments, there's nothing too malicious, but they clearly have a lot of issues with each other and really shouldn't even be together in the first place. A few days ago, for some reason, my mom and I started talking about my stepdad, and she referred to him as \"your father.\" I was a little taken aback. With everything going on, why should I call him that? I blurted, \"he's not my dad.\" It wasn't an angry statement, just matter of fact. For some reason, she got really angry, and told me I was \"ungrateful\" and never \"accepted him.\" She hasn't really spoken to me since. Is this justified, or am I the asshole?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for not wanting to call their stepfather \"Dad.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The parents got divorced, the mom remarried, and the stepdad hasn't really connected with the author. They argue a lot, and the stepdad isn't nice. The mom refers to him as \"your father,\" and the author responds with \"he's not my dad,\" leading to a fallout.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants my opinion. Let me consider both sides. From the author's perspective, they have a strained relationship with the stepdad. The stepdad hasn't made an effort to bond, and the mom and stepdad argue. So, the author not wanting to call him \"Dad\" is a personal choice, especially if the relationship isn't close. \n\nOn the other hand, the mom is upset because she wants the author to accept her new husband. Maybe she sees it as important for family unity, especially after the divorce. The mom might feel rejected or like the author isn't respecting her new marriage. But the author is justified in expressing their feelings if the stepdad hasn't earned that title through positive interactions. \n\nAlso, the mom's reaction seems harsh. Getting angry and cutting off communication because of the author's honest feelings might be unfair. The stepdad's behavior and lack of effort could be a big factor here. The author's response is factual, not disrespectful, so the mom's anger might stem from her own expectations rather than the author's wrongdoing. \n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author isn't in the wrong. The stepdad's behavior and the strained relationship give the author reason to not call him \"Dad.\" The mom's reaction is more about her feelings than the author's fault. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
