The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author called the friend's mom because the friend was driving under the influence. The friend was at a party, drinking and smoking, then decided to drive home. The author saw this through social media and took action. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, driving under the influence is a serious offense, especially for minors. The friend was 16, which is underage for drinking and driving. So, by trying to prevent her from driving drunk, the author was probably trying to stop her from committing a crime. \n\nThen there's the moral side. The author was concerned about the friend's safety and the safety of others on the road. DUI can lead to accidents, injuries, or even deaths. The author mentions that if something had happened and they died, they would feel guilty for not acting. That shows their intention was to prevent a potential disaster.\n\nHowever, the consequences were that the friend got grounded and lost her phone and car. The author is now being called names and the friendship is ruined. But was the author's action justified? If the friend had driven drunk and crashed, the author would have prevented a tragedy. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author overstepped by contacting the parent directly. Maybe they could have tried talking to the friend first or contacting authorities instead. But the friend didn't respond to the initial attempts to get an Uber. The author had a right to be concerned for the friend's safety.\n\nAlso, the friend's friends are upset, thinking it's just \"harmless fun.\" The author's action led to the friend facing consequences, which some might see as harsh. But again, the alternative is risking a DUI incident. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's primary motivation was to prevent harm. Even though the outcome was tough on the friend, the intent was protective. So, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
