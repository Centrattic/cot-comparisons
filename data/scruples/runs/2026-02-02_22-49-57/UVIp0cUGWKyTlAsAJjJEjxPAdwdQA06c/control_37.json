The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who called their friend's mom is in the wrong. The situation involves the friend driving under the influence after a party, and the author called her mom to stop her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the details. The friend was underage, driving, and doing dangerous things like smoking and drinking while driving. The author saw the Snapchat stories and tried to get an Uber for her, but she refused. Then the author called her mom, which led to her being grounded and her car being taken away. Now, the friend and others are upset, and they had a fallout.\n\nThe key points here are about the author's intent and the consequences. The author's main concern was safety\u2014preventing a possible accident. They acted out of fear for their friend's life. Even though the friend was upset, the author tried to intervene when she was in a dangerous situation. \n\nHowever, the author didn't confront the other people who were also doing risky things. They only targeted their friend. But maybe that's because they were close friends and more worried about her. \n\nThe question is whether the author overstepped. Calling a parent is a common way to get help when someone is in danger, especially when the person is a minor. The friend was 16 when the event happened, so she's underage. The author's actions might be seen as responsible, as they took initiative when the friend wouldn't listen. \n\nBut the friend felt betrayed, and others called the author names. The author might feel guilty because their friend was punished, but the alternative was potentially a serious accident. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a tough call. The author acted to prevent harm, which is a valid reason. The friend's reaction was violent, which is her own issue. The author isn't in the wrong for trying to save her from a dangerous situation. The fact that there was a MADD presentation that day emphasizes the importance of preventing drunk driving. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they acted to prevent a possible tragedy, even if it caused conflict.\n"
