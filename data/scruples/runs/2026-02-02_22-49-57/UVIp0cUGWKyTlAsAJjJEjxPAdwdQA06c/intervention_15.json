The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did the wrong thing by calling someone's mom when they saw their friend driving under the influence. The situation involves a 17-year-old who attended a party where underage drinking and drug use were happening. The friend, who was 16 at the time, was driving and then posted videos of herself doing dangerous things.\n\nFirst, the author noticed the friend's risky behavior through social media and tried to intervene by offering an Uber. When that failed, they saw the friend driving while smoking, drinking, and texting. Then, the author called the mother to inform her. The friend ended up getting grounded and lost her phone and car. The friend and others called the author an asshole, and the friend later punched them. Now, the author feels conflicted about whether they did the right thing.\n\nThe key points here are: the author acted to prevent a potential accident or harm by informing the parent. The friend was underage, driving under the influence, and engaging in other dangerous behaviors. The author's actions could be seen as trying to prevent a disaster. However, some might argue that the author overstepped by involving the parent directly without maybe giving the friend a chance to correct her behavior first, or without going through other channels like a parent or authority figure.\n\nBut given the context that the friend was 16, underage, and the author was also a minor, the situation is complex. The author might not have the legal authority to handle such a situation, so calling the parent could be a reasonable step to prevent harm. The fact that the parent took action, and the friend ended up facing consequences, suggests that the author's intent was to prevent something worse. The friend's anger and the social backlash from peers might stem from the shock of the consequences, but the author's actions were aimed at saving lives.\n\nSo, considering the potential danger of DUI and the author's intent to prevent harm, the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
