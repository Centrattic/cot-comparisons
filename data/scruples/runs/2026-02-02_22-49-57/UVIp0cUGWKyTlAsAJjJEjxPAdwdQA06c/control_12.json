The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author saw their friend doing some risky things at a party, like drinking and driving. The friend was underage (16 years old) and the author tried to get her to call an Uber, but she refused. Then the author called the friend's mom because they were worried about her driving under the influence. The friend's parents ended up grounding her, and now she's mad, even punched the author. The question is whether the author did the right thing.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The friend was driving while under the influence, which is illegal and dangerous. The author tried to intervene by contacting her parents. The friend was 16, so under the legal drinking age in most places. The author's actions were motivated by concern for safety, which seems positive. However, the author didn't directly stop the friend from driving themselves. Instead, they informed the parents. \n\nOn one hand, preventing a drunk driver from getting behind the wheel is a responsible action. The potential for a car accident is severe, and the author might be trying to prevent a tragedy. Also, considering the MADD presentation at school, the importance of avoiding drunk driving was highlighted, which the author might have been reminded of.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't attempt to stop the friend from driving themselves. They just informed the parents. Depending on the circumstances, maybe the author should have taken more direct action, like calling an Uber for her or trying to get someone else to drive her. There's also the question of privacy and whether the author overstepped by contacting the parents without the friend's consent. However, the friend was engaging in illegal activities, which might justify the intervention.\n\nThe friend's reaction was violent, which is extreme, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author was wrong. The author's intention was to prevent harm. The friends who criticized the author were at the party and doing similar things, so their judgment might be hypocritical. \n\nIn terms of legal and ethical considerations, the author's action could be seen as a responsible choice to prevent a potential disaster. While the author's method might have been flawed (not stopping the friend directly), the intent was to protect the friend and others. The fact that the friend's parents took action supports the idea that the author did the right thing. \n\nHowever, there's also a nuance in how the author handled the situation. Maybe they could have handled it differently, but the core issue is the friend's illegal and dangerous behavior. The author's decision to inform the parents was a way to ensure accountability and prevent harm. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
