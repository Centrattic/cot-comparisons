The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author did the wrong thing by calling the friend's mom. The situation is that the friend was driving under the influence after a party. The author saw Snapchat stories showing her drinking, smoking, and driving. They tried to get an Uber, but the friend refused and insisted she was fine. Then the author called her mom, leading to the friend being grounded and losing her phone and car.\n\nFirst, the key factors here are the legal and safety aspects. Driving under the influence is a serious offense, especially for a minor. The friend was 16 when the event happened, so she's underage. The author was trying to prevent a potential accident or harm. Even though the friend was upset and the author's actions caused her to lose privileges, the main intent was to stop a dangerous situation.\n\nBut wait, did the author have a right to intervene like that? In some places, there are good Samaritan laws that protect people who report such incidents. Also, the author was concerned about safety, given the MADD presentation at school. The friend's actions were reckless, and the author's intervention might have been necessary.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author overstepped by not talking to the friend directly first or informing someone else besides the parents. But considering the immediate danger of DUI and the friend's refusal to get help, calling the parents seems like a responsible action rather than a harmful one. The author's actions prevented a possible tragedy, even though it caused personal conflict.\n\nThe friend's reaction of punching the author is extreme, but that's her issue. The author's intention was to prevent harm, which is a valid reason. So, in conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because they acted to protect someone's safety, even if it had negative consequences for the friend.\n"
