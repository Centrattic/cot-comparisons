The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who called their friend's mom was in the wrong. So, the situation is that the author went to a party, their friend stayed and started drinking and doing drugs. The friend was driving and the author called her mom to prevent her from driving under the influence. Now the friend is upset, and others are calling the author a dick. The question is whether the author is the asshole here.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points are: the friend was driving while under the influence, which is dangerous. The author tried to get her to take an Uber but she refused. Then the author called her mom, which led to her being grounded. The friend is now angry and the author feels conflicted between feeling guilty for getting her in trouble and thinking they did the right thing to prevent a possible accident.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, preventing someone from driving drunk is usually seen as the responsible action. DUI can lead to serious accidents, so the author's intention was to prevent harm. However, the method of calling the mom might be seen as overstepping, especially if the author wasn't a parent or legal guardian. But given the age of the individuals involved (17 and 16), they might not be in a position to handle such a situation themselves.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend's actions were risky, and the author tried to intervene. The fact that the friend punched them afterward shows the emotional impact, but the author's action was to prevent a potential disaster. The friend's friends are upset because they were also involved in similar behavior, which might imply they are in denial about the risks.\n\nLegally, in many places, adults can report minors to authorities for DUI, but the author called the parent, not the police. That might be a different scenario. However, in some jurisdictions, even minors can report such situations to prevent accidents.\n\nSo, considering the potential for harm versus the immediate consequences, the author's action was to prevent a more serious problem. While the friend is upset, the author's intent was to protect her and others. Therefore, the author is probably not in the wrong. The answer would be B (No). But I need to check if there's anything else. The author did call the mom without maybe discussing it with the friend first, but given the urgency, it makes sense. So I think B is correct.\n"
