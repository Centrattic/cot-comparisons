The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who called their friend's mom for driving under the influence was in the wrong. The situation is a high school party where the friend was drinking and then decided to drive despite being told not to. The author called the mom to prevent a potential accident, which led to the friend getting grounded and there being some backlash from others.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The friend was underage, driving after drinking, and engaging in dangerous behavior. The author tried to get an Uber for her but she refused. Then, after seeing her continue to drive recklessly, the author contacted her parents. The mom thanked them, but the friend was upset and took it out on the author.\n\nFrom a safety perspective, preventing someone from driving drunk is a responsible action. DUI is a serious issue, and the author's intent was to prevent harm. However, the method involved informing the parents, which led to the friend's punishment. The friend and others are upset because they see it as interfering with their \"fun.\" \n\nMoral responsibility comes into play here. The author prioritized safety over the friend's immediate desires. Even though the friend's parents took strict measures, the alternative could have been a tragic accident. The author might feel conflicted between being a friend and doing the right thing.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author overstepped by involving the parents, especially if the friend had a right to privacy. However, given the dangerous situation and the underage context, the author's actions are in line with preventing harm. The aftermath of punches and loss of friendship complicates the situation, but the initial intent was protective.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the author's actions were in the interest of safety, even if it caused conflict. The answer should reflect that the author wasn't in the wrong.\n"
