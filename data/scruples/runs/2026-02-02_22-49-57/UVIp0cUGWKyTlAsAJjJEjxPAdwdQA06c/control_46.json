The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the person who called the friend's mom) is in the wrong. The situation involves a friend driving under the influence after a party. The author saw the friend's Snapchat stories and texts, called her to get an Uber, but she refused. Then the author called her mom, leading to the friend getting grounded and her car sold. The friend punched the author and others are upset, calling the author a dick.\n\nFirst, the key points: The friend was underage (16) and driving under the influence, smoking, and texting. The author tried to intervene by texting and calling, but the friend was unresponsive. Then the author called the mom, which led to consequences. The author's intention was to prevent a potential car accident, which is a safety concern. However, the method\u2014calling the mom without the friend's consent\u2014could be seen as an invasion of privacy. \n\nThe friend's actions were dangerous and illegal, especially as a minor. The author might have overstepped by contacting her parents, but the intent was to prevent harm. The friend's reaction (punching the author) is a separate issue. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nSome might argue that the author acted out of care and responsibility, prioritizing safety over privacy. Others might say that the author should have handled it differently, like involving authorities or a trusted adult through official channels. However, in emergencies, people often take direct actions to prevent harm. The author's action led to positive consequences (parental intervention) but also strained relationships. \n\nIn terms of legal and moral responsibility, preventing a drunk driving incident is a significant good. However, the method might be questionable. The author didn't know if the parents were aware, but the friend's behavior was clearly risky. The author's intention was protective, even if the approach was confrontational. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's main goal was to prevent a possible tragedy. While the method might not be perfect, the intent was noble. Therefore, the answer is likely B (author not in the wrong), but there's nuance here. The key is the intent and the potential consequences if the author hadn't acted.\n"
