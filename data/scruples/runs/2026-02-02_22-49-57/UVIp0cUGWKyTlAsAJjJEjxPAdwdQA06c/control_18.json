The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the person who called their friend's mom was in the wrong here. The situation is pretty intense. The user is 17, and there was a big party where a lot of underage drinking and drug use was happening. Their friend, who is 16 (or 17? Wait, the user says the friend was 16 at the time of the event, but the user is also in grade 12, so maybe they're 17? Maybe the friend is 16 when the event happened, then turned 17 later?), stayed at the party. The user saw her posting stories of chugging vodka, smoking weed, doing shots. Then the friend said she was driving, and the user tried to get her to take an Uber. When she refused, the user called her mom. The mom thanked them and took action, leading to the friend being grounded, losing her phone and car. The friend then punched the user and they became estranged.\n\nSo, the question is whether the user was in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and safety aspects. Driving under the influence is illegal and extremely dangerous. The friend was not only under the influence but also smoking and texting while driving. The user tried to intervene by calling her mom, which could prevent a potential accident or worse. The user's actions were motivated by concern for their friend's safety and possibly others on the road. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the user overstepped by contacting the friend's parents without the friend's consent. The friend might have felt her privacy was invaded, especially if the user didn't consult her first. Also, the friend's friends are upset, calling the user a \"dick,\" suggesting social backlash. \n\nBut then again, the user was trying to prevent a dangerous situation. If the friend had gotten into an accident, the consequences could have been fatal. The user's actions led to the friend facing punishment from her parents, which she resents. The user might feel guilty for the friend's punishment but also for the potential harm they might have prevented. \n\nThe MADD presentation at school that same day adds context; it's about preventing drunk driving. The user's action aligns with the message of that presentation, which is about saving lives. \n\nOn the other hand, the user could have tried other interventions first, like accompanying the friend to get an Uber or notifying someone else. But the situation was urgent; the friend was already in the car, driving while impaired. The user had to act quickly to prevent an accident. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the user's intent was to prevent harm, which is a strong point in their favor. The friend's actions were reckless, and the user tried to stop them. The consequences for the friend (losing phone, car) are a result of her parents' actions, not the user's. The user didn't cause the punishment directly; they just reported the dangerous behavior. \n\nSo, considering all that, the user's actions were in the interest of safety, even if it caused a rift with the friend. The friend's reaction (punching the user) is inappropriate, but that's her response, not the user's wrongdoing. The user isn't responsible for the friend's parents' punishment, just for reporting the dangerous situation. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
