The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who called their friend's mom was in the wrong. So the situation is that the friend was driving under the influence after a party, and the author called the mom to prevent a possible accident.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and safety aspects. Driving under the influence is a serious offense, especially for a minor. The friend was 16 at the time, so even more legally problematic. The author saw her driving while smoking, drinking, and texting, which is extremely dangerous. By reporting this, the author might have prevented a potential accident or worse, which is a valid safety concern.\n\nThen, there's the social aspect. The friend's friends and classmates are upset because they think the author ruined their fun. However, the author's intention was to prevent harm, not just to get the friend in trouble. The aftermath was the friend being grounded and losing her phone and car, which caused personal conflict. The friend punched the author, leading to a broken friendship.\n\nMoral responsibility: If the author didn't do anything, and there was a crash, they might feel guilty. But by acting, they took a responsible step to protect the friend and others on the road. Even if the friend was upset, the action was driven by concern for safety.\n\nPossible counterarguments: The author didn't try to convince the friend to get an Uber themselves first. Maybe they could have confronted the friend directly instead of calling the parents. However, the friend dismissed the advice and insisted on driving. The author had limited options and acting quickly was necessary to prevent immediate danger.\n\nLegal implications: In some places, there are legal obligations to report someone who is in danger, especially if you have a duty of care. Since they were friends and the author knew about the situation, calling the parents could be seen as fulfilling that duty.\n\nEmotional impact: The author lost a friend, but the alternative could have been a tragic accident. The friend's anger is understandable, but the author's action prioritized public safety over personal relationships.\n\nIn conclusion, while the method could have been different, the intent to prevent a dangerous situation justifies the action. The author isn't in the wrong because they acted to prevent a potential catastrophe, even if it caused personal conflict.\n"
