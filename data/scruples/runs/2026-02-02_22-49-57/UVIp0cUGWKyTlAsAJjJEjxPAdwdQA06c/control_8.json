The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author called their friend's mom because they found out the friend was driving under the influence after a party. The friend was 16 at the time (since the author is 17 and in grade 12), which I think means the friend was underage. The author saw her doing risky things like drinking, smoking, and driving, and decided to inform her parents. The friend ended up getting grounded, and now there's tension between them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, the legal drinking age is 21, so if the friend was 16, she was definitely underage. Driving under the influence (DUI) is a serious offense, and combining that with underage drinking makes it even worse. The author might have had good intentions by trying to prevent a potential accident. \n\nOn the other hand, did the author have the right to call the mom? The author isn't a parent or a legal guardian, so maybe they overstepped by contacting her. However, in some cases, people are encouraged to report underage drinking or DUI situations to authorities or parents. The MADD presentation at school the same day probably emphasized the dangers of drinking and driving, which might have influenced the author's decision.\n\nThe friend and others are upset because they see it as ruining their fun. The author's actions led to consequences for the friend, but also prevented a possible dangerous situation. The author is now feeling guilty because they lost a friend, but maybe their action was justified to prevent a bigger problem.\n\nI should also consider if the author had other options. Maybe they could have tried to get the friend to call an Uber or get help another way before involving the parents. But given that the friend refused and continued to drive, the author might have felt that calling the parents was necessary to stop the immediate risk.\n\nIn terms of being the \"asshole,\" it's about whether the action was wrong. If the author's intent was to prevent harm, they might not be in the wrong. However, maybe they should have gone through a different channel, like contacting law enforcement instead of the parents directly. But in an emergency, contacting a parent might be seen as a responsible action.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions were to prevent a potential DUI accident, which is a serious issue. While the friend is upset, the author's intent was to protect their friend's safety. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
