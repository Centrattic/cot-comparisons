The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. So, first, I need to understand the situation thoroughly.\n\nThe author is 17, in grade 12. They went to a party where things got out of hand. Their friend, who was 16 at the time, stayed. The author isn't a drinker or smoker, so they left. Later, they see the friend on social media doing a bunch of risky stuff, including chugging vodka, smoking, and then driving. The author tries to get her to take an Uber but she refuses. Then, the author sees videos of her driving while smoking, drinking, and texting. So, the author calls her mom to report this. The mom thanks them and hangs up. The friend's parents end up grounding her, taking her phone and car. The friend and others call the author an asshole. The friend later punches the author.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nLet me break it down. The key points here are:\n\n1. The friend was underage (16) and driving after drinking and using drugs. That's illegal and extremely dangerous. DUI is a serious offense, especially for minors. The author's action was to prevent a potential tragedy. \n\n2. The author tried to get her to take an Uber first, which is a responsible step. When that failed, they escalated by contacting the parents. The parents then took appropriate disciplinary actions. \n\n3. The consequences for the friend were harsh (grounding, losing phone and car), but the author's intent was to prevent harm. The friend's friends are upset because they think the author ruined her fun, but the author's action likely saved lives.\n\n4. The author is now feeling guilty because the friend got in trouble and they lost a friendship. However, the alternative\u2014doing nothing\u2014could have led to a severe accident. \n\nLegally, the author wasn't obligated to intervene, but morally, they may feel they had a duty to prevent harm. The friend's actions were reckless, and the author's intervention was in good faith. Even though the method (calling the mom) led to negative consequences for the friend, the intent was to protect her and others. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author overstepped by involving the parents without the friend's consent. But given the potential danger, this seems justified. The friend's friends and herself are upset about the social repercussions, but that's a consequence of the dangerous behavior. \n\nIn terms of legal and ethical standards, preventing someone from driving under the influence is a responsible action. The author did what many safety organizations would recommend. The fact that there was a MADD presentation the same day underscores the importance of such actions. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's action was in the right. They prevented a potential disaster, even if it caused immediate conflict. The friend's anger and physical retaliation are her own response to being confronted about her dangerous behavior. \n\nTherefore, the answer should be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
