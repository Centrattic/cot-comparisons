The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The person is asking if they're the asshole for calling their friend's mom because the friend was driving under the influence. The situation is that they found out their friend was at a party, drinking and doing drugs, and then driving. The author tried to get her to take an Uber but she refused. Then they saw her driving while smoking, drinking, and texting, so they called her mom. The friend ended up getting grounded and lost her phone and car. Now the author is being called out by others and their friend punched them.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the friend was engaging in dangerous behavior\u2014DUI is a serious issue. The author's actions could prevent a potential accident, which is a valid concern. They might have thought they were acting in the friend's best interest to keep her safe. The MADD presentation the same day might have reinforced the importance of not driving under the influence.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend is a minor (16 at the time), so the author is also a minor. The author took it upon themselves to inform the parent, which could be seen as meddling, even if with good intentions. The friend might feel her privacy was invaded, and the author didn't try to handle it through other means first, like maybe getting someone else to help or trying to stop her in person. Also, the author might have overstepped by not giving the friend a chance to make her own decisions, even if they were risky.\n\nBut considering the potential consequences of DUI\u2014like a car accident, injury, or death\u2014intervening could be justified. The author's action led to the friend facing consequences from her parents, which some might see as harsh, but it's also a reality of underage drinking and driving. The friend's reaction (punching the author) suggests she's angry, which is understandable but doesn't necessarily mean the author was wrong.\n\nThe author's guilt might stem from the fallout in their friendship, but the alternative is thinking about what could have happened if they didn't act. The community's backlash (calling the author a dick) might stem from not wanting to police each other's behavior, but the situation is about safety. So, the author's actions, while perhaps not the best way, were motivated by concern for safety. The answer probably leans towards the author not being in the wrong (B), even if the method could be debated."
