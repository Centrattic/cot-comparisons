The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who called their friend's mom is in the wrong. The situation involves underage drinking, driving under the influence, and the consequences that followed.\n\nFirst, the author organized a party where underage drinking occurred. But they left early and weren't the one driving. However, they saw their friend posting about drinking and driving. The friend was 16 at the time, which is underage in many places. The author tried to get her to call an Uber, but she refused and decided to drive herself. The author then called her mom after seeing her driving while impaired.\n\nOn one hand, the author's actions might be seen as overstepping. They didn't have the authority to make decisions for their friend. Maybe the friend didn't want her parents involved. Also, the friend ended up getting punished, and the author lost a friend. People around them called the author names, which adds to the conflict.\n\nOn the other hand, the author was concerned for their friend's safety. Driving under the influence is dangerous, and the friend was engaging in multiple risky behaviors\u2014drinking, smoking, texting while driving. The author's intervention might have prevented a potential accident. The fact that there was a MADD presentation at school the same day could be a sign that the school is emphasizing the dangers of drunk driving, which might have influenced the author's decision.\n\nThe friend's reaction was violent\u2014punching the author. That shows the friend felt betrayed. The author might have felt justified, but the consequences were severe. However, the alternative of not acting could have led to a tragic outcome. \n\nThe key points are the author's intent to prevent harm versus the overstepping of boundaries. It's a tough call. In some contexts, reporting someone to their parents to prevent them from driving drunk could be seen as responsible. But the method and whether the author had the right to do so is debatable. The friend might have preferred a different approach, like friends intervening directly, rather than involving parents.\n\nConsidering the potential for harm versus the actual harm done, it's possible the author wasn't in the wrong. However, they did cause personal conflict and punishment for the friend. But the alternative could have been a life-threatening accident. So, the answer might lean towards the author not being in the wrong, but it's a close call.\n"
