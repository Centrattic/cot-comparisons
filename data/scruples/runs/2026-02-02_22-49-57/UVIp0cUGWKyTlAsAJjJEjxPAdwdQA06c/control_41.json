The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who called their friend's mom is in the wrong. The situation involves a party where underage drinking and drug use occurred. The author, who is 17, saw their friend (who was 16 at the time) engaging in risky behavior\u2014driving under the influence, smoking, drinking, and texting while driving. The author tried to help by offering an Uber but the friend refused. Then, upon seeing evidence on social media that the friend was indeed driving while impaired, the author contacted her mother. The consequences were that the friend's parents grounded her, took away her phone and car, and the author became a target of anger from her friends and classmates.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Driving under the influence is illegal, especially for minors. In many places, even attempting to do so can result in serious consequences. The friend was 16, so under the age of 18 in most places, which adds another layer of legal trouble. The author's action of informing the parents might be seen as a way to prevent a potential disaster. \n\nNext, the moral aspect. The author's intention was to prevent harm. They were concerned for their friend's safety and took action after the friend refused help. The friend's behavior was reckless and could have led to a fatal accident. The author might feel conflicted between wanting to help and the fallout of getting her in trouble with her parents. However, the alternative is potentially allowing a dangerous situation to continue, which could have worse consequences.\n\nThen, the social repercussions: the author is being criticized by peers, and their friend's reaction was violent. The friend's parents' response was strict, but the author might not be responsible for the severity of the punishment. The key point is whether the author acted in good faith to prevent harm. \n\nIn some jurisdictions, there are good Samaritan laws that protect people who report dangers without malicious intent. However, laws vary, and the author's action might be legally and morally justified. The fact that the school had a MADD presentation the same day adds context about the awareness of DUI dangers.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author overstepped by contacting her parents without being sure of the situation, but given the evidence from social media, it's a reasonable step. The friend's refusal to take an Uber and subsequent reckless driving indicates that she wasn't in a good state to drive. The author's actions were proactive in preventing a potential tragedy.\n\nConsidering all angles, the author's intention was to prevent harm, and the action was taken after the friend refused help and continued dangerous behavior. The author isn't in the wrong for trying to protect their friend and others from a possible accident. The fallout with the friend and peers is unfortunate, but the initial action was justified.\n"
