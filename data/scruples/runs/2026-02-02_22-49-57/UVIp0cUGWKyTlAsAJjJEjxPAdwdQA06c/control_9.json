The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story did something wrong by calling their friend's mom when they saw her driving under the influence. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nFirst, the friend was at a party, was seen drinking and smoking, and then decided to drive. The author noticed this through social media and tried to get an Uber for her, but she refused and insisted she was fine. Then the author called her mom, which led to her being grounded and losing her phone and car. Now the author feels guilty because their friend is upset and they used to be good friends.\n\nI need to determine if the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). Let's break it down. The key points here are the friend's actions and the author's response. The friend was underage (16) and driving after drinking/drugs. The author tried to help by getting an Uber, but when that failed, they informed her parents. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, it's illegal for minors to possess alcohol, let alone drive under the influence. The author's actions could prevent a potential accident. However, the author didn't have a legal obligation to do so. But ethically, it's about whether they had the right to inform the parents without consent. \n\nSome might argue that the author overstepped by calling the mom, especially since they weren't a legal guardian. The friend might have felt her privacy was invaded. On the other hand, the author was trying to prevent a dangerous situation. The fact that the friend was using her phone while driving adds to the risk. \n\nThe friend's reaction (punching the author) is also a problem, but the question is about the author's actions. Did the author have the right to intervene in that way? If the author had reported to an authority figure like a teacher or police, that might be different, but calling a parent directly without the friend's consent could be seen as a breach of trust. \n\nHowever, the author's intent was to prevent harm. In a MADD presentation, they probably emphasized the dangers of drunk driving. The author's actions aligned with that message. But the consequences were the friend losing her phone and car, which might be seen as harsh. \n\nConsidering all this, the author's intention was to prevent a potentially fatal accident. While the method might be questionable, the intent was protective. The friend's anger is understandable, but the author's actions were not malicious. Therefore, the author is likely not in the wrong.\n"
