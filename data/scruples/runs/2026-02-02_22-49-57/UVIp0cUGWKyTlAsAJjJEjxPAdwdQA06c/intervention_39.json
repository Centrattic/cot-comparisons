The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by calling someone's mom on them for driving under the influence. Let's start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author is 17, at a party, and sees their friend (who is also 16) posting about drinking and smoking. They try to get her to take an Uber but she refuses. Then they see her driving while doing dangerous things. The author calls her mom, which leads to her being grounded and losing her phone and car. The friend reacts angrily, and the author is now being called out by others for being a \"dick.\"\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal age for drinking and driving. In the US, the legal drinking age is 21, so both the friend and the author are underage. However, the author's action was to prevent a potential DUI/DWI, which is a serious offense. Even though the author is involved in an illegal activity themselves (attending the party, possibly drinking), their primary action was to stop a friend from driving under the influence, which could lead to a fatal accident.\n\nNext, the moral aspect. The author is trying to prevent a dangerous situation. DUIs can lead to severe consequences, not just for the driver but others on the road. By informing the mother, the author is acting out of concern for the friend's safety and the safety of others. The consequences the friend faced (grounded, no phone, car sold) are what the parents decided, but the author's intent was to prevent a greater harm.\n\nHowever, the author's actions might be seen as overstepping. The friend might feel that her privacy was violated, or that the author shouldn't have taken it upon themselves to inform her parents. But given the potential risks involved in driving under the influence, especially with underage drinking, the author's actions could be justified as a responsible choice to prevent a possible tragedy.\n\nAlso, considering the MADD presentation at school that same day, the author might have been influenced by that, which is a valid reason to take action. The friend's reaction\u2014punching the author\u2014shows the emotional impact, but the author's intent was to prevent a disaster.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could have tried other methods first, like calling the police or another authority figure. But given the situation, calling the parent might be the immediate and accessible option. The aftermath of the friend being grounded is a consequence of the parents' decision, not the author's direct action, but the author might feel guilty for causing that.\n\nIn terms of legal liability, if the author had not acted and an accident occurred, they could be seen as negligent for not trying to prevent it. However, since they did act, even if it led to consequences for the friend, their intent was to prevent harm. Therefore, from a moral and safety perspective, the author's action seems justified despite the fallout.\n"
