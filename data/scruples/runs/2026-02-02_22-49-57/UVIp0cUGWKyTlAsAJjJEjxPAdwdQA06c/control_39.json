The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who called their friend's mom was in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again to understand all the details.\n\nSo, the author is 17, at a party where things got out of hand. They saw their friend, who was also 16 at the time, posting about drinking and smoking. They tried to get her to take an Uber, but she refused and said she'd drive. Then the author saw her driving while impaired and called her mom. The mom thanked them and hung up. The friend got grounded and her parents took away her phone and car. Now, the friend and others are upset, the friend punched the author, and they're not talking anymore.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. The friend was underage (16) and driving under the influence, which is illegal. The author tried to intervene to prevent a possible accident or legal problem. However, they didn't call the police but instead informed the parent directly. In some places, if you see someone underage drinking or driving impaired, reporting it is a legal obligation. But in others, it's up to the individual's judgment. \n\nThe author's intention was to prevent harm, which is a good motive. However, by calling the mom instead of an authority like police, maybe they could have handled it differently. But the mom did take action, so maybe the intervention worked. The friend's reaction was aggressive, leading to the loss of their friendship. The author feels guilty for both inaction (if the crash happened) and overstepping by telling the mom.\n\nNow, considering the friend's age and the situation, the author was trying to protect her. But others at the party were also doing similar things, and they're upset. The author might be in the right in trying to prevent a dangerous situation, even if the fallout was bad. Alternatively, maybe they should have called the authorities instead of the mom, but that's different from being an asshole. \n\nThe key points are: the author acted out of concern for safety, which is positive. However, the method of intervention might be debatable. But given the context of a MADD presentation the same day, it shows awareness of DUI dangers. The author's actions led to positive consequences (the friend getting grounded, avoiding a potential accident) but also personal loss (the friendship). \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because their intent was to prevent harm. Even though the friend is upset, the author's actions were responsible. The friend's actions were risky, and the author did what they could to stop a potentially dangerous situation. So the answer should be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
