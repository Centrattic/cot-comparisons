The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they called their friend's mom because the friend was driving under the influence. The user's friend was at a party, texting them about driving while intoxicated, and the author saw Snapchat videos of her driving recklessly. The author's main concern is that they might be the asshole (AITA) for getting her mom involved, especially since the friend was upset and their friendship broke down.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and safety aspects. Driving under the influence is a serious offense, especially for minors. The author's friend was 16 at the time and driving while smoking and drinking. That's a major safety risk. The author tried to get an Uber for her when she refused, then decided to call her mom after seeing the videos. Legally, there's a duty to prevent someone from harming themselves or others, so in that sense, the author's action could be justified as preventing a potential accident.\n\nThen there's the social aspect. The author faced backlash from other classmates and even got punched by the friend. The friend's parents took disciplinary actions, which the author feels bad about. The question is whether the author overstepped by involving the parents. Friends often have different boundaries; maybe the author assumed they were acting in the friend's best interest without considering the friend's perspective. However, in cases where someone's actions could lead to life-threatening consequences, some might argue that the author did the right thing to protect the friend, even if it caused immediate conflict.\n\nAnother angle is the friend's reaction. The friend was angry and felt her freedom was taken away. The author might not have considered that their intervention caused significant personal consequences for the friend, which could be why some people might side with the friend. But the alternative is that the author prevented a possible tragedy, which is a more serious outcome.\n\nAlso, the MADD presentation at school the same day adds context. It highlights the real dangers of DUI, which the author might have been more aware of, reinforcing their decision.\n\nSo, balancing the immediate consequences (friendship loss, friend's punishment) against the potential long-term safety of preventing a crash, it's a tough call. But legally and ethically, preventing someone from driving under the influence is generally seen as the right action. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
