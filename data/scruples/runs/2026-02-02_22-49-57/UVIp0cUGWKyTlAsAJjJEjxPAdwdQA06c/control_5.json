The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for calling their friend's mom when they saw her driving under the influence. Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is 17, at a party where underage drinking and drug use happened. They noticed their friend, who was 16 at the time, driving after drinking and smoking. The author tried to get her to take an Uber but she refused. Then, seeing videos of her driving dangerously, the author contacted her mom. The mom thanked them and grounded the friend. The friend and others accused the author of being a jerk, and the friend even punched him. Now the author is questioning if they did the right thing.\n\nSo, the main point here is whether the author acted wrongly by informing the parents. Let's consider the key factors. \n\nUnderage drinking and driving are illegal in the US. The friend was 16, so driving under the influence is a serious offense. The author saw her engaging in dangerous behavior. By contacting the parents, the author might have been trying to prevent a potential accident or harm, which is a valid safety concern. \n\nHowever, the author didn't directly witness the drunk driving; they saw Snapchat videos. There's a question of whether the author overstepped by contacting the parents without maybe trying other interventions first, like involving law enforcement or someone else. But considering the author's age and the situation, they might not feel comfortable calling the police. Also, the parent did thank them, indicating they appreciated the action.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend's friends are upset, calling the author names, and the friend lost privileges. The author's actions did interfere with the friend's freedom, but it was to prevent a dangerous situation. The fact that there was a MADD presentation the same day adds context about the school's emphasis on drunk driving awareness.\n\nThe author's motivation seems to be concern for safety. If the friend had an accident, the author might feel guilty for not acting. But they did act, which is a key point. The consequences for the friend (grounding, losing phone and car) were from the parents, not the author directly. The author didn't sell the car or take away the phone; that was the parents' choice after the call.\n\nThe friend punching the author is an overreaction, but it's on her. The author's action was a preventive measure. While the author could have approached it differently (maybe talking to the friend first or finding another solution), the core issue is preventing harm. \n\nIn most ethical frameworks, preventing harm to others is a strong justification. The author didn't have malicious intent but was trying to help. So, even if the method was questionable, the intent was good. Therefore, the answer would likely be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
