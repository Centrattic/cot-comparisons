The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for calling someone's mom when they were driving under the influence. The situation is a bit complex. The author is 17 and went to a party where their friend was doing drugs and drinking. They tried to get an Uber for the friend, but the friend refused and then later was seen driving while impaired. The author called the friend's mom, which led to the friend being grounded and losing her car. Now, the friend is upset, and others are calling the author names.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, driving under the influence is illegal, especially for minors. The friend was driving while smoking, drinking, and texting, which is extremely dangerous. The author tried to prevent a potential accident, which could have serious consequences. By contacting the mother, the author was trying to stop a dangerous situation. However, the method they used might be questioned. Was it their responsibility to involve the parents? Maybe the friend could have been confronted directly, but given the circumstances, the author might have thought they were doing the right thing to prevent harm.\n\nOn the other hand, the author could have considered the friend's privacy or the consequences of involving the parents. The friend might have felt betrayed, leading to the punch and the loss of friendship. But the author's intention was to prevent a dangerous situation. The fact that the friend was using a car and engaging in risky behavior adds weight to the author's decision. Also, the school had a MADD presentation, which might have influenced the author's awareness of the dangers of drunk driving.\n\nSome might argue that the author overstepped by contacting the parents without trying to handle it another way first. But in a situation where someone's safety is at risk, intervening could be seen as responsible. The key here is whether the author's actions were reasonable given the potential harm. Since the friend was driving impaired, the author's actions might be justified as a responsible choice to prevent an accident. The consequences of calling the parents were strict, but the alternative could have been a tragic accident. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong.\n"
