The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who called their friend's mom is in the wrong. The situation is about a 17-year-old who called their friend's mom because they saw the friend driving under the influence after a party. The friend was smoking and drinking while driving, and the friend's parents grounded them and took away their phone and car. Now the friend is mad, punched the author, and they're no longer friends. The author feels conflicted between saving the friend from a potential accident and getting them in trouble.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The author saw the friend in a dangerous situation\u2014driving while drunk and high. They tried to get them an Uber but the friend refused. Then the author called the mom to prevent a possible accident. The mother's response was to ground the friend. The friend's friends are upset with the author, calling them names, and the friend physically attacked them. The author is now questioning if they did the right thing.\n\nLegally, in many places, driving under the influence is a serious offense, especially for minors. The author's action was to prevent a potential DUI accident, which could have had fatal consequences. The author's intent was to prevent harm, which is a moral duty. However, some might argue that the author overstepped by contacting the parents without being a legal guardian or a responsible adult. But given the context, the friend was a minor, and the parents have a right to know about their child's dangerous behavior. The consequences from the parents (grounding, taking away the phone and car) were likely a result of the author's intervention, which actually helped the friend avoid a worse situation like a car crash or legal trouble.\n\nThe friend's reaction of punching the author is aggressive and wrong, but that doesn't reflect on the author's initial action. The author's friends are criticizing them for \"ruining\" the friend's fun, but the author prioritized safety over social activities, which is a responsible choice. The MADD presentation at school the same day also emphasizes the dangers of DUI, aligning with the author's actions.\n\nOn the other hand, some might say that the author should have handled it differently, like trying to stop the friend themselves instead of involving parents. However, given that the friend was already in the car and refusing to take an Uber, the author's options were limited. Calling the parents was a reasonable step to ensure the friend's safety. The emotional fallout is unfortunate, but the author's intent was to prevent harm, which is the right thing to do.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions were in the interest of safety, even if it led to conflict. The friend's anger and the social backlash are consequences of the author doing what they believed was right. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
