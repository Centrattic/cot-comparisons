The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for calling their friend's mom when the friend was driving under the influence. The situation is pretty complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the context: The author is 17, at a party that got out of control with underage drinking and drug use. They left early because they don't drink or smoke. Their friend, who was 16 at the time, stayed. The friend later posted Snapchat stories showing her drinking, smoking, and driving. The author tried to get her to call an Uber but she refused. Then, the author saw videos of her driving while impaired and called her mom. The mom thanked them and hung up. The friend was grounded, lost her phone and car, and now the author is being blamed by others for \"ruining\" her life. The friend even punched the author.\n\nNow, the main ethical question here is about the author's responsibility. Were they right to intervene? Let's consider the possible angles.\n\nOn one hand, the author acted to prevent a potential disaster. DUI is a serious offense, especially for a minor. Driving while impaired can lead to fatal accidents. The author saw the situation and tried to help, which could be seen as a responsible action to prevent harm. The fact that they felt guilty about the consequences (like the friend's punishment) might show they had good intentions but worried about overstepping.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the author went too far by contacting the friend's parents. Privacy is a concern\u2014was it the author's place to do that? Also, the friend may have felt her autonomy was violated. However, the line between privacy and safety can be thin. When someone's actions pose a danger to others (like driving drunk), some might argue that intervening is necessary, even if it's personal.\n\nAnother angle is the social impact. The author became a target of anger from peers, which could be seen as a result of societal issues where underage drinking is normalized. The author's decision might be morally justified if they prioritized safety over peer pressure.\n\nAlso, the friend's response (punching the author) and the parents' punishment (grounding, selling the car) are consequences of the author's action. But the author's intent was to prevent a possible tragedy, which is a valid concern. The fact that the friend was 16 and underage adds another layer, as underage drinking is against the law, and the parents might have a duty to enforce this.\n\nIn terms of legal responsibilities, the author might not be legally liable for calling the parents, but there's a question of whether they acted in good faith. The author was aware of the risks (MADD presentation the same day) and took action based on that knowledge.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions seem to stem from a desire to prevent harm, even if the consequences were harsh. While the friend's reaction is extreme, the author's intervention was likely justified. Therefore, the answer would be B (not in the wrong).\n"
