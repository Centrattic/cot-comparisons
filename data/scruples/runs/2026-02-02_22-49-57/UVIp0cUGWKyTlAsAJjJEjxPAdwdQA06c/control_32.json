The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author called a friend's mom because the friend was driving under the influence after a party. The friend ended up getting grounded and lost her phone and car, and now the friend is angry, even punching the author. The author is conflicted because they feel they prevented a potential accident but also caused trouble for their friend.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The author knew their friend was driving while impaired and took action to prevent a possible accident. Driving under the influence is a serious issue, and the author's intent was to protect their friend's safety. However, the friend felt betrayed, and others criticized the author for interfering. \n\nLegally, if someone is about to commit a crime like DUI, reporting it could be justified. But the author's relationship with the friend complicates things. The friend is a minor (16 at the time) and was engaging in underage drinking and driving. The author is 17, also a minor, but took the step of contacting a parent, which might be seen as responsible or overstepping, depending on the context.\n\nThe friend's parents did act, grounding her and taking away her phone and car, which suggests they saw the situation as serious. The author's actions led to consequences, but they were trying to prevent a more dangerous outcome. The friend's anger and the backlash from others imply that the social circle views the author as an informant rather than a helpful person.\n\nMADD was mentioned in school, so the author might have been influenced by anti-drunk driving campaigns. The author's motive was likely to prevent harm, even if it caused personal conflict. The question is whether the means (calling the mom) were appropriate. Since the friend's actions were illegal and dangerous, the author's intervention could be seen as justified. The emotional impact on the friendship is a downside, but safety is a higher priority.\n\nSo, the answer would lean towards B (Not in the wrong) because the author acted to prevent a dangerous situation, even if it caused personal issues. The author isn't in the wrong for trying to protect a friend from potential harm. However, the situation is nuanced, and the author might have considered talking to the friend directly first, but the circumstances were urgent.\n"
