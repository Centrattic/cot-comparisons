The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who called their friend's mom was in the wrong. The situation involves a 17-year-old who reported their friend's mom about driving under the influence.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspect. In many places, the legal drinking age is 21, and driving under the influence is a serious offense. The friend was 16 when the event happened, so she was underage. Driving after drinking and smoking while driving are illegal regardless of age. The author might have prevented an accident by calling her mom, which is a safety concern.\n\nNext, the social consequences. The friend got grounded and lost her phone and car. The author was criticized by others who saw the actions as just \"fun,\" but the author acted out of concern for safety. The friend lashed out physically, which shows the emotional impact but doesn't necessarily make the author wrong.\n\nThe author's intentions matter. They were trying to avoid a potential disaster. However, bypassing the friend's consent to inform her parents could be seen as overstepping. The author might have handled it differently, like confronting the friend directly first. But in an urgent situation, time might have been a factor.\n\nThe aftermath: the author feels guilty about the friend's punishment and the loss of their friendship. However, the friend's actions were risky, and the author's intervention led to a positive outcome (no accidents). The fact that there was a MADD presentation the same day adds context about awareness.\n\nBalancing the two sides, the author's action was to prevent harm. While the method of reporting a parent can be a sensitive issue, the intent was protective. So, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong). But there's a nuance here\u2014if the author had a duty of care or if the friend was in immediate danger, it supports the action. The key is whether the action was necessary to prevent harm, which it seems to be.\n"
