The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is 17 and was at a party where their friend was drinking and driving. The author saw the friend's Snapchat stories showing her driving while smoking, drinking, and texting. The author then called the friend's mom to inform her about the situation. The friend ended up getting grounded, losing her phone and car, and even punched the author. Now people are calling the author an asshole for interfering.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the actions taken. The friend was driving under the influence, which is illegal and extremely dangerous. The author tried to get her an Uber but she refused. Then, after seeing more evidence of her dangerous behavior, the author contacted the mom. The mom responded by grounding the daughter. The author's intention was to prevent a potential accident or worse, right?\n\nBut the friend and others are upset because they see it as ruining her fun and getting her in trouble. However, driving under the influence is a serious issue. The author might have been trying to prevent a tragedy. The fact that a MADD presentation was happening the same day could be a clue that the school was emphasizing the dangers of drunk driving, so the author's action aligns with that message.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is a minor themselves, and contacting a parent without the friend's consent might be overstepping. But in a situation where someone's safety is at risk, it could be justified. The friend's actions were reckless and endangered herself and others. The author's intervention probably prevented a possible accident or legal trouble for the friend. \n\nThe friend punching the author is a violent response, which is definitely wrong. The author didn't deserve to be physically assaulted. The guilt might be more on the friend's side for reacting so aggressively. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author's action was to prevent harm, which is a valid concern. The consequences for the friend were imposed by her parents, which is their right. The author's intention was to protect, so they might not be in the wrong. The friends who are upset might be in denial about the real dangers of their actions. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong)."
