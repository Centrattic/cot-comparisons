The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" question is in the wrong. The situation involves the author calling a friend's mom because the friend was driving under the influence after a party. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author is 17, and the friend was 16 at the time. The friend was at a party, drank vodka, smoked, and then decided to drive. The author saw Snapchat stories showing her driving while smoking and drinking. The author called her mom to report this, leading to her being grounded and losing her car. The friend and others called the author an asshole, and now they're not friends anymore.\n\nThe main question is whether the author did the right thing. On one hand, the author was trying to prevent a potential DUI or accident, which could have been dangerous. DUI is a serious offense, especially for minors. The author acted out of concern for safety, which is commendable. However, the friend was an adult legally (since she was 16 but in some places, the legal driving age is lower, but the drinking age is higher). The author didn't know for sure if she was impaired, just saw her actions. Also, the author didn't go through the friend first, which might have been a better approach, but given the urgency, maybe that's not feasible.\n\nThe friend's reaction was violent\u2014punching the author. That's a problem. The author's actions might have been justified because they prevented a potential disaster. The fact that the school had a MADD presentation the same day adds context about the importance of not driving under the influence.\n\nSo, considering the possible consequences of not acting versus the immediate consequences of acting, the author probably did the right thing. But some might argue that the author overstepped by contacting the parents directly without giving the friend a chance to handle it herself. But given the friend's refusal to take an Uber and her continued risky behavior, the author's actions were a last resort.\n\nIn terms of legal and ethical standards, preventing someone from driving drunk is generally seen as responsible. The friends' backlash seems immature, especially given the potential danger. The author's guilt over the friend's punishment is valid, but the alternative could have been much worse.\n\nSo, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong). The author acted to prevent a dangerous situation, even if it caused personal conflict.\n"
