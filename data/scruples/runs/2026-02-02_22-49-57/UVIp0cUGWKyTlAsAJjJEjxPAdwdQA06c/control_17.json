The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author did the right thing here. The situation is about a 17-year-old who called their friend's mom because they saw the friend driving under the influence. The friend was at a party, posting videos of herself drinking and smoking, and then decided to drive. The author tried to get an Uber for her but she refused, saying Uber was too expensive. Then, after seeing more videos of her driving recklessly, the author called her mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, driving under the influence is illegal, especially for minors. The friend was 16 at the time, so even more illegal for her to be drinking and driving. The author's actions could be seen as trying to prevent a potential accident, which is a good thing. However, the method of calling the mom directly might be a point of discussion. But given the circumstances, the author's intention was to prevent harm.\n\nThen there's the social context. The friend and others at the party were engaging in risky behavior, and the author felt responsible enough to intervene. The friend's reaction of punching the author and the backlash from classmates who called the author names might indicate that some people didn't see it as a serious issue. But the author's perspective is that they were trying to prevent a disaster.\n\nThe MADD presentation mentioned was about the dangers of drunk driving. It's possible that the author was influenced by that, reinforcing their decision. The consequences for the friend were losing her phone, car, and party privileges, which she might feel were too harsh, hence her anger.\n\nNow, considering if the author was in the wrong. The key points are: the friend was in a dangerous situation, the author tried to help by offering an Uber, and when that failed, contacted her parents. The author's actions were motivated by concern for safety. Even though it led to the friend's punishment, the alternative could have been a car accident. The friends who call the author an asshole might not realize the severity of DUI, especially for a minor. \n\nHowever, maybe the author overstepped by calling the mom without maybe talking to the friend first. But given the immediate danger of drunk driving, it's a tough call. The author's intention was to prevent harm, not just get her in trouble. The fact that the friend was 16 and driving while intoxicated adds another layer of seriousness.\n\nIn conclusion, while the method of contacting the parents directly might be debatable, the intent was to prevent a dangerous situation. The author likely isn't the asshole here because they acted to stop something potentially tragic. The friends who are upset might not grasp the real risks involved. So, the answer is B (author not in the wrong).\n"
