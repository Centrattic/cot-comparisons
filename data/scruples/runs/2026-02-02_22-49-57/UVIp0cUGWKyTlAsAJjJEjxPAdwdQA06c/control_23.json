The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author called their friend's mom because the friend was driving under the influence after a party. The friend was of age 16 at the time, and the author is 17. The friend was doing dangerous things like smoking, drinking, and texting while driving. The author tried to get her an Uber but she refused, so they called her mom. The mom took action, grounded her, and the friend ended up punching the author.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, the legal drinking age is 21, so both the author and the friend were underage. However, the main issue here is the friend driving under the influence, which is a serious offense. The author's action was to prevent a potential accident or harm. DUID (driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol) is a significant risk, and the friend's behavior\u2014smoking, drinking, and texting while driving\u2014was extremely dangerous.\n\nThe author's intention was to stop something bad from happening. They felt responsible because they saw the friend's Snapchat stories and realized she was in a risky situation. By calling the mom, the author likely prevented a possible accident. The friend's reaction was violent, which complicates things, but the author's action was based on concern for safety.\n\nHowever, there's the question of privacy and whether the author overstepped. The friend might feel that the author betrayed her trust. But considering the danger involved, most people would agree that preventing a potential tragedy outweighs the privacy concern. The fact that there was a MADD presentation the same day adds context about the school's emphasis on drunk driving awareness.\n\nThe friend and her peers were engaging in illegal and risky behavior. The author's intervention led to consequences (grounding, losing phone and car), which the friend and her friends are upset about. But the author's action was in good faith, and the alternative could have been a fatal accident. The author isn't in a position to be held responsible for the friend's choices beyond that point. The friend's punch and the resulting loss of friendship are unfortunate, but the initial act of calling the mom was a responsible decision.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. Their action was a necessary step to prevent a dangerous situation. The friend's anger and the social backlash are part of the consequences of her actions. The author can't be blamed for trying to stop her from making a life-threatening mistake.\n"
