The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author is a 17-year-old in grade 12. They went to a party where there was underage drinking and drug use. They left early, but their 16-year-old friend stayed. The author saw the friend's social media stories where she was chugging vodka, smoking, and doing shots. They tried to get her to call an Uber but she refused. Then the author saw videos on Snapchat of her driving while smoking, drinking, and texting. The author called the friend's mom to report this. The mom thanked them but the friend was angry and ended up getting grounded. The friend's parents took away her phone and car. The author now feels guilty because friends are calling them a jerk, and the friend punched them. The author is conflicted between feeling they did the right thing for safety versus causing trouble for their friend.\n\nFirst, the key issue here is whether the author was justified in contacting the friend's mother. Underage drinking and driving is a serious issue. Driving under the influence (DUI) is dangerous and illegal. The friend was 16 at the time, so even more illegal. The author was trying to prevent a potential accident or harm, which is a valid concern. MADD (Mothers Against Drunk Driving) was mentioned in the school the same day, which emphasizes the importance of preventing underage drinking and DUI.\n\nHowever, the author's actions led to the friend being grounded and losing her phone and car. The author is now being criticized by peers and the friend is angry. The question is whether the author overstepped by contacting the parent instead of, say, contacting law enforcement or another authority figure. But considering the author's age, they might not have known the best course of action. In some cases, reporting underage DUI is a legal duty, but depending on the jurisdiction, there might be different expectations.\n\nAnother angle is friendship. The author was trying to help a friend in a dangerous situation. While the friend felt betrayed, the author's intention was protective. However, the method of contacting the parent might have been harsh. Maybe the author could have tried to get help another way first, like calling 911 if there was immediate danger. But given the situation, the author might have thought contacting the parent was the best way to stop the friend from driving drunk.\n\nThe friend's actions were extremely risky. The author had a moral obligation to prevent harm. Even though it caused a rift in their friendship, the author's intention was to prevent a possible tragedy. However, the author could also be criticized for not involving the right authorities if that was required. But since it's a personal account, the author might not have known what the correct legal action was.\n\nIn terms of the aftermath, the friend reacted violently by punching the author. That could be seen as the friend's fault, but the author might not be responsible for that reaction. The author's action was to protect someone, even if the friend resented it. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author was trying to prevent a dangerous situation. The action taken might have been a judgment call, but given the potential for harm, the author is probably not in the wrong. The answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
