The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the author called their friend's mom because the friend was driving under the influence after a party. The friend was 16 at the time, and the author is 17. The friend was drinking, smoking, and driving, which the author saw on social media.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. In the US, the legal drinking age is 21, so even if the friend was 16, she couldn't legally drink. Also, driving under the influence is a serious offense. The author saw clear evidence of dangerous behavior and took action by contacting the friend's mom. That seems like a responsible thing to do, especially given that the friend was planning to drive while impaired.\n\nThe author mentions that they tried to get the friend to use Uber but she refused. Then, after seeing more videos of her driving while impaired, the author took the step of calling her mom. The friend's parents did take action, grounding her and taking her car, which probably prevented her from driving while under the influence in the future.\n\nNow, some might argue that the author overstepped by contacting the parents, but given the potential danger\u2014DUI can lead to accidents, injuries, or deaths\u2014preventing that seems justified. The friend's reaction was violent, punching the author, which shows that she felt wronged. However, the author's intention was to prevent a possible tragedy, not just to get her in trouble.\n\nThe other students were also engaging in risky behavior, which might have led to peer pressure, but that doesn't justify the friend's actions. The author's actions could have saved lives, even if it caused immediate conflict. The friend's loss of her car and phone was a consequence of her parents' discipline, not directly the author's doing. The author's guilt about the friend's punishment might be misplaced, as the parents made that decision.\n\nIn the MADD presentation, the school was likely emphasizing the dangers of drunk driving, which the author's action aligns with. The author's actions are in line with the message of such campaigns. The friend's friends are upset because they also engage in similar behavior, so they might be in denial about the risks.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's intention was to prevent a potential disaster. Even though it caused a personal rift, the action was taken to protect someone's life. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
