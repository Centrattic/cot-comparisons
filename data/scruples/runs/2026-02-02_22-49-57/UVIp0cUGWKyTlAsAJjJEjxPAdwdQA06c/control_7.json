The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who called their friend's mom is in the wrong. The situation involves a teenager who was at a party, saw their friend driving under the influence, and decided to call the mom. The friend got into trouble, and now the author is feeling conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The friend was driving while smoking, drinking, and texting. That's dangerous and illegal. The author tried to get an Uber for her but she refused. Then they saw Snapchat stories confirming the DUID behavior. The author called her mom, which led to her being grounded and losing her car. Now, the friend is angry and even punched the author, and their friendship is ruined.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, the author's intention was to prevent a possible accident, which is a serious and potentially life-threatening situation. DUID is a major offense, and by informing the parents, the author was trying to prevent harm. However, the method of calling her mom without the friend's consent could be seen as an invasion of privacy. But the alternative is letting the friend drive dangerously, which is also a big problem.\n\nThe friend and others are upset because they view it as ruining their fun, but the author was prioritizing safety. The MADD presentation at school the same day adds context, as it's about the dangers of drunk driving. The author might have been influenced by that presentation to take action.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't try to confront the friend in person or involve a trusted adult first. But given the urgency of the situation (someone about to drive impaired), the call to the mom might be the best option. The consequences for the friend were severe, but the author's action was motivated by concern for safety. \n\nIn terms of right vs. wrong, the action is understandable as a protective measure. The author isn't legally responsible for the friend's actions, but they acted in what they believed was a responsible way. The fact that the friend reacted violently might indicate that the action was necessary. So, the answer is likely B (not in the wrong).\n"
