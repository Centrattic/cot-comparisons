The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong for calling their friend's mom when they saw the friend driving under the influence. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend was at a party, drinking and smoking, and then decided to drive. The author tried to stop her by offering an Uber, but she refused. Then, the author saw her driving while using her phone, drinking, and smoking. Concerned, the author contacted the friend's mom. The mom took action, leading to the friend being grounded and losing her phone and car. The friend and others called the author an asshole, and there was a physical altercation.\n\nNow, the key points here are about responsibility and the potential consequences of the friend's actions. Driving under the influence is a serious issue. If the friend had an accident, it could lead to severe injuries or death. The author was trying to prevent a possible tragedy. On the other hand, the author went behind the friend's back to inform the parents, which might have been a breach of trust. However, the friend was making a dangerous decision that could affect others too.\n\nThe friend's reaction is also important. She punched the author, which is a violent response. The author's intentions were to prevent harm, even if the method involved tattling. The author's actions, while perhaps invading the friend's privacy, were aimed at preventing a life-threatening situation. The fact that the parents took strict measures shows they saw the danger as well. \n\nThere's a balance between respecting privacy and preventing harm. In some cases, people might argue that the author overstepped, but given the severity of drunk driving, the author's actions could be seen as justified. The friend's anger and the others' judgment might stem from their own risky behavior and fear of consequences. \n\nI think the author was trying to do the right thing by prioritizing safety over friendship. The guilt about causing trouble with the parents is valid, but the greater good of preventing a potential accident might outweigh that. The author isn't in the wrong here.\n"
