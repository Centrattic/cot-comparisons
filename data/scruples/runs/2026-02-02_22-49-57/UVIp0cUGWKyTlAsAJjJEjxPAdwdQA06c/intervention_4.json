The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the person who called their friend's mom is in the wrong. The situation involves underage drinking, driving under the influence, and the consequences that followed.\n\nFirst, the author is 17 and went to a party where things got out of hand. They left early but later saw their 16-year-old friend doing risky stuff\u2014chugging vodka, smoking, and driving. The friend was planning to drive home, which is dangerous. The author tried to help by offering an Uber but was ignored. Then, after seeing more evidence of the friend driving while intoxicated, the author contacted her mom. The mom responded but didn't take any action that night. The friend ended up getting grounded, losing her phone and car, and even physically attacked the author. Now, the author is feeling conflicted: guilty about getting her in trouble but also worried about what could have happened if they didn't act.\n\nSo, the key points here are: underage drinking, DUI, the author's attempt to prevent a dangerous situation, and the fallout. Legally, driving under the influence is a serious offense, especially with minors. The author's action was to prevent a potential accident or harm. However, some might argue that the author overstepped by involving the parents without the friend's consent. But given the risk of DUI, especially when the friend was also using a phone and smoking while driving, the author's concern seems valid.\n\nIn many cases, reporting such dangerous behavior is considered responsible. The author acted out of concern for safety, which is a noble intent. The consequences were harsh, but the alternative could have been much worse. The friend's reaction is extreme, but that doesn't negate the author's right to act in a life-threatening situation. Also, considering the MADD presentation at school, it's possible that the school was emphasizing the dangers of DUI, which the author took seriously. \n\nOn the other hand, some might say that the author should have handled it differently, like contacting a responsible adult or law enforcement. But in the moment, calling the parent was a direct way to address the immediate risk. The author wasn't sure if the parents would act, but they did inform them, which led to the friend being grounded. Even though the friend is upset, the author's actions were aimed at preventing harm, which is a strong point in their favor.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions were driven by a genuine concern for safety and the prevention of potential tragedy. While the consequences were severe, the alternative of doing nothing could have been far worse. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
