The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for calling their friend's mom when they saw her driving under the influence. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author is 17, and their friend was 16 at the time. They attended a party that got big, and the friend stayed. The author saw videos of her drinking and smoking, then driving. They tried to get her to take an Uber, but she refused. Then the author called her mom.\n\nSo, the key points here are: DUI is a serious issue. The friend was underage and driving after drinking and using drugs. The author tried to intervene, which shows concern for her safety. However, the friend ended up getting grounded and lost her car. Now the friend and others are upset, and they've stopped being friends.\n\nThe author is conflicted because they feel guilty both for not acting if something happened and for getting her in trouble. The question is whether the author was wrong.\n\nLegally, in many places, if someone knows someone is about to drive under the influence, they have a responsibility to stop them. Calling the parent could be seen as a responsible action to prevent a potential accident. The author acted to prevent a dangerous situation, even if the consequences were negative for the friend.\n\nHowever, maybe the author could have handled it differently, like contacting the authorities instead of the parent. But since the parent picked up the phone and the situation was resolved without incident, the author's intention was to prevent harm.\n\nThe friends who are upset might not understand the severity of DUI, especially under the influence of drugs and alcohol. The fact that there was a MADD presentation the same day emphasizes the importance of the issue.\n\nSo, the author is not in the wrong. They acted to prevent a potential tragedy, even though it led to conflict. The friend's reaction and the others' anger might stem from not recognizing the seriousness of the situation. The author's actions were in good faith to protect their friend's safety, which is commendable.\n"
