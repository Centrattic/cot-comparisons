The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did the right thing by calling the friend's mom when she was driving under the influence. \n\nFirst, the scenario: The author is 17, at a party where things got out of hand. The friend, who is 16, stayed and was seen drinking and smoking. The author tried to get her to call an Uber but she refused. Then, the author sees videos of her driving while doing dangerous things like smoking and texting. So he calls her mom to report this.\n\nThe key points here are the potential risk of DUI and the consequences. The author's action led to the friend getting grounded and losing her car, but the friend and others are upset. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants confirmation.\n\nFrom a safety perspective, driving under the influence is extremely dangerous. The author is trying to prevent a possible accident or death. Even though the friend was upset and there are social repercussions, the author's intention was to prevent harm. \n\nHowever, calling a parent without the friend's consent might be seen as overstepping by some. But given the severity of the situation\u2014potential DUI and the fact that the friend was under 18\u2014it's a responsible action. The fact that the school had a MADD presentation that day adds context about the awareness of DUI risks.\n\nThe friend's reaction (punching the author) and others calling the author names suggest that the social circle values their freedom over safety. But legally and ethically, preventing a friend from making a life-threatening mistake is a valid concern. \n\nThe author might feel guilty for getting the friend in trouble, but the alternative is potentially causing a fatal accident. The moral dilemma is between personal responsibility and peer pressure. In this case, the author chose responsibility, which is the right decision even if it caused immediate conflict.\n"
