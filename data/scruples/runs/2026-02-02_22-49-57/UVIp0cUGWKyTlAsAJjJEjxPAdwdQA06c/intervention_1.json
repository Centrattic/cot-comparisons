The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this AITA (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong for calling their friend's mom when the friend was driving under the influence. The situation is a bit complex.\n\nSo, the setup is a high school party that got out of hand with a lot of drug and alcohol use. The author, who is 17, left early because they don't smoke or drink. Their friend, who was 16 at the time, stayed. The author noticed the friend's Snapchat stories showing her drinking, smoking, and driving. They tried to get her to call an Uber but she didn't respond. Then the author called her mom. The friend got grounded, lost her phone and car, and now the author is being called names and the friend punched them. The author is conflicted between feeling they did the right thing to prevent a potential accident and regret over the consequences for their friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and safety aspects. The friend was 16, so under the age of 18, which means she's a minor. Driving under the influence (DUI) is a serious offense, especially for a minor. The author's actions could have prevented a dangerous situation. The MADD presentation at school the same day might have reinforced the importance of this issue.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is a peer, not a parent or authority figure. The friend might have felt that her privacy was violated by the author contacting her mom. The social consequences, like losing her phone and car, were decided by her parents, but the friend is upset with the author. The question is whether the author overstepped by involving the parents.\n\nLegally, in many places, it's not illegal for a minor to call a parent if they believe someone is in danger. The author's intent was to prevent harm, which is a moral duty. However, the method of contacting the parents without knowing the full context could be seen as an invasion of privacy. The friend might have been embarrassed or felt betrayed, leading to the conflict.\n\nThe friend's reaction, including punching the author, is clearly wrong. But the author's actions were aimed at preventing a potentially life-threatening situation. The key points here are the intent to protect safety versus the breach of trust. The author might have done the right thing in terms of safety but damaged a friendship. \n\nIn the AITA context, the community usually evaluates both the action and the intent. If the action was to prevent a serious accident, even if it led to social consequences, the author is often seen as not in the wrong. The fact that the friend is now avoiding them and acting aggressively is on her, not the author. The author's guilt is more about the friendship fallout rather than the actual deed.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They prioritized safety and followed up on a MADD presentation, which is commendable. The friend's actions and the reactions of others seem to be the problem here, not the author's intervention.\n"
