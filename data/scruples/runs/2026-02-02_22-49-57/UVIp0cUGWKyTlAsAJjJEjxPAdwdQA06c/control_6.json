The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did the wrong thing by calling someone's mom when they saw their friend driving under the influence.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author is 17 and not into drinking or smoking. They left a party early. Their friend, who was 16 at the time, stayed and started drinking and smoking. The author tried to get her to take an Uber but she refused. Then, the author saw her driving while smoking, drinking, and texting on Snapchat. So the author called her mom to report this.\n\nThe main issue here is underage drinking and driving. The friend was 16, which is underage in many places. The author's action was to prevent a potential accident. If the friend had crashed, it could have been fatal. The author was trying to protect her safety.\n\nHowever, the consequences were that the friend got grounded and lost her car. The friends and classmates called the author a jerk. The friend even punched the author. The author feels conflicted because they wanted to help but caused trouble.\n\nLegally, underage drinking and driving are serious. By reporting it, the author might have done the right thing from a safety perspective. But maybe they overstepped by contacting the parent directly without trying other options first, like calling the police or a responsible adult. Also, the friend's reaction was violent, which complicates things.\n\nBut considering the potential danger (DUI leading to accidents), the author's intention was to prevent harm. The fact that the school had a MADD presentation the same day adds context about the importance of this issue. So, the author's actions were meant to prevent something worse. The friend's punishment was from the parents, not legal consequences, which might be why the author feels guilty.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have handled it differently, like contacting authorities instead of the parent. But given the situation, the author did act to protect their friend, which is a positive intent.\n\nSo, the answer is likely B (No), because the author was trying to prevent a dangerous situation, even if it led to unintended consequences. The main wrongdoer is the friend for underage drinking and driving, not the author for trying to help.\n"
