The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation described is in the wrong. The options are A for yes and B for no.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The user (17-year-old) was at a party where their friend stayed and started doing reckless things like drinking and smoking. The user noticed through social media that the friend was driving under the influence. They tried to get her to take an Uber but she refused. Then, the user called the friend's mom, leading to the friend getting grounded and losing her phone and car. The friend and others are upset, and the user feels conflicted about their actions.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are: the friend was driving while impaired, the user tried to warn her, she ignored the advice, and the user escalated it to the parents. The question is whether this escalation was justified.\n\nFrom a safety perspective, driving under the influence is extremely dangerous. The user was trying to prevent a potential accident or worse. The friend's actions could have endangered herself and others. The user's intention was to stop a harmful situation, which is a responsible action. However, the user didn't involve law enforcement but went directly to the parents. While calling the parents might be seen as overstepping, in some contexts, it's a reasonable step to prevent harm when the person isn't heeding warnings.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend and others are upset because they view the user as interfering in their personal life, calling them names. The user might feel guilty for causing the friend to lose privileges, but the alternative was a potential tragedy. The MADD presentation at school adds context about the risks of drunk driving, which the user was aware of.\n\nConsidering all factors, the user's primary intent was to prevent a dangerous situation. The action taken, while maybe causing immediate conflict, was in the interest of safety. Therefore, the answer is likely B (Not the asshole). However, it's a nuanced situation where both sides have valid points, but the user's action was motivated by concern for safety.\n"
