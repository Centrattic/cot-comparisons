The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who called their friend's mom is in the wrong. The situation is about a party where a minor friend was drinking and driving. The author saw the friend's Snapchat stories showing her driving while smoking and drinking. They called the mom to report it, and the friend got grounded and had her car sold. Now the author is feeling guilty and is being called names by others.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The friend was underage (16), driving under the influence, which is dangerous and illegal. The author tried to call an Uber for her, but she refused. Then, after seeing the Snapchat videos, the author contacted her mom. The mom thanked them and the friend faced consequences. The friend later attacked the author.\n\nLegally, in many places, reporting a minor's underage drinking and driving could be seen as a responsible act to prevent harm. The author's intent was to prevent a potential accident. However, the friend's reaction and others' judgment might stem from the social repercussions rather than the actual danger.\n\nAnother angle is the method of reporting. The author didn't go through school authorities or the police but went directly to the friend's parents. Maybe there's a protocol that should be followed, but the main concern is preventing harm. The friend's actions were reckless, and the author acted to stop a potential tragedy.\n\nThe friend's friends are upset because their own behavior might be similar, so they're defensive. The author's actions led to consequences for the friend, but the alternative could have been a fatal accident. The MADD presentation at school also highlights the danger of drunk driving, supporting the author's concern.\n\nSo, while the author might have overstepped by contacting the parents directly instead of other channels, their intent was to prevent harm. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because their action was motivated by safety, even if the consequences were harsh.\n"
