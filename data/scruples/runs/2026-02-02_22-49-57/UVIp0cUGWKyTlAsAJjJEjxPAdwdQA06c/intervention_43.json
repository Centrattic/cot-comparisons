The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the person who called their friend's mom was in the wrong. The situation involves a party where underage drinking and drug use are happening, and the friend was driving under the influence. The author saw the friend's Snapchat stories showing her driving while doing dangerous things and decided to call the mom to prevent a potential accident.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. Since the friend was underage (16) and driving under the influence, that's a serious offense. The author was trying to stop a dangerous situation, which might be a duty to prevent harm. However, the friend didn't have a driver's license yet if she's 16 in some places, but the story says she had a car, so maybe she does. Either way, DUI is illegal for minors.\n\nThen there's the social aspect. The friend and her friends were doing drugs and drinking, and the author felt responsible to intervene. The key points here are intent. The author's intention was to prevent harm, not just to get her in trouble. Even though the friend got grounded and lost her car, the author's action was to stop a potential accident. \n\nBut there's also the fallout. The friend punched the author, and others called the author names. People can argue that the author overstepped by contacting the parents without the friend's consent. However, in many places, there's a legal duty to report underage drinking and DUI, especially if you're a responsible party. \n\nThe MADD presentation at school adds context, suggesting that the school environment was emphasizing the dangers of drunk driving, so the author might have felt more compelled to act. \n\nThe question is whether the action was right. Legally, the author might have done the right thing. Socially, it's more complicated because the friend's friends are upset. But the author's action was to prevent a serious accident, which is a strong point in their favor. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could have tried to call an Uber or involve another authority first. But since the friend refused to take an Uber and insisted on driving, the author's next best option might have been to inform the parents. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's intent was to prevent harm, which is a valid reason. Even though it caused personal conflict, the legal and safety aspects suggest the author was not in the wrong.\n"
