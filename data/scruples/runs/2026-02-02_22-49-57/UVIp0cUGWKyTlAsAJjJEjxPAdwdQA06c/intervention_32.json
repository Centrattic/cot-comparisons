The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who called their friend's mom was in the wrong. The situation involves a friend driving under the influence after attending a party. The person in question saw their friend on social media doing things like chugging vodka, smoking, and then driving. They tried to get an Uber for her but she refused, insisting she could drive. Then the person called her mom to prevent a potential accident. The friend ended up being grounded, and now the person feels guilty because they lost their friend and got bad reactions from others.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal and ethical aspects. Driving under the influence is illegal and extremely dangerous. The person acted to prevent a possible drunk driving incident, which could have led to serious harm or death. From a safety perspective, their action was motivated by concern for others' lives. \n\nHowever, the ethical angle is tricky. Did they overstep by contacting the parent without the friend's consent? Parents have a right to know about their children's safety, especially when it comes to underage drinking and driving. The friend was 16 at the time of the event, which might make the situation more critical because it's not just about the driver but also about underage substance use.\n\nThe friends who posted about their own partying criticized the author, but their actions don't justify the friend's risky behavior. The author's decision to inform the parent was likely driven by fear of a potential accident, which is a valid concern. \n\nThe friend's reaction of punching the author is extreme, but that doesn't negate the initial action. The author's intention was to prevent a dangerous situation, and while the consequences were harsh, the intent was to protect lives. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the friend is the one who chose to drive under the influence despite being warned. The author tried to intervene by offering an Uber, which was refused. Then, as a last resort, contacting the parent was a reasonable step. \n\nSo, the answer seems to be that the author is not in the wrong. Their actions were based on safety concerns, even if the outcome was harsh. The key point is the intention to prevent harm, which is ethically justified.\n"
