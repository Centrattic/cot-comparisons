The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author did something wrong by calling their friend's mom when they saw her driving under the influence. \n\nFirst, the situation: The friend was at a party, drinking and smoking, then decided to drive. The author saw this through social media and called the mom to prevent a potential accident. The friend ended up getting grounded and had her car sold, leading to some backlash from classmates and a physical altercation.\n\nNow, the key points. The author's main concern is whether they were the asshole for intervening. The friend was of legal driving age (they're 17, but the friend is 16 in the event, but the legal drinking age in the US is usually 21, so she was underage. However, driving under influence is illegal regardless of age. The author's action was to prevent a dangerous situation. But then there's the fallout: the friend and others are upset, and the author feels guilty for both the intervention and the consequences.\n\nMADD (Mothers Against Drunk Driving) was having a presentation the same day, which adds context that the school was addressing this issue. The author's intent was to prevent harm, which is a good motive. But the method was to call the mom directly, which might be seen as overstepping by some, especially among peers. However, the alternative\u2014doing nothing\u2014could lead to a much worse outcome, like a car crash.\n\nThe friends and classmates are upset because they see the friend's actions as harmless fun, but the author is trying to prevent a serious issue. The friend punching the author suggests that she felt betrayed, which is understandable but not excusable. The author's guilt comes from the consequences but also from the potential regret if something had happened.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's action was to prevent a dangerous situation. Even though the method might have been direct, the intent was protective. However, some might argue that the author should have first tried to talk to the friend directly or involve another authority figure, but given that the friend was unresponsive and insisted on driving, calling the mom was a reasonable step to ensure safety. The fact that the parents took action and prevented a possible accident supports the author's decision. The backlash from peers and the friend's anger are unfortunate but don't make the author the asshole. The author's intention was to prevent harm, which is a valid reason. So, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
