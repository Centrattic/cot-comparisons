The party started first as a small gathering of friends drinking beer, eating pizza, watching movies. Someone posted on our grad Facebook page about this gathering and before I knew it there were like 50-60 people over smoking weed, drinking vodka and a bunch of other shit. I\u2019m not a smoker or drinker, so I left pretty quickly. My friend, who\u2019s also a grade 12 but was 16 at the time of this event, stayed. \n\nNow I\u2019m back home, reading, watching TV whatever. I\u2019m been on my phone, watching people Snapchat and Instagram\u2019s stories. In one, my friend is the focus where she\u2019s chugging a bottle of vodka, in another she\u2019s smoking a joint and in a third, she\u2019s doing shots with a guy. I know that she drove to the party so I text her to call an Uber. When she doesn\u2019t reply, I call her. She picks up and complains that Uber\u2019s too expensive so I offer to call one for her. She hangs up after saying she\u2019s fine to drive. \n\nMaybe 30 minutes later, I see on one of her friend\u2019s Snapchat story, like 5 different videos of her in the car, driving while smoking and drinking and texting on her phone and one video of them in a Macdonald\u2019s that was posted like 2 mins ago. \n\nI call my friend\u2019s mom and tell her what\u2019s happening. She says thanks and hangs up. I don\u2019t hear from her or her daughter for the rest of the night. \n\nShe\u2019s not at school the next day but I hear from from my friends and classmates that her mom and dad grounded her, taking away her phone for like 6 months and selling her car. All day, I had people, mostly her friends and other classmates who\u2019ve posted videos of themselves drinking and doing drugs, (hell one of the girls was a 16 who has a tinder account and who keeps a bottle of vodka in her locker) coming up to me and calling me a dick and an asshole and a bitch for calling her mom on her when she was just having some harmless fun. \n\nNow this was literally the same day when we had a MADD presentation at school. \n\nThe following day, she\u2019s back at school and the first thing she does when she sees me is punch me and call me a \u201cfucking life ruining asshole\u201d because on top of no phone and goodbye car, her parents aren\u2019t letting her attend any house parties and are considering not letting her go to after-prom. \n\nWas I the asshole for doing this? Because honestly, I kinda feel I am. I mean if something had happened and her car crashed and they died and I hadn\u2019t done anything, I\u2019d feel guilty for not doing anything. But now I feel guilty because I got her in trouble with her parents. And we used to be really good friends but in the last month, since she punched me, we haven\u2019t talked at all which kinda hurts. \n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who called their friend's mom was in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe person is 17, at a party that got big. They left early because they don't use alcohol or drugs. Their friend, who was 16 at the time, stayed. Later, the author sees the friend on social media chugging vodka, smoking, and doing shots. The author texts her to call an Uber, but she refuses and says she's fine to drive. Then, the author sees videos of her driving while smoking, drinking, and texting. So they call her mom. The mom thanks them and hangs up. The friend gets grounded, loses her phone and car. People call the author names, and the friend punches them later.\n\nThe author is torn between feeling guilty for getting her in trouble and thinking they did the right thing to prevent a possible accident. They used to be friends but aren't anymore now.\n\nHmm. The key points here are the legal implications. The friend was 16, so underage drinking and driving is illegal. The author saw her driving under the influence, which is a serious offense. The author tried to intervene first by offering an Uber but was refused. Then, after seeing the videos of her driving recklessly, they took action by informing the parents. The parents then took disciplinary actions.\n\nThe argument for the author being right is that they prevented a potential accident or worse. DUI is dangerous, especially with the combination of drugs and alcohol. The author was trying to protect their friend's safety and others on the road. The fact that there was a MADD presentation at school the same day adds context about the importance of not driving drunk.\n\nOn the other hand, some might say the author overstepped by contacting the parents without talking to the friend first. But given the immediate danger of DUI, the author's actions could be seen as necessary. The friend's actions were illegal and risky, so the author's intervention might be justified. The friend's anger and physical retaliation also indicate that the author's actions had consequences, but the alternative could have been a car crash.\n\nSo, considering the safety and legal aspects, the author probably wasn't in the wrong. They acted to prevent harm, even though it caused personal conflict. The friend's punishment from parents was a result of her own actions, not the author's. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
