She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girl. The situation is that the author's girlfriend, Diana, is making racist comments towards Black people. The author likes her a lot and is trying to make her stop being racist. His friend, who is Black, is upset and giving an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Dating someone who is racist is a complex issue. On one hand, the author is in a relationship and might not want to end it. On the other hand, supporting or not addressing racism can be problematic. The question is whether the author is at fault for not taking action against her racism.\n\nThe author mentions that racism in Eastern Europe might be more culturally accepted, but that doesn't excuse it. The girl's comments are specific: she doesn't like Black people and wouldn't go to Africa. The author is trying to change her behavior, but it's a difficult task. However, if the partner is unwilling to change, the author might be complicit by staying in the relationship.\n\nThe friend's reaction is strong, using \"bros before hoes,\" which is a controversial phrase. But the author's friend has a valid concern because racism is a serious issue. The author is choosing between a friend and a partner, which is tough. But does that mean the author is wrong for prioritizing the relationship?\n\nThe key points are: Is the author responsible for his partner's racism? Can he be held accountable for not addressing it effectively? If the partner isn't changing despite efforts, is he enabling the racism by staying?\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because he's making an effort to address the issue. However, there's a moral obligation to not support racism. But since the author is actively trying to change her behavior, he's not entirely at fault. The answer might be B, but there's nuance. Wait, the user's initial thought was that the author isn't in the wrong. But maybe I should consider that the author is in a position where he should take a stronger stance. If the partner isn't willing to change, then continuing the relationship could be seen as endorsing her views. So maybe the answer is A, but I'm conflicted. However, given the information, the author is trying, so B might be correct. Hmm.\n"
