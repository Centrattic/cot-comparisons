She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The author, let's call him Alex, has a girlfriend named Diana who he's really into. She's from Ukraine, and he mentions that in Eastern Europe, there might be cultural issues contributing to her racism. He's trying to change her views but faces pressure from a friend who is black and demands he choose between the friend or the girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether Alex is wrong for dating someone with racist views. Racism is a serious issue, and supporting or being in a relationship with someone who holds racist beliefs can be problematic. Alex is aware of her racism and is trying to address it, which is a positive step. However, just because he's trying doesn't necessarily mean he's in the right. If he's not actively challenging her views or encouraging her to change, he might be complicit in some way.\n\nThen there's the friend's ultimatum. The friend, who is black, feels betrayed because Alex is dating someone with racist views. The friend's reaction is understandable given his personal experience. Alex is caught between his relationship and his friendship. The key here is whether Alex's actions or inactions are contributing to the problem. If he's not taking a stand against racism, even if he's trying to change her, he might be seen as supporting it by association.\n\nCultural context is mentioned, but racism isn't just a cultural issue\u2014it's a moral one. Even if it's common in some regions, it doesn't excuse the behavior. Alex's responsibility is to his values. If he values equality as much as he claims, he should take a firm stance against racism, even if it means facing personal consequences like losing a girlfriend or a friend.\n\nHowever, the situation is complex. Alex is trying to help her change, which shows he's not entirely complicit. The question is whether that's enough. If he's not doing enough or if he's ignoring her racism, he's in the wrong. The fact that his friend is making an ultimatum shows the seriousness of the issue from the friend's perspective. Alex might be wrong not because he's dating her, but because he's not taking a stronger stand against her racism, especially when it directly affects his friend.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer depends on whether Alex's efforts to change her views are sufficient and if he's actively opposing her racism. If he's passive or not doing enough, he's in the wrong. If he's genuinely trying to address it, maybe not. But considering the friend's strong reaction and the moral weight of racism, the answer might lean towards him being in the wrong for not taking a firmer stance.\n"
