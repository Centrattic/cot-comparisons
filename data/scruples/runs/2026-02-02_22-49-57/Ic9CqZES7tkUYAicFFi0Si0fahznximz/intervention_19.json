She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girl. The situation is that the author is dating Diana, who is Ukrainian and has racist views against Black people. The author is happy with her and doesn't think he's betraying anything by being with her. But his friend, who is Black, is upset and giving an ultimatum: stop dating her or lose the friendship. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants to know.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is aware of Diana's racism, which he attributes to cultural background. He's trying to help her change, but it's not working. His friend is making a tough choice, using \"bros before hoes,\" which is a problematic phrase. The author is stuck between two important relationships.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, dating someone with racist views might seem wrong because it supports harmful attitudes. However, the author isn't the one being racist; he's trying to address it. But he's not actively opposing her racism, which could be seen as condoning it. Also, the friend's ultimatum is harsh, but the friend's feelings are valid given the racism.\n\nBut the author isn't the one being racist. He's making an effort, and the racism is part of the culture she comes from. However, staying with her might mean not taking a stand against her views. The author's responsibility might be to his friend, but if the friend is using an ultimatum, that's also a problem.\n\nHmm. So, is the author in the wrong? Well, he's dating someone who is racist. Even if he's trying to change her, by staying with her he's in a relationship with a racist. That could be seen as complicity. But then again, he's not the one being racist. The user's analysis is that the author isn't wrong, but maybe that's because they're prioritizing the relationship. But in terms of ethics, supporting someone who holds racist views, even if you're trying to change them, might still be problematic. The friend's reaction is strong, but valid because racism is a serious issue. However, the author isn't the one committing the racism. So the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong, because he's not the racist one. But others might argue that by staying with her, he's enabling her racism. But since he's trying to address it, maybe he's not at fault. I think the answer is B, No.\n"
