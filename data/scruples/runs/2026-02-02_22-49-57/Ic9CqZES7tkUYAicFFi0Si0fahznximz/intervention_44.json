She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that his girlfriend, Diana, is racist against Black people. He's in a relationship with her and really likes her. He's trying to get her to change her views, which he acknowledges is a difficult process. He also has a close Black friend who is upset and giving him an ultimatum to choose between the girlfriend and the friend. The friend says \"bros before hoes,\" which is a classic example of a toxic friendship.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author isn't in the wrong. I need to evaluate if that's accurate. \n\nThe key points here are: the author is trying to address his girlfriend's racism, which is a significant issue. He's not ignoring it but is actively working on it. However, the girlfriend's racism is causing problems with his friend, who is making a harmful choice. The author is caught between two people he cares about. \n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, supporting a racist partner isn't okay, but the author isn't endorsing the racism himself. He's trying to change her views. However, by staying with her despite her racism, he might be enabling it or not taking a strong enough stance against it. \n\nBut wait, the user argues that changing someone's racist views is a long process. The author is making an effort, which is commendable. However, the friend's ultimatum is problematic. The phrase \"bros before hoes\" is inherently flawed because it devalues the importance of the relationship and can perpetuate harmful stereotypes. The friend is making a choice that's not fair, as the author isn't the one being racist. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? If the author is aware of his girlfriend's racism and is actively trying to address it, he's not entirely at fault. However, there's a responsibility in relationships to not tolerate harmful ideologies. If the racism is something that can't be changed, continuing the relationship could be seen as complicity. \n\nBut the author is in the early stages of the relationship and is making an effort. The friend's reaction is extreme and not his fault, really. The author isn't the one being racist. The question is whether he's in the wrong for dating someone with those views. \n\nOn one hand, he's not the one being racist. On the other, staying in a relationship with someone who holds racist views could be seen as supporting those views indirectly. However, the complexity here is that he's trying to change her. \n\nI think the answer is B (No) because the author is making a conscious effort to address the issue and isn't the one being racist. The friend's ultimatum is the real problem here. The author isn't in the wrong for trying to navigate this difficult situation, even if the outcome is challenging.\n"
