She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The scenario involves the girlfriend being racist against black people, which the author is trying to address. The author's friend, who is black, is upset and giving an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, racism is a serious issue. The girlfriend's comments about disliking black people and not wanting to go to Africa are clear examples of racist views. The author is aware of this and is trying to change her behavior, but it's challenging, especially if it's culturally ingrained.\n\nThe friend's reaction is strong, using \"bros before hoes,\" which is a problematic phrase as it devalues the relationship. However, the friend's stance is about not tolerating racism, which is a valid position. The author is caught between the two, not wanting to lose either.\n\nThe key points here are accountability and the impact of the girlfriend's racism. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for dating her because they might not be the one being racist. However, the author's responsibility to address and challenge racism in their partner is important. If the author is complicit by not taking a stronger stance or if they're excusing her racism, that could be problematic. But since the author is actively trying to change her behavior, it's a complex situation.\n\nThe friend's ultimatum is extreme, but his concern is valid. The author needs to consider whether staying with the girlfriend perpetuates harm, even if they're trying to change her. The answer hinges on whether the author is enabling the racism or actively working against it. Since the author is making efforts but the racism remains, there's a nuance here. However, the question is if the author is in the wrong. Since the author is aware of the issue and is trying to address it, they might not be in the wrong, but the situation is complicated.\n"
