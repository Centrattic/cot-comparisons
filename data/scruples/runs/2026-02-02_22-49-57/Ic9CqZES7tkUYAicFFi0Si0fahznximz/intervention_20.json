She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The author is in a relationship with a Ukrainian girl named Diana, whom he really likes. However, she's described as being \"kind of racist\" against Black people. The user's friend, who is Black, is upset and giving an ultimatum: choose between the girlfriend or the friendship. The author is conflicted but doesn't feel he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that in Eastern Europe, there might be cultural attitudes towards race, and he's tried to get his girlfriend to not express racism. The specific incident mentioned is that she says she doesn't like Black people much and wouldn't want to go to Africa. The friend is Kenyan, so this is a direct insult.\n\nNow, is the author at fault? Well, the girlfriend's racist views are a problem. The author is trying to address it by asking her not to express those views. But the friend is taking it as a betrayal, which is a different issue. The author is caught between two people he cares about. The key here is whether the author is responsible for his girlfriend's racism. \n\nIn relationships, people do have to consider each other's values. If someone is openly racist, that's a red flag. However, the author is making an effort to address it. But is it the author's responsibility to 'cure' someone of racism? That's a complex issue. The author isn't the one being racist; he's the one trying to change her behavior. However, he's also in a position where his friend is being targeted by his girlfriend's views. \n\nThe friend's ultimatum is problematic. Friends shouldn't be telling someone to break up, but the friend's feelings are valid given the racism. The author is trying to navigate this, but the girlfriend's views are harmful. Even if it's a cultural issue, racism is wrong regardless. The author is not directly responsible for her views, but he may be complicit by continuing the relationship despite knowing her racist tendencies. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author is in the wrong for choosing to be with someone who holds racist views. On one hand, he's trying to change her. On the other, he might be enabling her by not ending the relationship if she's unwilling to change. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's making an effort and the girlfriend's racism is her own issue, maybe the author isn't in the wrong. But there's a line where continuing a relationship with a racist could be considered complicity. However, the author isn't the one being racist. The friend's reaction is also extreme. \n\nI think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong), but there's nuance. The author isn't responsible for her racism, but he's in a tough spot. The friend's ultimatum is not his fault. The key is whether the author is supporting racism by staying with her. If the girlfriend isn't willing to change, then the author might be complicit, but the post suggests he's trying. So, the answer is B.\n"
