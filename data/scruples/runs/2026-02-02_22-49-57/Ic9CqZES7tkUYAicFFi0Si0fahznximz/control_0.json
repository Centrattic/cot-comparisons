She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girl. The situation is that the author is in a new relationship with a Ukrainian girl who has racist views against black people. Some of his friends, including his best friend who is black, are upset and giving him an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The girl's racism is a problem. The author is trying to help her change, but his friend is making a choice between the relationship and the friendship. The user wants to know if the author is at fault.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong for continuing the relationship. On one hand, racism is a serious issue, and supporting someone's racist views can be harmful. The friend's reaction is understandable because the author is in a relationship with someone who holds these views, which might affect their shared experience and the friend's comfort.\n\nBut the author mentions that the racism might be cultural and that changing someone's views is difficult. He's trying to address it. However, staying in a relationship with someone who is racist, even if they're trying to change, can be problematic. The line between supporting personal growth and enabling harmful behavior is thin. If the girl isn't making efforts to change or if her racism is deeply ingrained, the author might be in a tough spot.\n\nThe friend's ultimatum is extreme, but his hurt feelings are valid. The author's responsibility here might be to his friend's feelings as well as his own values. If the author values his friendship and the friend's well-being, he might need to consider how his relationship affects them. But he also has the right to his own happiness and relationships, provided they don't directly harm others.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he's aware of her racism and isn't doing enough to address it, maybe. But he is trying. The problem is more about the friend's reaction being an ultimatum rather than the author's actions. The question is whether the author is wrong for being in the relationship. Since the girl is racist, and the author isn't doing enough to mitigate that (like encouraging her to change or setting boundaries), he might be in the wrong by not taking a stronger stance. Alternatively, if he's genuine in trying to help her, maybe he's not entirely at fault. \n\nBut the core issue is that being in a relationship with a racist person can be harmful, especially if it affects others. The author's friend is directly impacted, and the author's choice to prioritize the relationship over the friendship might be seen as wrong. So the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he's choosing to stay in a relationship that has racist elements, which harms his friend's feelings and possibly contributes to a toxic environment. However, some might argue that the friend's reaction is too harsh, and the author isn't entirely to blame. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong for dating a racist person. Since racism is wrong, supporting or staying with someone who is racist could be considered complicit, hence the author is in the wrong.\n"
