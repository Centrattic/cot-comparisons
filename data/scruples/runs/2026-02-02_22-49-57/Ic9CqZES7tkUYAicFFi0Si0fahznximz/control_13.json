She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong for dating a girl who's racist against black people. The main question is if they're making a mistake by continuing the relationship despite her racist views, especially when a close friend is upset and giving an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The guy is dating Diana from Ukraine, who has racist attitudes towards black people. He's in Europe, and he's trying to help her not be racist, but she hasn't changed. His friend, who is black, is upset that the guy is dating someone racist and is giving him an ultimatum between the friend and the girlfriend.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the girlfriend's racism, the guy's attempts to address it, the friend's reaction, and the ultimatum. The guy is caught between two people he cares about.\n\nNow, considering ethical perspectives. Racism is a serious issue. Being in a relationship with someone who holds racist views can be problematic, especially if those views cause harm or are directed towards specific groups. The guy is trying to change her, but that's not something others can be forced to do. However, if someone is racist, it might affect the relationship's values alignment.\n\nBut is the guy in the wrong? Well, he's not the one being racist here. He's trying to address the issue. However, the question is whether he's wrong for continuing the relationship. If the girlfriend isn't changing, maybe he should reconsider. But the user is asking if he's in the wrong for not breaking up yet.\n\nThe friend's ultimatum is a separate issue. Friends shouldn't make ultimataums over differences in relationships unless it's a major issue. The friend's approach could be seen as toxic if they're not respecting the guy's choice, unless the racism is causing harm to the friend directly.\n\nThe guy's responsibility here is to address the racism in the relationship. If the girlfriend isn't willing to change, then the guy might need to evaluate if he can be in a relationship with someone who holds those views. But the user is asking if he's in the wrong for not breaking up yet. At this stage, if he's making efforts to address it, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, if he's aware of her racism and isn't taking it seriously enough, that could be the case.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend's racist remarks, like not liking black people or not wanting to go to Africa, are explicit and harmful. The guy's friend is part of the affected group. The guy might not be in the wrong for being with her, but he's in a dilemma. However, since the friend is part of the marginalized group, the ultimatum is more about standing by someone who's being discriminated against.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the girlfriend is the one in the wrong for being racist. The guy is caught in the middle. So, is he in the wrong? If he continues the relationship despite her racism, maybe he's complicit in some way. But it's also possible that he's not in the wrong because he's trying to help her change.\n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). Considering that racism is harmful and the guy is dating someone who hasn't changed despite his efforts, maybe he's not in the wrong for trying to work on it. But if he's not taking action to end the relationship when she's not changing, maybe he is. However, the user is in the middle of this situation and hasn't made a decision yet. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's making efforts to address the issue, but it's not a clear-cut case. Alternatively, if he's not taking the racism seriously enough, maybe A. But since he's trying, B might be the answer.\n"
