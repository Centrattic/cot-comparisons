She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking about a situation where he's dating a Ukrainian girl who's a bit racist, especially towards Black people. He mentions it's a cultural issue in Eastern Europe and that he's tried to address it. His best friend, who is Black, is upset and giving him an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is in a relationship with someone who makes racist comments. He's aware of the issue and has tried to make her stop. The friend is a significant person in his life, so breaking up the friendship over this is a big deal. The author is caught between two relationships: his girlfriend's racism versus his friendship with a close friend. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for dating someone with racist views? Well, he's not the one being racist, so he's not directly responsible for her views. However, by choosing to date her despite knowing her racism, he might be enabling it or not taking the issue seriously enough. But he's already trying to address it, which shows he's aware and trying to change her behavior. \n\nOn the other hand, his friend's reaction is strong. Using \"bros before hoes\" might come off as dismissive of the girlfriend's humanity, but the friend's stance is that supporting racism is wrong. The author's friend is standing up against racism, which is a valid position. The author is trying to balance both, but the friend is giving an ultimatum, which is extreme. \n\nThe author's actions: he's not perpetuating racism himself but is part of a relationship where racism exists. Depending on cultural context, maybe he's not fully aware of the severity. He's trying to address it, which is a good step. But the girlfriend's racist comments towards Black people and her unwillingness to change could make him complicit if he ignores it. However, the friend's ultimatum is a harsh response, possibly invalidating the author's efforts.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If he's aware of her racism and isn't doing enough to confront it, maybe. But he's making efforts. The friend's response is extreme. The author isn't the one being racist, so he's not directly in the wrong. However, he might be in the wrong if he's prioritizing the relationship over anti-racism values. But since he's trying to change her behavior, it's tricky. The question is whether dating a racist person makes him complicit. It depends on his actions. If he's actively working to address it, maybe not. But if he's ignoring it, then yes. In this case, he's trying, so maybe he's not in the wrong. \n\nAlso, the friend's approach is problematic because it's an ultimatum that forces a choice between two important relationships without room for dialogue. The author might be in a tough spot where he's trying to navigate both issues without clear solutions. The answer hinges on whether the author is complicit in the racism. Since he's not the one being racist and is trying to change her, he might not be in the wrong. But if the girlfriend is unwilling to change, he might be enabling her racism by staying with her. However, the user is asking if he's in the wrong, and the options are A or B. Given the context, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's trying to address the issue, even if the situation is complicated.\n"
