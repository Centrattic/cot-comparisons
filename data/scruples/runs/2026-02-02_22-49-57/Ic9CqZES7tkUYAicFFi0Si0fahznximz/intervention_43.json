She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girl. The situation involves the author's girlfriend making racist remarks against Black people, specifically against a Kenyan friend. The friend is giving an ultimatum: choose between the girlfriend or the friendship. The author is torn and wants to know if they're in the wrong for staying with their girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend is from Eastern Europe, which the author mentions might have cultural influences contributing to her racism. The author is trying to help her change her views, which is a good effort. However, racism is a serious issue, and the fact that the girlfriend has made specific racist comments (disliking Black people and not wanting to go to Africa) is problematic.\n\nThe friend's reaction is strong, using \"bros before hoes,\" which is a bit of a problematic phrase because it reduces relationships to a hierarchy. But the friend is directly affected since he's Black and his close friend is dating someone who dislikes his community. The author is caught in the middle, not wanting to lose either the girlfriend or the friend.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. If the author is aware of the racism and continues the relationship despite the friend's valid concerns, that could be seen as enabling the girlfriend's behavior. But the author is also trying to address the issue, which shows they're not complicit. However, staying in a relationship with someone who has racist views, especially when it directly affects friends, can be hurtful. The author might not be in the wrong morally, but they are in a difficult position where their choice impacts others negatively.\n\nBut the question is about whether they are in the wrong. If we take the stance that supporting racism is wrong, then the author might be enabling it by staying. However, if they're actively trying to change her views, maybe not. It's a gray area. The friend's ultimatum is harsh, but his feelings are valid. The author's choice to stay with the girlfriend might not be their fault, but they should also consider the impact on their friend.\n"
