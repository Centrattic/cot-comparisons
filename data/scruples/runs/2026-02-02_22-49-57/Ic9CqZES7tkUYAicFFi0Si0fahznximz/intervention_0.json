She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The scenario is that the guy really likes his Ukrainian girlfriend, Diana, but she's racist towards Black people. Some of his friends, including a close Black friend, are upset and giving him an ultimatum: choose between the girlfriend or the friend. He's trying to get her to stop being racist but hasn't succeeded yet.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the girlfriend's racism and the friend's reaction. The author is in a new relationship (only a week) and is trying to change her behavior. But racism is a deep-seated issue. The friend's ultimatum is extreme, which complicates things. \n\nOn one hand, the author might not be wrong because he's making an effort to address the racism and isn't condoning it. He's trying to improve the situation. On the other hand, being in a relationship with someone who is racist could be seen as problematic, especially if he's aware of her views and they conflict with his values. However, the text mentions that this is a cultural issue in Eastern Europe, which might explain her views, but that doesn't excuse them. The author is caught between two important relationships and is trying to navigate both.\n\nThe friend's ultimatum is harsh, which might indicate that the friend isn't considering the complexity of the situation. The author's responsibility is to address the racism in his partner, but he's taking steps to do that. Since the relationship is new, it's unclear if the racism is a core part of her identity or a phase she's working on. The author's actions seem to be in line with addressing the issue rather than ignoring it.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong because he's making an effort to address the racism and isn't condoning it. The friend's reaction is extreme, but the author's actions don't clearly support the racism. Therefore, the answer would be B.\n"
