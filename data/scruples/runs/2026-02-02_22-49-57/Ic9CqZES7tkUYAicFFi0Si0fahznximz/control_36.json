She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he's dating a Ukrainian girl who's racist against black people. He likes her a lot, but some of his friends, including a black one, are upset. The friend is giving him an ultimatum: choose between the girlfriend and the friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider racism. Racism is a serious issue, and anyone who holds racist views is problematic. The girlfriend's comments about not liking black people and not wanting to go to Africa are examples of that. The author is trying to change her, but he's also facing pressure from his friend. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong by choosing to stay with his girlfriend despite her racism. On one hand, supporting a partner who has racist views might be seen as endorsing those views, even if you're trying to help them change. On the other hand, relationships involve accepting certain aspects of a person, but racism is a harmful trait that can affect others around them.\n\nThe friend's reaction is extreme, using \"bros before hoes,\" which is a problematic phrase itself because it devalues relationships and people's feelings. However, the main issue is the girlfriend's racism. The author might be in the wrong if he's enabling racism by staying with her, especially if he knows it's causing harm to his friend. But if he's genuinely trying to help her change, maybe he's not entirely in the wrong. However, it's important to note that changing someone's racist views is not the responsibility of their partner. The real problem here is the girlfriend's racism, not the author necessarily, unless he's actively supporting it. The author is conflicted and trying to mediate, but the core issue is the girlfriend's prejudice. So, the answer might be that the author isn't in the wrong, but the girlfriend is. However, by staying with her, he's associating with someone who has harmful views, which could make him complicit to some extent. But the question is whether he's in the wrong, not the girlfriend. Since he's trying to address it, maybe he's not. But if he's aware of her racism and doesn't take a stand, maybe he is. It's a tricky one. I think the answer would be A, he's in the wrong because he's choosing to be in a relationship with someone who's racist, even if he's trying to change her. But the friend's ultimatum is also harsh. However, the main question is the author's actions. So, maybe the answer is A.\n"
