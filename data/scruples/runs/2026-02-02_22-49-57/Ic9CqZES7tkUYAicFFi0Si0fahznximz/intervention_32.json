She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girl. The situation is that the author is in a new relationship with a Ukrainian girl named Diana, who has racist views, particularly against Black people. The author is trying to get her to stop being racist but faces an ultimatum from a friend who is Black. The friend says either break up with Diana or lose him as a friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author likes Diana and they're happy together, but racism is a problem. The friend's reaction is strong, using \"bros before hoes,\" which is a problematic phrase because it prioritizes friendships over relationships, which can be disrespectful. Also, the friend is Kenyan, so the author's girlfriend's comment about not liking Black people and avoiding Africa could be hurtful.\n\nNow, the author is in a dilemma. On one hand, dating someone racist is problematic because racism is harmful and perpetuates discrimination. The author might be enabling or normalizing her behavior by staying with her. On the other hand, the author is trying to address it and hasn't given up on the relationship, which shows effort.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author continues the relationship knowing Diana is racist and her actions are hurtful to others, especially to the Black friend, that could be seen as condoning her behavior. Even if the racism is cultural, the author has a responsibility to support their friend and not be complicit in racism. The fact that the friend is making an ultimatum is extreme, but the author's choice to stay with Diana despite her racism could still be problematic. However, the author is trying to address the issue, which is a positive step. \n\nBut is that enough? If the author can't influence Diana to change her views, then the relationship might be harmful. The answer might depend on whether the author is actively working to counter her racism or just ignoring it. The user's own thought is that the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to weigh both sides. The key is that racism is a serious issue, and being in a relationship with someone who holds such views can be harmful. So even if the author is trying, being in the relationship might still make them complicit. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not taking a stronger stand against the racism. Alternatively, if they're genuinely trying to help her change, maybe not. But the ultimatum from the friend is also an issue. However, the main question is the author's responsibility regarding the girlfriend's racism. I think the answer leans towards the author being in the wrong because they're not actively opposing racism but choosing to stay in the relationship despite it, which can be seen as supporting it indirectly. So the answer would be A.\n"
