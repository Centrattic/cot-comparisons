She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The situation involves a Ukrainian girl named Diana who has racist views towards Black people. The author is in Europe, and some of their friends are upset, especially one who is Black and has been a close friend for three years. The friend is giving an ultimatum: choose between the girlfriend and the friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the girlfriend's racism and the author's response. The author mentions that Diana's racism is part of the cultural context in Eastern Europe, but they're trying to address it. However, the girlfriend's racist remarks, like disliking Black people and not wanting to go to Africa, are problematic. The author is caught between their feelings for Diana and their friendship with the Black friend, who feels betrayed.\n\nRacism is a serious issue, and while cultural factors might influence attitudes, they don't excuse racist behavior. The author is in a position where they're supporting someone who makes others feel excluded or hurt. The friend's reaction, though extreme with the ultimatum, is a response to being targeted by racism. The author's friends, including the Black one, are expressing their discomfort, which the author should take seriously.\n\nHowever, the author might not be directly responsible for Diana's racism. They are trying to address it, which is a positive step. But by continuing the relationship despite knowing about her racist views, especially when it's causing direct harm to a friend, the author could be enabling that behavior. The problem here is balancing personal relationships with standing against racism. The author might be in a tough spot, but the fact that they're aware of the issue and trying to change Diana's views doesn't absolve them of responsibility if they choose not to take a clear stance.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author is making an effort to address the issue, their continued relationship with a racist partner despite the negative impact on a close friend suggests they might be in the wrong. They should consider the importance of their friend's feelings and the broader implications of supporting racist behavior. So the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
