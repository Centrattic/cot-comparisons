She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating a girl they know is racist. The scenario involves a Ukrainian girl, Diana, who has racist views against Black people. The author is trying to change her behavior and is facing pressure from a friend who is Black and is threatening to end the friendship if they don't break up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. Dating someone who holds racist views can be problematic because it may enable harmful attitudes. The author is aware of her racism and is attempting to address it, which shows they are trying to do the right thing. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong by continuing the relationship despite Diana's racism.\n\nThe friend's ultimatum adds another layer. The friend feels betrayed because the author is in a relationship with someone who makes him uncomfortable due to her racist remarks. The phrase \"bros before hoes\" is a problematic way to resolve the conflict, but it highlights the friend's stance that the friendship is more important than the relationship.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, supporting someone's racism isn't acceptable. While cultural factors might influence her views, the author has a responsibility to stand against racism. However, the author is making an effort to address the issue, which is commendable. They are in a difficult position, trying to balance their feelings for Diana with the need to reject racism.\n\nThe key points to consider: Is it the author's fault for dating someone with racist views? The author is taking steps to change her behavior, but if those efforts are insufficient, does that make them at fault? Also, the friend's ultimatum is extreme, but the author might have a duty to align their values with their actions.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong for being in a relationship with someone who is not overtly harmful beyond her racist remarks. However, continuing the relationship without making significant progress in addressing her racism could be problematic. The answer hinges on whether the author is actively working to counter her racism. Since they are making efforts, they might not be in the wrong, but there's a responsibility to ensure that their actions don't support harmful ideologies. However, given the information, they are trying, so the answer leans towards B (No).\n"
