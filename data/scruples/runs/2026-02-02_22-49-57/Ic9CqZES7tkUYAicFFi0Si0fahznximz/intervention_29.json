She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating a girl who's racist. The situation is that the author is dating Diana, who's from Ukraine and has racist views against Black people. The author is trying to address this but a friend is giving an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is trying to help Diana change her views, which is a good step. The friend is pushing for an ultimatum, which can be toxic. The author is in a dilemma between two important relationships. \n\nThe friend's statement \"bros before hoes\" is a classic toxic masculinity line that prioritizes male friendship over respecting the partner. That's problematic because it enforces harmful gender norms. The author might be in the right by choosing not to let a friend dictate the relationship. \n\nBut wait, the author should also consider if they're enabling racism by staying with her. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author is actively trying to address the issue, maybe they're not in the wrong. The friend's approach is more harmful. \n\nAlso, the author mentions that racism in Eastern Europe might be more culturally ingrained. It's a complex issue, and changing someone's views is hard. The author isn't ignoring the problem but is working on it. The friend is oversimplifying the situation with an ultimatum, which isn't healthy. \n\nSo, the answer leans towards B (the author is not in the wrong) because they're making an effort to address the racism and the friend is using a toxic approach. The author isn't condoning racism but is dealing with the complexities of a relationship and cultural context.\n"
