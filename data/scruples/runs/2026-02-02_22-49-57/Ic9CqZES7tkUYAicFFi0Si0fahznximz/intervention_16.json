She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The girlfriend, Diana, is Ukrainian and has some racist views against Black people. The author is trying to address this by encouraging Diana to avoid racist comments, especially in front of friends and family. However, one of the author's friends, who is Black, is upset and giving an ultimatum: the author must choose between the girlfriend and the friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is in a new relationship and is dealing with a sensitive issue. It's important to note that the author doesn't seem to condone racism and is actively trying to change Diana's behavior. The girlfriend's racism might be influenced by cultural factors in Eastern Europe, as the author mentions hearing similar stories from his dad. However, just because it's a cultural issue doesn't mean it's acceptable. The author is right to want to address it, especially since his friend is directly affected.\n\nNow, looking at the friend's reaction. \"Bros before hoes\" is a controversial phrase, often seen as diminishing the relationship. But the friend's concern is valid because experiencing racism from someone close to their friend can be hurtful. The author is being asked to choose, which can strain both relationships. However, the author is not the one being racist; he's the one trying to mediate. \n\nThe key point is whether the author is in the wrong for continuing the relationship. If the author is committed to working on the issue and helping Diana unlearn her biases, then he isn't in the wrong. But if he's ignoring the problem or enabling her racism, that would be different. The user's question suggests that the author is making an effort, so they might not be at fault. \n\nHowever, it's also important to consider that while the author isn't directly racist, being in a relationship with someone who holds racist views can still be problematic. The author needs to assess if Diana is willing to change and how much effort is required. If the author is supportive but the girlfriend isn't making progress, that's another layer. But given the information, the author is trying and isn't the one with the racist views. The friend's ultimatum is harsh, but the situation isn't the author's fault. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong for dating her, but he's in a tough spot and needs to handle both relationships carefully.\n"
