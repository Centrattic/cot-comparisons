She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The main points are:\n\n1. The girlfriend is racist against Black people, which the author attributes to cultural factors from Eastern Europe.\n2. The author's friend, who is Black, is upset and giving an ultimatum: choose between the girlfriend and the friend.\n3. The author is trying to address the racism but is caught between two important relationships.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Dating someone with racist views can be problematic because it may perpetuate harmful attitudes. However, the author is making an effort to address this, which is a positive step. But the key here is whether the author is complicit or enabling the racism by staying with the girlfriend despite her views.\n\nThe friend's reaction is intense, using a problematic phrase (\"bros before hoes\"), which is itself a red flag. The phrase devalues the girlfriend and suggests a hierarchy of relationships where male friendships are prioritized over romantic relationships, which is not healthy. The friend's ultimatum is extreme and may not be a valid reason to stay with a racist partner.\n\nThe author's responsibility isn't just about the friend's feelings but about supporting and challenging the girlfriend to change her views. If the author continues the relationship without the girlfriend addressing her racism, they might be enabling it. On the other hand, the author is still in the early stages of the relationship, which complicates things.\n\nCultural factors are mentioned, but that shouldn't excuse racism. Everyone is responsible for their own behavior regardless of cultural background. The author's approach to changing the girlfriend's views is important here. If the author is actively working on this, that's good, but if they're justifying the racism as cultural, that's problematic.\n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, the author is not necessarily wrong for being with someone with racist views if they are actively trying to address it. However, if the author isn't doing enough to challenge the racism or if they are ignoring it, that could make them complicit. The question is whether the author's actions (trying to change her) are sufficient, or if they should have ended the relationship earlier.\n\nThe friend's ultimatum is a separate issue. The phrase \"bros before hoes\" is toxic and dismissive of the girlfriend's worth. The author shouldn't feel pressured by that, as it's not a healthy dynamic. The friend's approach is more about asserting dominance in the friendship rather than addressing the racism constructively.\n\nIn summary, the author's fault depends on their actions. If they are genuinely working to address the racism, they might not be in the wrong. However, staying in a relationship with someone who is racist without making progress could be problematic. The answer hinges on whether the author is actively involved in challenging the racism or justifying it.\n"
