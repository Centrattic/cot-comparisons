She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girl. The situation is that the guy is dating a Ukrainian girl who is racist against Black people. He's happy with her but his best friend, who is Black, is upset and giving him an ultimatum. The question is whether the author is wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girl is racist, which is a serious issue. Racism is generally considered a bad trait, and supporting or being in a relationship with someone who holds racist views can be problematic. The author is trying to get her to stop being racist, but it's not working. His friend is upset because he feels the author is betraying him by dating someone racist. The friend is even making an ultimatum, which adds pressure on the author.\n\nNow, the author's defense is that racism is a cultural thing in Eastern Europe and that changing someone's views is hard. But is that a valid excuse? Cultural context doesn't make racism right. While it's true that some people may grow up with these attitudes, it's the responsibility of the individual to challenge and change those views, not just accept them. The author is in a position where he's choosing to stay with someone who has these views despite the negative impact on his friend and possibly others.\n\nAnother angle: the author is aware of her racism and has been trying to address it. However, if she continues to make racist remarks, even after his efforts, then he might be complicit by staying with her. The fact that his friend is Kenyan and the girl's racism directly affects him shows that it's not just a general dislike but targeted towards a specific group. The ultimatum from the friend adds another layer, but the main issue is the author's decision to be in a relationship with someone who is racist.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If he values his friend's feelings and the friend's well-being, staying with the racist girlfriend could be seen as prioritizing a new relationship over a long-time friend. However, relationships are personal, and the friend's ultimatum is harsh. But the core issue is the girlfriend's racism. Even if the author isn't personally racist, supporting someone who is can be harmful. The author should consider whether he's enabling her racism by staying with her instead of addressing it more directly.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author might not be a \"bad person,\" he is in a morally ambiguous position. However, the fact that he's aware of her racism and it's affecting others (his friend) suggests that he might be in the wrong by not taking a stronger stance against her views. So the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
