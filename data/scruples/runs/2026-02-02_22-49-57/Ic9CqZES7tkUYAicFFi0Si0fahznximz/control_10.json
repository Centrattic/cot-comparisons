She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girl. The situation is that the author is in a new relationship with a Ukrainian woman who has racist views against Black people. The author is trying to help her change her views but is facing backlash from a friend who is Black and is giving an ultimatum to choose between the relationship or the friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend's racism is a significant issue because it directly affects others, especially the author's Black friend. The author is aware of the problem and is trying to address it, but the girlfriend hasn't changed her behavior. The friend feels betrayed and is demanding the author to end the relationship, using \"bros before hoes\" as a justification. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the author is in a relationship and is making an effort to address the racist behavior. On the other hand, supporting racism, even if it's the partner's, is problematic. The author's friend's ultimatum is harsh, but the core issue is the girlfriend's racism. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong for being in a relationship with someone who has racist views, especially if they're trying to change those views. However, the author might be in the wrong if they are not holding their partner accountable enough. But since the author is actively trying to help the girlfriend change, it's a bit of a gray area. The friend's reaction, while hurtful, is a result of the girlfriend's behavior. The author's responsibility is to both the relationship and their friendship, but it's their choice how to navigate that. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), because the author isn't inherently wrong for dating someone with racist views if they're working to address it. But the girlfriend's racism is the real issue here, not the author's choice. The author is trying to balance both, but the friend's ultimatum is extreme. The author isn't wrong for choosing to work on the relationship, especially since they're making an effort to change the behavior.\n"
