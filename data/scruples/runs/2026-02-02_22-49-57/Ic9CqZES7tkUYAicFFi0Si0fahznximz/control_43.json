She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The situation involves a Ukrainian girl who's racist against black people, and the author's friend is upset, giving an ultimatum. The author is trying to balance his relationship with his girlfriend and his friend.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The girlfriend is racist, which the author acknowledges. The author is trying to change her views, but the friend is upset and creating a conflict. The friend is using the \"bros before hoes\" line, which is a problematic phrase in itself, implying that friendships should take precedence over relationships, which is a simplistic and often harmful way to handle conflicts.\n\nThe author's actions: he's aware of her racism, is trying to address it, but the friend is pressuring him to choose. The question is whether the author is in the wrong by continuing the relationship. \n\nRacism is a serious issue. Dating someone who is racist can be problematic, especially if the racism affects others. The author's friend, who is black, feels betrayed, which is valid because racism directly impacts him. The author might be in a tough spot because he's trying to manage his girlfriend's behavior, but the friend's reaction is also valid given the personal impact of racism.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong? He's not the racist one; he's the one trying to address it. However, by continuing the relationship when she's openly racist, he might be enabling that behavior or not taking a firm stance against it. The line between supporting someone to change and justifying harmful behavior is thin. If the author is aware and doesn't take a clear stand, that could be seen as complicity.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is in the early stages of the relationship (a week) and is making efforts to address the issue. The friend's ultimatum is extreme and potentially toxic, using peer pressure to end the relationship. The friend's approach might be more harmful than the author dating someone with racist views.\n\nSo, is the author wrong? It depends on the perspective. If the author is aware of the racism and continues the relationship without addressing it, that's problematic. But he's actively trying to change her behavior. The friend's ultimatum is also an issue because it's an extreme response. The answer might hinge on whether the author is actively supporting the racism by staying with her despite her views. However, since the author is trying to correct her behavior, maybe he's not entirely in the wrong. But given that racism is harmful, continuing the relationship could be seen as complicity. \n\nThe correct answer is A, the author is in the wrong. Because even if he's trying to change her, he's in a relationship with someone who holds racist views, which can perpetuate harm. The friend's reaction is valid, and the author should consider the impact of his choices on others affected by racism.\n"
