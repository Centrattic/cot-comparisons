She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The person is in a situation where his girlfriend has racist views, particularly against black people. He mentions that she doesn't like black people much and wouldn't want to go to Africa. His friend, who is black, is upset and is making an ultimatum for him to choose between the girlfriend or the friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The girlfriend's racism is an issue. Even if it's cultural, racism is a serious problem. The author is trying to change her views, but it's hard. The friend is giving an ultimatum, which is stressful for the author.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nIf the author is in the wrong, it would be because he's supporting or enabling someone with racist views despite knowing the harm it causes. On the other hand, if he's not in the wrong, it could be because he's trying to address her racism and he's not responsible for her views, especially if they are cultural. However, staying in a relationship with someone who expresses racism might be seen as complicit in their behavior, especially when others are hurt by it.\n\nBut wait, the friend is making an ultimatum, which is not ideal. The author's friends and family are being affected by the girlfriend's comments. The author is trying to mediate, but maybe he's not doing enough. However, changing someone's deep-seated beliefs is difficult, and the author is making an effort. \n\nThe problem is that the girlfriend's racism is causing direct harm to his friend. Even if the racism is cultural, it's still harmful. The author might be in the wrong if he's not taking stronger action to address the racism. But if he's making a genuine effort, maybe he's not. \n\nI think the key here is that the author is aware of the racism and is trying to change the situation, but it's not enough. The girlfriend's actions are causing real harm to others, and the author's decision to continue the relationship despite this might be seen as supporting her racism. Therefore, the author could be in the wrong for not taking a stand against her racist views, even if he's trying to work on it. \n\nBut there's also the aspect of cultural context. The author mentions that this might be common in Eastern Europe. However, that doesn't excuse racism. So even if it's a cultural thing, it's still wrong. The author's responsibility is to not support or enable racism, even if it's part of the culture. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author is making an effort, the fact that he's in a relationship with someone who expresses racist views and is causing harm to others might make him complicit. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong). But I need to make sure I'm not overcomplicating it. If the friend is making an ultimatum, maybe the problem is with the friend's approach, but the author's choice to stay with the girlfriend despite her racism is the issue.\n"
