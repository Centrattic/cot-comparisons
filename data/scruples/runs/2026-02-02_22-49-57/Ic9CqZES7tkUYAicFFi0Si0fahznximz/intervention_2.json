She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The author is from Europe, dating a Ukrainian girl named Diana. He mentions that she's racist against Black people, which he attributes to cultural factors in Eastern Europe. He's trying to get her to stop being racist, especially around his friends and family. His black friend is upset and gave an ultimatum: stop dating the girlfriend or end the friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the core issue here. The author is in a relationship with someone who has racist views, and this is causing conflict in his life. The question is whether he's at fault. \n\nI know that racism is a serious issue, and supporting or enabling it can be problematic. However, the author is actively trying to address the problem by encouraging his girlfriend to change her behavior. He's not endorsing her racism but is trying to help her. \n\nOn the other hand, his friend feels betrayed and is using a \"bros before hoes\" argument, which is a common but reductive way to frame such conflicts. The author is caught between two important relationships and is not making a choice out of malice but is trying to navigate a difficult situation. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? If he's aware of her racism and is making efforts to address it, then maybe he's not at fault. However, if he's complicit by not confronting her or if his actions are enabling her racism, that could be a different story. The key point is whether he's actively trying to change her behavior. The fact that he's making an effort suggests he's not in the wrong, but it's a complex situation.\n\nAlso, the user's initial thought is that the author is not in the wrong, which aligns with the idea that personal relationships can be complicated, and the author is trying to do the right thing by working on the issue rather than immediately ending the relationship. The friend's ultimatum is harsh, and the author isn't necessarily choosing between them but is dealing with the conflict as best as he can.\n"
