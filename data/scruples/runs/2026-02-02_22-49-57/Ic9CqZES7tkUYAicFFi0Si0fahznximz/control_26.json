She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The situation is that the girlfriend, Diana, is a Ukrainian girl who holds racist views, particularly against Black people. The author is in a new relationship and really likes her, but some friends, including a close Black friend, are upset. The friend gave an ultimatum: choose between the girlfriend or the friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author's girlfriend is racist, which is a serious issue. The author is trying to address it by encouraging her to not express racism, but the girlfriend still makes offensive comments. The friend feels betrayed and is giving an ultimatum. The author is conflicted between the two relationships.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. Racism is a significant problem, and supporting someone who is racist can be harmful. If the girlfriend is making racist remarks, especially in front of others, it's not just about her personal beliefs but also how her actions affect others. The author mentions that he's aware of the cultural context in Eastern Europe, but that doesn't excuse racism. The fact that the girlfriend refuses to change her views after being asked is a red flag.\n\nThe author's friend is right to be upset because the girlfriend's racism directly affects him. Choosing to stay with the girlfriend despite her unwillingness to change could be seen as complicit in her racism. The friend's ultimatum is harsh, but the author's decision to prioritize the girlfriend over the friendship could be seen as prioritizing his romantic interest over standing against racism. However, the friend's approach is also problematic because friendships shouldn't be about ultimatums, especially over complex issues like racism.\n\nThe author is in a tough spot, but staying with a racist partner when they refuse to change could be harmful. It's important to consider the impact on the Black friend and others who might be affected. The author might not be in the wrong for trying to work on the relationship, but if the girlfriend isn't willing to address her racism, then the author could be enabling harmful behavior. The line between being in the wrong and being in a difficult situation is thin here. However, supporting someone's racism, even if it's a cultural issue, is generally considered wrong. So, the answer might lean towards A, but it's nuanced.\n"
