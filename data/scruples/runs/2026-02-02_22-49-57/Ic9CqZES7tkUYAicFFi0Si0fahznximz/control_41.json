She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (AITA) is in the wrong for dating a racist girl. The situation is that the author is in a new relationship with a Ukrainian girl named Diana, who they really like. However, Diana is described as being racist against Black people. The author is trying to address this by not letting her make racist remarks in front of friends and family. But one of the author's friends, who is Black, is upset and giving an ultimatum to either end the relationship or lose the friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is aware of Diana's racism and is making an effort to curb it in their social interactions. However, the friend is using \"bros before hoes\" to force a decision. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for choosing to stick with their girlfriend despite this.\n\nRacism is a serious issue. Even if it's a cultural issue in some parts of Eastern Europe, as the author speculates, that doesn't excuse discriminatory attitudes. The fact that the girlfriend has made specific racist comments, like disliking Black people and not wanting to go to Africa, is problematic. The author is trying to change her behavior, which is commendable, but the friend's reaction is also valid because racism should not be tolerated, especially in someone close to you who is a friend of a Black person.\n\nThe author is caught between two important relationships. The friend is feeling betrayed and is using an ultimatum, which can be hurtful. But the author's responsibility here is to stand against racism. If the girlfriend's racist views are not just occasional comments but part of her core beliefs, and she's unwilling to change, then the author is not in the wrong for continuing the relationship. However, the author should also be aware that supporting a racist partner could affect their own values and relationships with others.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since racism is inherently wrong, the author is in a tough spot. The fact that the author is trying to help their girlfriend is a positive step, but the girlfriend's continued racism, even if not acting on it publicly, might still be a red flag. The friend's ultimatum is extreme, but the author is not necessarily wrong for choosing their partner. However, the author should also consider the impact of staying in the relationship on their social circle and the girlfriend's willingness to address her prejudices. \n\nSo, based on the information, the author's actions of trying to change their girlfriend's behavior are right. The friend's ultimatum is harsh, but the author isn't in the wrong for choosing their partner if they are making efforts. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
