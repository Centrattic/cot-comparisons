She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the guy likes his girlfriend a lot\u2014she's beautiful, smart, funny, etc. But she's racist, specifically against Black people. He's trying to get her to stop being racist, maybe because of his own values or his friends' reactions. His best friend, who is Black, is upset and giving him an ultimatum: break up with her or lose the friend. The guy is conflicted because he doesn't want to choose between them.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's consider the key points. Is dating someone with racist views inherently wrong? It depends on context. If he's aware of her racism and is trying to address it, that shows he cares. However, supporting someone's racist behavior, even if he's trying to change her, could be problematic. Also, his friend feels betrayed, which adds another layer. The friend's reaction might be valid because associating with racists can be harmful, especially if it's directed at someone close to you.\n\nBut the guy isn't necessarily endorsing her racism; he's trying to change her. The challenge here is that changing someone's racist views is difficult and might not be his responsibility. Also, his friend's ultimatum is a bit harsh, but the guy's choice to stay with his girlfriend might be seen as prioritizing his relationship over his friend's feelings.\n\nHowever, the question is about the guy being in the wrong. If he's not actively supporting her racism and is attempting to address it, maybe he's not at fault. On the other hand, if by staying with her he's enabling her views, he could be complicit. The line is blurry here. Since he's making an effort and not fully endorsing her behavior, it might not be his fault. So the answer could be B, he's not in the wrong.\n"
