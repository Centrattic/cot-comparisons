She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The main issue here is balancing personal relationships with supporting friends against racism.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that his girlfriend, Diana, is racist against Black people. He's trying to change her, but she hasn't changed much. His best friend, who is Black, is upset and giving him an ultimatum. The author is conflicted between his girlfriend and his friend.\n\nNow, the key points to consider: Is dating someone with racist views inherently wrong? The user argues that it's not the author's fault if the racism is cultural, and he's trying to address it. But the friend feels betrayed, which is a valid reaction. The author is in a position where he's supporting someone who holds harmful beliefs, which affects his relationship with a friend who directly experiences racism.\n\nI need to evaluate if the author is in the wrong. If someone is in a relationship with a racist person and doesn't take steps to address it, especially when it harms others, they might share some responsibility. However, the author is trying to help Diana change. But the friend's perspective is important too. Supporting a partner who is racist can be seen as complicit in that racism, especially if the partner doesn't change.\n\nThe fact that Diana hasn't changed her views despite the author's efforts might make the author complicit by staying in the relationship. The friend's ultimatum is extreme, but the author's choice to prioritize the girlfriend over a friend who's affected by the racism could be seen as wrong. So the author is in a tough spot, but the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he continues to support someone who is racist, even if it's cultural, he might be enabling that behavior, which could make him at least partially at fault.\n"
