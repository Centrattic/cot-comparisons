She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is he's dating a Ukrainian girl who has racist views against Black people. He likes her a lot and doesn't want to break up, but his friend is upset and giving him an ultimatum: choose between the girlfriend or the friend. The friend is Black, by the way, and has been a best friend for three years.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angles here. Racism is a serious issue. The girlfriend's racism, even if it's part of a cultural background, is still harmful. The author is trying to get her to stop being racist, which is good, but the question is whether he's in the wrong for continuing the relationship despite her racism. \n\nOn one hand, the author is making an effort to address her racism, which is commendable. Relationships require work, and it's possible he's trying to help her change. However, if her racist views are not just personal opinions but something that affects how she treats others or if she's actively discriminatory, that's a problem. The fact that she's expressed dislike for Black people and doesn't want to go to Africa (which could imply negative stereotypes) is problematic. \n\nThe friend's reaction is strong, but \"bros before hoes\" is a problematic phrase itself because it devalues relationships and people of the opposite gender. However, the friend's concern is valid because the author is in a relationship with someone who holds racist views, which can lead to hurtful behavior. The author is in a tough spot, but he needs to consider where he stands on racism. If he values his Black friend's feelings and the importance of opposing racism, then prioritizing the friend might be the right choice. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? If he's aware of her racism and is trying to work on it, but the relationship is still ongoing, does that make him complicit? It's a gray area. However, being in a relationship with someone who's racist could imply some level of acceptance of those views, unless the author is actively challenging them. Since he's making an effort, maybe he's not entirely in the wrong. But if the racism is a deal-breaker for him and his close friends, then staying in the relationship might be seen as wrong. \n\nThe key factors are: the severity of the racism, the author's efforts to address it, and the impact on his friend. If the racism isn't being addressed effectively, and it's causing harm to others, then he might be in the wrong by not taking a stronger stance. Alternatively, if he's genuinely trying, the answer might lean towards not being in the wrong. But since the friend is a victim here (being a Black person facing racism), the friend's hurt feelings are significant. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author is making an effort, the fact that he's choosing to stay in a relationship with someone who is racist, despite the friend's valid concerns, could be seen as being in the wrong. The answer might be A (Yes), because he's not taking a strong enough stand against racism, which is a serious issue. However, if the relationship is still in its early stages and he's actively working on it, the answer could be B (No). But ultimately, supporting someone's racist views, even if it's part of their culture, is problematic, so he might be in the wrong.\n"
