She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girl. So the scenario is that the guy is dating Diana, who is Ukrainian and has racist views against Black people. He's trying to change her, but his friend is upset and giving an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The girlfriend's racism is a problem. The author is in a relationship with her, which might make people question if he's supporting her racism. But he's also trying to address it. His friend, a Black person, is upset and wants him to choose between the girlfriend and the friendship. The friend uses \"bros before hoes,\" which is a problematic phrase because it's sexist and dismissive of relationships. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, he's in a relationship with someone who has racist views. Even if he's trying to change her, being in a relationship with someone who holds such views can be seen as complicity, especially if those views harm others. However, the author isn't the one being racist; he's trying to address it. But the issue is whether he's enabling her racism by staying with her despite her views. \n\nOn the other hand, his friend's ultimatum is also problematic. The phrase \"bros before hoes\" is inherently devaluing of relationships and can be hurtful. The friend is making a choice based on a sexist saying, which might not be the healthiest approach. The author is caught in the middle, trying to maintain both the relationship and the friendship. \n\nHowever, the central issue is the girlfriend's racism. Even if it's a cultural thing, supporting someone who is racist can be seen as wrong, especially if the author is aware of her views and doesn't take a stand. The fact that she made a comment about not liking Black people and not wanting to go to Africa (which is a continent, not a race, so that's a bit of a mix-up) is problematic. The author might be complicit by not confronting her more effectively or by not recognizing the severity of her views. \n\nBut the author is also trying to change her, which shows he doesn't condone her racism. The question is whether continuing the relationship despite her racism is wrong. Some might argue that by being with her, he's not holding her accountable enough. Others might say that relationships are complex and he's trying his best. \n\nIn terms of the friend's ultimatum, the friend's approach is aggressive and not constructive. The author shouldn't have to choose between a friend and a partner based on a hurtful saying. However, the friend is pointing out a serious issue. The author's responsibility here is to address his girlfriend's racism more directly, perhaps by having serious conversations or even considering the relationship's future if she doesn't change. \n\nIn summary, the author's main issue is being in a relationship with someone who is racist. While he's trying to help her, staying in the relationship without her changing might perpetuate the problem. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong if he continues the relationship without addressing the racism effectively. But the answer depends on whether the author is actively supporting her racism or just trying to change her. If he's not endorsing her views and is working to address them, maybe he's not entirely wrong. However, the fact that his friend is a Black person and feels betrayed suggests that the author's actions (by dating a racist) are causing harm, which could make him complicit. So the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he's associating with someone whose views are harmful, even if he's trying to change them. Alternatively, B (not in the wrong) if he's making efforts to address the issue. But I think the consensus would lean towards A because supporting someone with racist views is problematic regardless of intentions.\n"
