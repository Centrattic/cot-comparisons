She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about dating a girlfriend who's racist against Black people, and the friend is giving an ultimatum to break up or lose the friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is in a one-week relationship with Diana, who makes racist comments. The author is trying to address her racism but faces pressure from a friend. The friend, who is Black, feels betrayed and demands a choice between the friend and the girlfriend.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. Racism is a serious issue. The girlfriend's comments about not liking Black people and avoiding Africa are clearly racist. The author is aware of this and is trying to get her to change, which is commendable. However, the author is choosing to continue the relationship despite the racism. \n\nThe friend is upset because of the betrayal. The phrase \"bros before hoes\" is problematic because it devalues the friend's feelings and implies a hierarchy where friendship is less important than romantic relationships. However, the friend's stance is about standing against racism, which is a valid position. The author is caught between personal happiness and supporting a friend who's a victim of racism.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, while the author is trying to address the racism, they are still in a relationship with someone who holds racist views. The fact that the racism is \"cultural\" from Eastern Europe doesn't excuse it. The author might be justifying their choice by considering cultural factors, but that doesn't mitigate the harm caused by racism. \n\nOn the other hand, relationships can be complex, and the author is making an effort to change their partner. However, the key issue is whether the author is complicit by staying with a racist partner. The friend is right to draw a line here, as supporting racism, even unintentionally, can be harmful. \n\nThe author is not in the wrong for trying to address the racism, but they might be in the wrong for choosing to stay in the relationship despite knowing the harm it causes. The friend's ultimatum is harsh, but their concern is valid. So, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they are prioritizing their relationship over supporting their friend against racism, which is a serious issue.\n"
