She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. They're giving a detailed situation where the girlfriend has racist views, mainly against Black people. The author likes her a lot but is facing pressure from a friend who's Black and is giving an ultimatum: break up with the girlfriend or lose the friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The girlfriend is racist, which is a serious issue. The author is trying to address this by asking her not to be racist around friends and family, which is a good step. However, the friend, who is Black, feels betrayed and is making an ultimatum. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for choosing to stay with the girlfriend.\n\nNow, racism is a harmful and offensive belief system. Even if it's a cultural issue, as the author suggests, it's not acceptable. The author is in a position where they have to weigh their relationship with their girlfriend against maintaining a friendship with someone who is directly affected by racism. The friend's reaction, while harsh, is understandable because experiencing racism can be hurtful. The ultimatum is problematic because friendships shouldn't be conditional on sacrificing one's values or respecting others' rights. However, the friend's statement \"bros before hoes\" might devalue the importance of the girlfriend's feelings and the author's autonomy in their relationship.\n\nThe author is trying to mediate the situation by encouraging their girlfriend to change, which is commendable. But the core issue is whether the author is wrong to stay with someone who holds racist views. Even if the author doesn't support the racism, being in a relationship with someone who holds such views can be problematic because it may enable or normalize those attitudes. The author's responsibility is to address the racism in the relationship and decide whether they can accept those views.\n\nIn terms of the author's actions, they are not in the wrong for not immediately breaking up with their girlfriend if they are making efforts to address the racism. However, they need to consider the long-term implications of staying in a relationship where racism is present. The friend's ultimatum is extreme, but the author's choice to prioritize the relationship over the friendship doesn't automatically make them wrong, especially if they are actively working on the issue. However, the presence of racism in a relationship is a significant red flag, and the author should reflect on whether they can tolerate that in a long-term partner.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer hinges on whether the author is complicit in the racism. If they are actively trying to address it and are not endorsing the views, they might not be in the wrong. However, staying in a relationship with someone who is racist, despite efforts to change, may still be problematic. The friend's response is harsh, but the author's choice to stay with the girlfriend isn't necessarily wrong if they are making good-faith efforts to address the issue.\n"
