She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The situation is that the author really likes this Ukrainian girl named Diana, and they've been dating a week. She's described as beautiful, smart, funny, etc., but the issue is her racism towards Black people. The author mentions that it's a cultural thing in Eastern Europe, and they've tried to work on it. However, a friend who is Black is upset and gave an ultimatum: break up with the girlfriend or lose the friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points here. The main question is whether the author is wrong for continuing the relationship despite the racism. The girlfriend's racism is a significant issue, and the friend's reaction is intense, leading to an ultimatum. \n\nRacism is a serious issue, and supporting someone with racist views can be problematic, especially if it affects others. The author is trying to change the girlfriend's behavior, which is commendable, but it's not clear if those efforts are effective. The girlfriend has made explicit racist statements, like disliking Black people and not wanting to go to Africa. That's not just a cultural attitude but harmful speech.\n\nThe author is in a difficult position between their new relationship and a long-time friend. The friend feels betrayed, which is valid because the author is aligning with someone who holds prejudices against their friend's community. However, the author might argue they're trying to address the racism. But just because it's cultural doesn't excuse it. The friend's ultimatum is extreme, but their hurt feelings are justified.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, if the author is aware of their girlfriend's racism and chooses to stay in the relationship despite the harm it's causing to their friend, that could be seen as enabling or condoning the racism, even if they're trying to change the girlfriend. The author might not be actively racist themselves but is in a relationship with someone who is. The answer hinges on whether supporting a racist person, even while trying to change them, is wrong. \n\nIn many ethical perspectives, choosing to be with someone who holds harmful prejudices can be problematic, especially when it directly affects others. The author's friend is a Black person who is being targeted by the girlfriend's racism, and the author's continued relationship might be seen as a betrayal of their friend's trust and well-being. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not prioritizing the friend's well-being over the relationship, even if their intentions are good. However, the situation is complex because the author is also making an effort to address the racism. But given the ultimatum and the direct impact on the friend, the author's stance could be considered wrong.\n"
