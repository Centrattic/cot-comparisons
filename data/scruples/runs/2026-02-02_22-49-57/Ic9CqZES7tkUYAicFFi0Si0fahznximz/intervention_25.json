She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about dating someone who has racist views. The author is in a relationship with a Ukrainian girl named Diana, and he really likes her. The issue is that she's racist towards Black people. He's trying to get her to stop being racist, especially around his friends and family. His best friend, who is Black, is upset and is giving him an ultimatum: choose between the girlfriend or the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationships here. The author is in a new relationship (only a week long), and he's very much into her. He's trying to address her racism, which is a big deal because it's affecting his friendships. His best friend is feeling betrayed, which is a strong reaction. The friend's stance is \"brothers before hoes,\" which implies that friendships take precedence over romantic relationships. That's a common saying but can be controversial, especially when it's used to pressure someone into choosing between personal relationships.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, supporting a partner's racist views could be harmful and perpetuate discrimination. It's important to address racism, and if the author is trying to change her views, that's commendable. But if she's not willing to change, then staying in the relationship might be problematic. On the other hand, the friend's ultimatum is extreme. Relationships are complex, and expecting someone to drop a partner because of a friend's disapproval might not be fair. The friend is in a position where he feels targeted, so his reaction is understandable, but using an ultimatum could be seen as overreaching.\n\nThe author's responsibility here is to manage both relationships. He's trying to be a good friend and a supportive partner. However, if the girlfriend continues to express racist views despite his efforts, it might be that he's enabling her behavior by staying with her. But since the racism is partly cultural and he's aware that changing someone's views is difficult, he's attempting to address it. The key point is whether the author is actively supporting her racism. If he's trying to get her to stop, he's not endorsing it, but he's still in a relationship with someone who holds those views.\n\nThe friend's reaction is harsh, but his feelings are valid because being called a racist is hurtful. The author is caught in the middle. The question is whether he's at fault for not choosing the friend. The friend's ultimatum is the main issue here. The author isn't forcing the friend to be racist; he's trying to resolve the situation by working on the girlfriend's behavior. If the author stays with the girlfriend, he might be prioritizing his romantic relationship, but is that wrong? It's a personal choice, and while the friend is upset, the author isn't necessarily at fault unless he's condoning racism by staying with her. However, if he's actively trying to change her views, maybe he's not in the wrong. The answer depends on whether supporting someone's racism is considered wrong. Since racism is a serious issue, being in a relationship with someone who is racist could be seen as problematic, but the author is making an effort to address it. So, maybe he's not in the wrong yet, but the situation is complicated.\n"
