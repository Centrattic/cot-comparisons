She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The author is in a new relationship with a Ukrainian woman who has expressed racist views against Black people. The author is trying to address this by encouraging her to change her behavior, but a close Black friend is upset and giving an ultimatum: choose between the friend or the girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Racism is generally considered a serious issue, and supporting someone who holds racist views can be problematic, even if it's a cultural issue they're not fully aware of. The author is clearly trying to address the problem by urging his girlfriend to change, which is a positive step. However, the girlfriend's racist statements are harmful, and the author is in a position where a close friend is being directly affected.\n\nThe friend's reaction, while perhaps extreme with the ultimatum, is based on the hurt caused by the girlfriend's comments. The phrase \"bros before hoes\" is a problematic one because it trivializes the issue, but the friend's concern is valid. The author is caught between two important relationships, and the question is whether he's in the wrong for choosing to stay with the girlfriend despite her racism.\n\nIf the author continues the relationship without the girlfriend addressing her racist views, he's enabling that behavior, which could be seen as complicity. On the other hand, if he's actively working with her to change, maybe he's not entirely at fault. But the key here is that the girlfriend has made harmful statements, and supporting someone who makes such statements, even if they're a partner, can be considered wrong. The author's friends are directly being targeted, which adds to the moral dilemma.\n\nThe answer likely depends on whether the author is actively supporting the racist behavior or trying to correct it. The author is trying to correct it, but the girlfriend hasn't changed. The friend's ultimatum is harsh, but the underlying issue is valid. So the author could be seen as in the wrong if he chooses to stay with the girlfriend despite her harmful views, especially since he has the power to address it. However, if he's making a good-faith effort to help her change, maybe he's not. But since the girlfriend hasn't shown signs of changing, continuing the relationship might perpetuate the issue. Therefore, the answer might be A (yes, in the wrong) because he's associating with someone who expresses racism, which is harmful, even if he's trying to change her.\n"
