She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. Let me start by looking at the details provided.\n\nThe author is dating a Ukrainian girl named Diana for a week. He really likes her and feels very happy with her. However, she's described as \"kind of racist,\" specifically against Black people. He mentions that in Eastern Europe, this might be a cultural issue, referencing his dad's stories about Russians threatening Black people during work trips. He's trying to change her behavior, but his friend, who is Black and a close friend for three years, is upset and has given an ultimatum: break up with Diana or lose the friendship. The friend uses the phrase \"bros before hoes,\" which is a bit problematic in itself because it devalues both the relationship and the friend's feelings.\n\nThe author is caught between two important relationships: a romantic one and a friendship. He's trying to address the racism, which is a valid concern. The question is whether he's at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the nature of racism. Racism is a serious issue, and supporting or condoning it can harm others. However, the author isn't a racist himself; he's trying to help his girlfriend change. The problem here is the girlfriend's behavior, not the author's. The friend is upset because the author is in a relationship with someone who expresses racist views, even if the author is trying to address it. \n\nThe friend's ultimatum is harsh. Telling someone they have to choose between their partner and a friend is extreme. It's possible that the friend is prioritizing the friendship over the author's autonomy in his romantic life. However, the friend's stance is also about standing against racism, which is a valid concern. The author might be in a tough spot here because he's trying to support his girlfriend while respecting his friend's feelings.\n\nThe key factors here are: 1) The author is not the one being racist; he's trying to address it in his partner. 2) The friend's reaction is an ultimatum, which is a strong and possibly hurtful approach. 3) The author is trying to navigate this situation without choosing sides immediately.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because he's not the one with racist views. He's making an effort to help his girlfriend and is caught in a difficult situation. The friend's ultimatum is part of the problem here, as it's not allowing for a nuanced discussion about racism and relationships. However, the author should also consider the impact of staying in a relationship where racism exists, even if he's trying to change his partner. But based on the question, the focus is on whether the author is at fault, not necessarily the girlfriend or the friend. \n\nSo, I think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's not personally racist and is trying to address the issue. However, there's a need for him to continue working on his girlfriend's views and perhaps seek ways to support both relationships, but the immediate blame isn't on him.\n"
