She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person (AITA) is in the wrong for dating a racist girl. The situation involves a Ukrainian girlfriend who is racist against black people, and a friend (who is black) is upset and giving an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend's racism is a problem. The user is trying to get her to stop being racist but hasn't succeeded. The friend is making an ultimatum between the girlfriend and the friendship. The user is torn and doesn't want to make that choice.\n\nIs the user in the wrong? Well, dating someone with racist views is a choice. While the user might not be a racist themselves, they are choosing to be in a relationship with someone who holds those views. The user is also aware of the friend's feelings and is trying to address the issue, but the girlfriend hasn't changed. The friend feels betrayed, which is a valid reaction because supporting a racist partner might be seen as complicity.\n\nHowever, changing someone's racism is difficult and not entirely the partner's responsibility. The user isn't forcing the girlfriend to be racist; they're trying to encourage change. But at the same time, by not ending the relationship despite the friend's ultimatum, they are prioritizing their relationship over the friend's feelings. The user is in a tough spot, but whether they're in the wrong depends on their responsibility in the situation.\n\nThe key here is that racism is a serious issue. Associating with someone who holds racist views can be harmful, even if the person isn't a racist themselves. The user is making a choice that their friend sees as a betrayal. While the user might not be actively racist, their choice to stay with the girlfriend could be seen as enabling the racism. However, the user is trying to address the issue, which shows they care about the friend's feelings. But ultimately, if the girlfriend doesn't change, the user is complicit by staying with her.\n\nSo, the answer might be A (the user is in the wrong) because they are choosing to stay with someone who has harmful views, even after being made aware of the impact. However, others might argue that changing someone's deeply held beliefs isn't their responsibility. But in this case, the user is aware of the friend's pain and the girlfriend's racism, so they have a responsibility to consider both parties. Since the user is not making the girlfriend non-racist and is choosing to stay despite the friend's hurt, they might be in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
