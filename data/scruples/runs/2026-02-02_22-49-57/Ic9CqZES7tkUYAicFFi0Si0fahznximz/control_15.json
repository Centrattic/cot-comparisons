She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The situation is that the girlfriend is racist towards Black people, and the author is trying to get her to stop. The friend is upset and giving an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the author is at fault. The girlfriend's racism is the main issue here. The author says they're trying to help her change, but the friend is making a choice between the girlfriend and the friendship. The user wants to know if the author is wrong for staying with the girlfriend.\n\nRacism is a serious issue. Even if it's cultural, it's harmful. The author might be enabling the behavior by staying with someone who is racist. However, the author is also trying to address it. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nThe friend's ultimatum is problematic because it's a toxic thing to say, but the author's decision to stay with the girlfriend despite her racism could be seen as supporting that racism. Even if they're trying to change her, being in a relationship with a racist person can be complicit in their behavior. \n\nThe author might be in the wrong because they're ignoring the harm their girlfriend's racism causes, especially since the friend is a Black person who feels betrayed. The author's responsibility to their friend's feelings and the ongoing racism is important. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they're choosing to stay with someone who is racist, which can perpetuate the issue despite their efforts to change her. Supporting a racist person, even while trying to change them, can enable the harmful behavior and hurt others.\n"
