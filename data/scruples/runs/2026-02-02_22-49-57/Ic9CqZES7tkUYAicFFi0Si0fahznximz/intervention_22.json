She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The user is dating Diana, who is Ukrainian and has racist views against Black people. The user is in Europe, and they mention that racism might be part of the cultural context in Eastern Europe. The user's friend, who is Black, is upset and giving an ultimatum: either stop dating Diana or lose the friendship. The user is trying to mediate but feels pressured.\n\nFirst, the user is trying to address the racism. They mention that curing racism is a long process and they've tried to get Diana to change her behavior. However, Diana's specific racist comments include not liking Black people and not wanting to go to Africa. The user's friend is Kenyan, so the racism is directly affecting someone close to them. The user is caught between their partner and a close friend.\n\nNow, the question is whether the user is in the wrong. On one hand, supporting a partner with racist views could be seen as perpetuating those views, even if the user is trying to change them. On the other hand, the user might not be responsible for their partner's upbringing and cultural background. However, the user has a choice in their own actions. By continuing the relationship despite knowing the partner's racism, they might be enabling it, especially since the friend is directly affected.\n\nThe user's friend is making an ultimatum, which is harsh, but the user's friend has valid concerns. If the user is aware of the racism and doesn't take a stand, they could be seen as complicit, even if they're trying to change the partner. The key point is whether the user is actively supporting the racism by staying with the partner, which might be considered wrong. However, if the user is genuinely trying to address the racism and hasn't given up on changing the partner, maybe they're not entirely at fault. But the fact that they are choosing to stay in the relationship despite the friend's ultimatum could still be seen as prioritizing the relationship over the friend, which the friend perceives as betrayal.\n\nSo, balancing these factors, the user might be in a difficult position, but the act of dating someone with racist views, especially when it's directly affecting a close friend, could be seen as wrong because they are not taking a clear stance against the racism. Even if they're trying to change the partner, their continued presence in the relationship might be enabling the racist behavior. Therefore, the answer might be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong), but I need to check if there's a counterpoint where the user is doing their part and the friend is being too harsh.\n"
