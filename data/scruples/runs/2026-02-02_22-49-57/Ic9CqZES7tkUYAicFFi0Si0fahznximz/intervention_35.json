She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for dating a racist girl. The author is in a relationship with Diana, who has racist views against Black people. The author is trying to address this by encouraging her to change her behavior, but a close Black friend is upset and making an ultimatum: end the relationship or the friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Dating someone with offensive beliefs is a complex issue. The author is not directly racist themselves, but they are in a relationship with someone who is. The key point is whether the author is complicit or responsible for their partner's racism.\n\nThe author is making an effort to address the issue, which is positive. They\u2019re not ignoring it, which is a good step. However, just being in a relationship with someone who holds racist views can be problematic, especially if those views are harmful or exclusionary. The author is caught between their feelings for Diana and their commitment to their friend.\n\nThe friend's ultimatum is harsh, but it's a reaction to the offense caused by the girlfriend's racism. The author might be in a tough spot because they're trying to manage both relationships, but they're not the one expressing racism. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for not breaking up with Diana. \n\nRacism is a serious issue, and while the author is not the one being racist, supporting someone who is can be seen as enabling harmful behavior. However, the author is actively trying to help their partner change. It's a nuanced situation. If the author continues the relationship despite knowing about the racism, are they complicit? Or are they doing their part by addressing it?\n\nI think the answer depends on whether the author is actively supporting and challenging the racism. Since they are trying to get Diana to change, they\u2019re not entirely in the wrong. But there's a responsibility in relationships to be with someone who respects all people. However, changing someone's deeply held beliefs is difficult, and the author's intentions are good. \n\nThe friend's reaction is extreme, but the author isn't the one with the racist views. The main issue is whether the author is wrong for continuing the relationship. Given that they're trying to address it, maybe they're not in the wrong. But there's a gray area here. The answer could be B (Not in the wrong), but with the understanding that the situation is complex and the author should continue to work on the issue.\n"
