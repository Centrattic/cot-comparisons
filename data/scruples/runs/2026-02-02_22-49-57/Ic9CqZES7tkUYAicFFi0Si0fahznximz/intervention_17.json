She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to break it down.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that his girlfriend, Diana, is racist against black people. He lives in Europe, and he acknowledges that Eastern European countries might have cultural issues with racism, possibly stemming from historical or societal factors. He also notes that changing someone's racist views is difficult, something he's tried before. \n\nHe's trying to get her to stop being racist in front of his friends and family. His friend, who is black and a close friend for three years, is upset and giving him an ultimatum: break up with his girlfriend or lose the friendship. The friend uses \"bros before hoes,\" which is a controversial phrase implying that friendships are more important than romantic relationships, especially when race is involved.\n\nThe author is conflicted because he really likes his girlfriend and doesn't want to lose her, but he also values his friend. He's trying to mediate and get his girlfriend to change her views, but the friend isn't budging. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for sticking with his girlfriend despite her racism.\n\nNow, thinking about the ethics here. Racism is a serious issue. The girlfriend's racism is causing harm to the author's friend, who is part of the group being targeted. The author is aware of her racism and is trying to address it, but the friend feels betrayed because the author is in a relationship with someone who holds these views. \n\nOn one hand, the author is taking responsibility by trying to change her behavior, which is commendable. But on the other hand, supporting someone with racist views, even if he's trying to help, might still be harmful. The friend sees it as a betrayal because the author is prioritizing his romantic relationship over the friendship and the well-being of his friend. \n\nThe phrase \"bros before hoes\" is problematic because it's sexist and trivializes the issue. However, the friend's point is that the author is aligning with a partner who is racist against his friend's group, which is a serious matter. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? It depends on perspectives. If the author knows his partner is racist and continues the relationship despite knowing the harm it could cause, especially when a close friend is affected, some might say he's enabling the racism. Others might argue that he's trying to address it and isn't directly responsible for her views. However, the friend's ultimatum is a strong reaction, but the author is caught in the middle.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, while the author isn't a racist himself, by being in a relationship with someone who is, he might be complicit in the harm caused, even if he's trying to change her. The key issue is the impact on his friend. If the author's friend is feeling betrayed and excluded, that's a valid concern. The author's choice to stay with the girlfriend could be seen as prioritizing his romantic relationship over his friend's well-being, which might be considered wrong.\n\nBut then again, the author is making an effort to address the racism. So there's a balance between supporting a partner's growth and recognizing the harm their behavior causes. It's a tough spot. Ultimately, the answer might hinge on whether the author is actively supporting and enabling the racism, which he says he's trying to prevent. However, the friend's perspective is also valid because the racism is real and the author's continued relationship may not be sufficient to mitigate the harm.\n"
