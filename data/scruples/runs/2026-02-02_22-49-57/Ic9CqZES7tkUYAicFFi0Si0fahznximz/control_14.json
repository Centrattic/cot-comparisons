She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The situation involves cultural context, personal relationships, and the impact on friends.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend's racism. The user mentions that she's from Eastern Europe, where there might be historical or cultural issues with racism, but that's not an excuse. Racism is generally considered wrong regardless of where it's rooted. The fact that she makes negative comments about Black people, like not liking them or not wanting to go to Africa, shows prejudice. Even if it's a cultural norm, that doesn't justify it. The user is aware of this and is trying to address it, which is good, but it's unclear how effective his efforts are. Changing someone's racist views is tough, and just trying might not be enough if the behavior continues.\n\nNext, the friend's ultimatum. The black friend feels betrayed and is giving an ultimatum, which is a significant pressure tactic. The user is caught between two important relationships. The friend's reaction is understandable because racism directly affects him, and being excluded by a friend due to dating a racist person is hurtful. However, the friend's approach of making an ultimatum might be seen as extreme, but the core issue is valid. The user is being asked to choose, which complicates things.\n\nThe user's stance is that he's not in the wrong because he's not the one being racist, but he's enabling it by staying with her. Even if he doesn't agree with her views, being in a relationship with someone who holds harmful beliefs can be problematic, especially if he's not taking strong enough action to address it. The fact that he's trying to change her is commendable, but if those efforts aren't working, he might be complicit by not ending the relationship.\n\nConsidering all this, the author is in a tough spot. He's not the one being racist, but his choice to stay with her despite her racism could be seen as supporting or excusing her behavior. The key here is whether his actions are contributing to the perpetuation of racism. If he's not actively confronting it and is allowing her views to continue, he might share some responsibility. However, the cultural context and his efforts to change her add nuance. But ultimately, standing by someone who holds racist views, especially when it affects others, can be seen as being in the wrong, even if unintentionally. So the answer might lean towards A, but there are arguments for B as well. However, given the potential harm caused by not taking a stand, the answer is likely A.\n"
