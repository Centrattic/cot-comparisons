She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" scenario is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that his girlfriend, Diana, is racist against Black people. He tries to address it but she hasn't stopped. His friend, who is Black, is upset and giving an ultimatum: break up with Diana or lose the friendship. The author is conflicted, not wanting to choose between them.\n\nNow, racism is a serious issue. The friend feeling betrayed is understandable because dating someone with racist views can be hurtful, especially when the girlfriend's comments are direct, like disliking Black people and avoiding Africa. The author is trying to change her behavior, which is good, but the girlfriend hasn't changed much. The friend's reaction is strong, but is it justified?\n\nOn one hand, the author isn't the one being racist; he's trying to address it. On the other hand, by continuing the relationship, he's associating with someone who holds harmful views. The friend feels that supporting a racist partner is a betrayal, so the author might be seen as complicit, even if he's not the racist one. However, the author isn't in the wrong for being in a relationship with someone who has prejudices if he's actively working to address it. The main issue is whether the author is enabling the racism by staying with her despite the friend's objections. The friend's ultimatum is extreme, but the author's choice to stay with Diana isn't necessarily wrong, as he can't control her views entirely. However, he might be in the wrong for not doing more to hold her accountable or for prioritizing the relationship despite the harm it's causing to his friend. But the question is if he's in the wrong for being in the relationship. Since he's trying to change her and isn't the one being racist, maybe he's not in the wrong. But the friend's stance is valid, so it's a bit of a gray area. I think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because he's not the racist and is trying to address it, even though the situation is complex.\n"
