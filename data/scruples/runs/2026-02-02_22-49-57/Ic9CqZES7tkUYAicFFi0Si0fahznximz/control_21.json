She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the girl, Diana, is described as racist towards Black people. The author mentions that she doesn't like Black people much and doesn't want to go to Africa. The author is trying to get her to stop being racist, but her friend, who is Black, is upset and giving an ultimatum: choose between the girlfriend or the friend. The author is conflicted and wants to know if they're wrong for staying with the girlfriend.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. Racism is a serious issue. Even if it's a cultural thing, as the author suggests, holding racist views is harmful. The fact that the girlfriend makes offensive statements about Black people is problematic. The author is in a position where they're trying to address this, which is commendable, but the girlfriend isn't showing willingness to change. The friend's reaction, while harsh (using \"bros before hoes\"), is understandable because of the hurt caused by racism. The author is caught between two important relationships but needs to consider whose well-being is more affected. The girlfriend's racism directly impacts others and can lead to more harm if not addressed. The author might not be fully at fault for just dating her, but staying in the relationship without her willingness to change could be seen as complicit in her racism. The author should prioritize ending the relationship if the girlfriend isn't willing to change, which would align with supporting anti-racism. So, the answer would be that the author isn't in the wrong for staying with the girlfriend if she's not changing, but the real issue is whether the author is enabling her racism. However, the question is if the author is in the wrong. Since the girlfriend is the one being racist, the author isn't the one at fault, but they are complicit if they ignore it. The answer is tricky. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer is B (No), because the author isn't the racist one; the girlfriend is. The author is trying to address it, so they aren't wrong for not breaking up yet if there's no progress. But if the author stays with her despite her not changing, that's where the potential fault lies. However, the question is about the current situation, not the future. The answer is B.\n"
