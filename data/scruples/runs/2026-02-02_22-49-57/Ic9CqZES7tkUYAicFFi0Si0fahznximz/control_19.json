She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girl. The scenario is that the author is dating a Ukrainian girl named Diana, who has racist views against Black people. The author is trying to address her racism but is facing pressure from a friend who gives an ultimatum between the girlfriend and the friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author is clearly aware of Diana's racism and is making an effort to address it. The fact that the author is trying to get her to not be racist anymore shows they're not condoning the behavior. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong for continuing the relationship despite her racism.\n\nRacism is a serious issue, and being in a relationship with someone who holds racist views can be problematic, especially if those views are directed at others. The author mentions that Diana's racism is cultural, given the context of Eastern Europe. But even if it's cultural, it's still harmful and perpetuates discrimination. The author is trying to change her views, which is commendable, but changing someone's deeply held beliefs isn't always possible or effective. \n\nThe friend's ultimatum complicates things. The author is being forced to choose between their girlfriend and a close friend. The friend's comment \"bros before hoes\" is problematic in itself because it dismisses the relationship and the individual's feelings. However, the friend is also valid in pointing out that dating someone with racist views can be hurtful, especially to those who are targeted by that racism. The author's black friend is directly affected by the girlfriend's comments, so the friend's stance might be more about defending their own group against harmful attitudes.\n\nNow, considering the author's perspective, they genuinely like the girl and are trying to help her. But is it right to stay in a relationship with someone who is racist? The author isn't actively racist themselves; they're trying to address it. However, by staying with Diana, they might be enabling her views or not taking a clear stance against racism. The line between trying to change someone and being complicit in their harmful behavior is a thin one.\n\nEthically, it's important to support friends and family who are targeted by racism. By choosing to stay with Diana despite her views, the author might be prioritizing their romantic relationship over the well-being of their friend. This could be seen as a betrayal, especially since the friend is a long-time companion. The author's friend's ultimatum is harsh, but the underlying issue is valid. The author needs to reflect on whether they truly oppose racism and if their actions align with that belief.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is in a difficult situation, but from an ethical standpoint, staying in a relationship with someone who holds racist views, even if they're trying to change, might be considered wrong because it can perpetuate harm. The author should consider the impact of their choice on their friend and whether they can effectively address the racism in the relationship. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because supporting a partner's racism, even unintentionally, can be harmful.\n"
