She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking about a situation where he's dating a Ukrainian girl named Diana, who is described as racist towards Black people. He likes her a lot and is happy with her, but his friend, who is Black, is upset and giving him an ultimatum: break up with Diana or lose the friendship. The user is wondering if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The user is in a relationship where one partner holds racist views. The user is trying to address this by encouraging Diana to change her behavior. The fact that he's aware of her racism and is making efforts to change it is a point in his favor. He also mentions that some of his friends, including a Black friend, are upset. The friend is giving an ultimatum, which is a bit extreme, but he's feeling pressured to choose between the relationship and the friendship.\n\nNow, the key question is whether the user is in the wrong. The user is not the one being racist; he's the one trying to address the racism in his partner. However, by continuing the relationship despite her racist views, he might be enabling or condoning that behavior, which could be seen as problematic. But on the other hand, changing someone's deeply held views is difficult, and he's making an effort to work on it.\n\nIs it his responsibility to change her racism? Well, he's in a position where he can influence her views, but it's not his fault if she's racist. However, choosing to be in a relationship with someone who expresses racist views can be seen as supporting those views, even if he's trying to correct them. The ultimatum from his friend adds another layer. The friend feels betrayed, but the user hasn't necessarily done anything to the friend directly. The friend's reaction might be overly harsh, but the user is caught between two people he cares about.\n\nThe user's actions aren't inherently wrong in terms of personal choice in relationships. People have the right to choose their partners, but when it comes to racism, it's a matter of social responsibility. If the girlfriend is making harmful statements and the user isn't taking a strong stand against it, that could be seen as complicity. However, the user is actively trying to address the issue, which shows he's not in complete agreement with her views.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the user isn't in the wrong for dating someone with racist views, especially if he's making genuine efforts to change that. The wrong might lie with the girlfriend for expressing racism and the friend for being overly judgmental and giving an ultimatum. The user is navigating a complex situation where he's trying to balance his feelings, his values, and the expectations of those around him. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
