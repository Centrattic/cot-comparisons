She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the author is dating a Ukrainian girl named Diana who's described as having several positive traits but is also racist against Black people. The author mentions that racism in Eastern Europe might be part of the cultural context. However, the issue arises because the author's friend, who is Black, is upset and giving an ultimatum: either break up with Diana or lose the friendship. The author is trying to navigate this by both trying to make Diana stop being racist and dealing with the friend's demands.\n\nI need to consider a few points here. Racism is a serious issue, and supporting or being in a relationship with someone who holds racist views can be problematic. The author's friend is a victim here, as the girlfriend's racism is causing harm. The author might be in a tough spot because they like Diana but also value their friendship. However, the key question is whether the author is in the wrong for continuing the relationship despite Diana's racist behavior.\n\nThe author is aware of Diana's racism and is trying to address it. However, changing someone's prejudices is difficult and the author might be underestimating the depth of the problem. The friend's ultimatum is extreme, but the author's decision to stay with Diana might be seen as prioritizing the relationship over the friend's well-being. Even if the racism is culturally influenced, the author should consider the impact on others, especially a close friend who is directly affected.\n\nOn the other hand, the author isn't the one being racist; they're trying to help Diana change. But the fact that they are in a relationship with someone who expresses hatred towards another person's race could be seen as complicity, especially if the author doesn't take a firm stance against it. The author's friend has every right to feel hurt and to set boundaries regarding who they associate with when it comes to their close friends.\n\nSo, the author might not be actively racist, but by dating someone who is, they could be enabling that behavior or not showing enough support to their friend. The answer might hinge on whether the author is considered complicit by staying in the relationship despite knowing the racism. Since the author is aware but hasn't ended the relationship, even after the ultimatum, they might be seen as in the wrong for not taking a clear stand against the racism, which harms their friend. Therefore, the answer could be A (yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
