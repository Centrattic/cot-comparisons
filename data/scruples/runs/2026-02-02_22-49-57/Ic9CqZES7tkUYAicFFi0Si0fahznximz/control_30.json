She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girl. The situation is that the author is in a new relationship with a Ukrainian woman who has racist views against Black people. The author is trying to address this, but a close friend (who is Black) is upset and giving an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The girlfriend's racism is a problem, especially since the author has a Black friend who feels betrayed. The author is trying to help the girlfriend change, but there's no sign of progress. The friend is using the \"bros before hoes\" line, which is a problematic phrase that downplays the relationship. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The friend's racism is clearly an issue, and the author is caught between their relationship and their friendship. The author's actions\u2014trying to address the racism and not immediately breaking up\u2014could be seen as making an effort, but they're also allowing someone with racist views to stay in their life. \n\nRacism is a serious issue, and being in a relationship with someone who holds racist beliefs can be problematic, especially if they don't show willingness to change. The author might be enabling the behavior by staying with the partner instead of holding them accountable. However, the author is trying to work on it, so maybe they're not entirely in the wrong. But the friend's ultimatum is also a red flag because it's not healthy to force someone to choose between their partner and their friend. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether supporting a partner with racist views is acceptable. If the partner isn't making efforts to change, the author might be complicit by not taking a stronger stand. However, the author is making an effort to address the issue, which could be a mitigating factor. Still, the presence of racism is a significant problem that can't be ignored. Therefore, the author might be in a tough spot, but their responsibility to their friend and to not condone racism could mean they are in the wrong for not ending the relationship. Alternatively, if the author is genuinely trying to help, they might not be in the wrong. \n\nConsidering the context, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because being in a relationship with someone who is racist, especially when it affects others, can be seen as tacit approval of that racism. However, if the author is actively trying to address it, maybe B (not in the wrong). But the friend's ultimatum is also a problem. The key is that the author should take a stand against racism, even in a partner. So, the answer might be A.\n"
