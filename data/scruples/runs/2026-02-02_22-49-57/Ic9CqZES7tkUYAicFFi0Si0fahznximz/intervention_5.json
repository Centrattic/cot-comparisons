She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The situation is that the guy likes his Ukrainian girlfriend a lot, but she has racist views, especially towards Black people. His friend, who is Black, is upset and giving an ultimatum: end the relationship or lose the friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The girlfriend's racism is a problem. The guy is trying to address it by encouraging her to stop being racist. The friend, however, is taking it very seriously and is using the \"bros before hoes\" line. The user thinks the guy isn't wrong, but they want to know if the answer is A or B.\n\nSo, the main question is about whether the guy is in the wrong by continuing the relationship despite her racism. On one hand, racism is a serious issue, and supporting someone with racist views could be seen as complicit. On the other hand, the guy is making an effort to help his girlfriend change, which shows he's not endorsing her views. Also, the friend is pressuring him, which adds another layer because it's about social relationships and loyalty.\n\nBut the problem here is the girlfriend's racism. Even if it's cultural, it's still harmful. The guy is in a position where he's choosing to stay with her while trying to influence her behavior. However, changing someone's racist beliefs is complex and not always possible. If he's aware of her views and they're unacceptable to his friend and possibly others, is he wrong for not ending the relationship? Or is it his choice as long as he's addressing the issue?\n\nI think the guy isn't in the wrong because he's actively trying to help his girlfriend and isn't promoting her racism. The friend's ultimatum is harsh, but that's the friend's issue, not the guy's. The key is whether the guy is complicit in her racism by staying with her. If he's not supporting her views and is instead working to change her, then he's not in the wrong. However, some might argue that he should end the relationship if he can't accept her views. But since he's making efforts, maybe he's not wrong.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's trying to address the problem and isn't endorsing her racism. The ultimate responsibility lies with the girlfriend and her willingness to change, not the guy for staying with her while trying to help.\n"
