She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girl. The scenario involves a guy who's dating a Ukrainian woman, Diana, who's racist against Black people. He really likes her and is happy, but his friend, who is Black, is upset and giving him an ultimatum: break up with Diana or lose the friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural context. The user mentions that in Eastern Europe, racism might be more prevalent. But just because it's cultural doesn't mean it's acceptable. However, changing someone's views is tough, and the author is trying to address it by asking Diana not to express her racism in front of friends and family. That's a valid approach.\n\nThe key points here are the author's intentions and actions. He's not a racist himself; he's trying to encourage Diana to be more inclusive. The problem is that his friend is taking it as a betrayal. The friend's ultimatum is aggressive and might be overreacting. \"Bros before hoes\" is a problematic phrase because it dismisses the woman's value and the author's autonomy.\n\nThe author isn't forcing Diana to change her views but is working on it. The friend's reaction is extreme. The author's main issue is being caught between two important relationships. His actions show he's trying to balance both, which is reasonable. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nRacism is a serious issue, and dating someone with racist views could be problematic if the person supports or condones that racism. The author, however, is trying to address it and isn't supportive of her views. His choice isn't about endorsing racism but about his personal happiness and relationships. The friend's ultimatum is a form of shaming, which isn't helpful. \n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong because he's making an effort to mitigate the racism and isn't himself racist. The real issue is the friend's overreaction. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
