She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for dating a racist girl. The situation involves a guy in Europe dating a Ukrainian woman named Diana, who has racist views towards black people. His best friend, who is Kenyan, is upset and gave him an ultimatum: choose between the girlfriend and the friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't, but I need to evaluate it more thoroughly. Dating someone who holds racist beliefs is complicated. While the author is trying to address the issue by encouraging Diana to change her views and avoid expressing them, the core problem is that his friend is being directly targeted by her racism. The friend's ultimatum adds pressure, which is a common reaction when someone feels their values are being contradicted by a friend's choices.\n\nThe key factors here are: 1) Is the author's action (dating a racist person) inherently wrong? 2) Is he responsible for his girlfriend's racism? 3) How does the ultimatum from his friend play into this?\n\nDating someone with racist views isn't a moral wrong in itself unless the author is complicit in or perpetuating that racism. However, by choosing to be in a relationship with someone who makes his close friend uncomfortable, the author is creating a conflict. The friend's reaction is harsh, but his feeling of betrayal is valid if the author hasn't addressed the racism effectively. The author is trying to help Diana change, but if she's unwilling or her racism is causing direct harm to others, the situation becomes more problematic.\n\nThe user mentions that the author is trying to get Diana to stop being racist, so he's not uncritically supporting her views. However, the fact that he's in a relationship with someone who openly expresses racist sentiments, especially towards one of his best friends, could lead others to view him as complicit, even if he's trying to help. The phrase \"bros before hoes\" is toxic because it prioritizes friendships over relationships, which isn't a healthy dynamic. But the friend's stance is based on the girlfriend's racism, which is a serious issue.\n\nCultural factors are mentioned, but racism is a personal choice and behavior, not just a cultural norm. The author's approach to changing her views might not be sufficient, and if the friend is being directly affected (e.g., if Diana's racism is causing him harm or disrespect), the author might share some responsibility for not intervening enough. The answer hinges on whether the author is enabling the racism or making a good-faith effort to address it. The user believes the author is not in the wrong, so I need to consider if that's a fair assessment.\n\nIn the end, it's a tricky situation. The author isn't necessarily at fault for dating her, but he's in a position where his choice is causing harm to a close friend. The friend's ultimatum is extreme, but the author's responsibility lies in his own actions and how he handles the relationship. If he's actively trying to address her racism but she's not changing, the blame is more on Diana. However, the conflict between the two friends is significant. I think the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong for dating her, but there's nuance because of the impact on his friend. The main issue is the girlfriend's racism, not the author's decision to date her, provided he's not endorsing it. The friend might be overreacting, but the author should continue to work on the situation.\n"
