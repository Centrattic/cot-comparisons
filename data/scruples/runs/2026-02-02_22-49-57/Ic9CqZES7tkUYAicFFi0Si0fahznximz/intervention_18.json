She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The author is defending their choice by saying it's a cultural issue and that changing someone's racism is hard. They mention that their friend is making an ultimatum between the relationship and friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author is at fault. The key points here are the girlfriend's racism and the friend's ultimatum. The author is aware of the racism but continues the relationship. They're also trying to change her behavior, which is commendable, but does that absolve them?\n\nRacism is a serious issue, and supporting someone who holds racist views can be problematic. The author likes the girl and finds her attractive, which is understandable, but that doesn't justify staying in a relationship where someone is being racist. The fact that the girlfriend made explicit racist remarks (like not liking Black people and not wanting to go to Africa) is a red flag. \n\nThe friend's ultimatum is harsh, but it's rooted in the fact that the author is prioritizing the girlfriend over a long-term friendship. The phrase \"bros before hoes\" is derogatory and suggests that the friend values the friendship more than the relationship. However, the author is being asked to choose between two important relationships, which is tough. \n\nThe author argues it's a cultural thing, but that doesn't excuse racism. Everyone should be held accountable for their views. The author's responsibility here is to not support or enable racism. Even if they're trying to change their girlfriend, actively staying with someone who is racist could be seen as complicit. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might be in a tough spot, trying to balance their feelings and friendships. But the core issue is the girlfriend's racism. The author is in a position where they should address this, possibly end the relationship if the racism isn't addressed, or at least not defend it. Since the girlfriend has made discriminatory comments, the author's choice to stay with her might be seen as condoning those views. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because they're choosing to remain in a relationship with someone who has racist views despite knowing the impact it has on their friend and others.\n"
