She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The situation involves a guy dating a Ukrainian woman who makes racist comments against Black people. His friend, who is Black, is upset and giving him an ultimatum to choose between the relationship or the friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author mentions that racism is more culturally accepted in Eastern Europe, which might explain some of his girlfriend's views. However, he's trying to get her to stop expressing those views. The friend is upset because the author is in a relationship with someone who is racist, and he feels betrayed. The author is caught between his new relationship and a long-term friendship, and the friend is taking a hard stance.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's think about the ethics here. Supporting a partner who expresses racist views can be problematic, especially if those views are directed at people you know. The author's friend is part of the group targeted by the girlfriend's racism, so his feelings of betrayal are understandable. The author might not be directly racist himself, but by continuing the relationship, he could be enabling or not addressing the racism adequately. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to change his girlfriend's views, which is a good step. He might not be in the wrong if he's actively working on the issue. However, if he's aware of the racism and doesn't take a clear stance against it, he might be complicit. The line between supporting a partner's personal growth and allowing harmful behavior is thin here. \n\nThe friend's ultimatum is harsh, but his feelings are valid given the situation. The author's challenge is balancing both relationships without fully committing to one over the other. However, the friend's perspective is that the author is choosing to associate with someone who holds racist views, which directly affects him. \n\nIn terms of cultural context, while some behaviors might be more tolerated in certain regions, that doesn't excuse racism. The author might be trying to navigate cultural differences, but that shouldn't justify harmful attitudes. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might not be in the wrong if he's making efforts to address the racism. However, there's a risk that by not taking a stronger stance, he's inadvertently supporting the racist behavior. The answer hinges on whether the author is actively helping his girlfriend change her views or if he's just ignoring the issue. Since the post mentions he's trying to get her to stop, it leans towards him not being in the wrong. But there's a nuance here\u2014supporting someone while they change versus enabling their harmful behavior. If the girlfriend's racism isn't being adequately addressed, the author could be seen as complicit. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong at this point, given that he's making efforts. \n\nThe answer could be B (Not in the wrong) if the efforts are genuine and ongoing. However, if the racism persists and he doesn't take stronger action, that could shift. But based on the current information, he's trying, so B might be the right choice.\n"
