She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The situation involves the girlfriend being racist against Black people, which the author is aware of. The author is trying to address her racism but is facing pressure from a friend who is Black to choose between the relationship and the friendship. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend's racism is a significant issue. The author is making an effort to change her behavior, which is commendable, but the friend feels betrayed because the girlfriend's racism affects their friendship. The friend is setting an ultimatum, which is problematic in itself because it's a black-and-white choice that doesn't allow for dialogue or compromise.\n\nThe author's stance is that they like the girlfriend and want to work on her racism, but the friend is making it an either/or situation. The question is whether the author is in the wrong by choosing to stay with the girlfriend despite her racism.\n\nRacism is a serious issue. Even if the girlfriend's views are culturally influenced, holding racist beliefs and expressing them, especially in front of others, is harmful. The author is in a position where they are supporting someone who has prejudiced views, which can be hurtful to others, including the Black friend. The friend's reaction, while extreme, comes from a place of being directly affected by the girlfriend's racism.\n\nThe author might argue that they are trying to change the girlfriend's behavior, but changing someone's deeply held beliefs is a long and difficult process. However, supporting a partner who is racist can be seen as condoning that behavior, especially if the author doesn't actively challenge it. The fact that the girlfriend made specific racist comments (disliking Black people and not wanting to visit Africa) is problematic. The author's friend, who is Black, feels betrayed, which adds another layer of personal offense.\n\nIn terms of ethics, being in a relationship with someone who is racist could be seen as the author enabling that racism unless they are actively and effectively working to change the behavior. The author's responsibility here might be to address the racism more directly, even if it's challenging. The friend's ultimatum is not the best approach, but the author's choice to prioritize the relationship over the friend's well-being could be seen as wrong because it perpetuates harm against someone else.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author is in a tough spot, but their decision to stay with the girlfriend despite her racism might be in the wrong, especially if the racism is actively hurting others and they are not doing enough to address it. The answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
