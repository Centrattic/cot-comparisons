She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for dating a girl they consider racist. The situation is that the author is in a new relationship with a Ukrainian woman named Diana, who has some racist views against Black people. The author's friend, who is Black, is upset and giving an ultimatum to either stop seeing the girlfriend or lose the friendship. The author is trying to handle it by getting Diana to stop her racist behavior and is conflicted.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points here. The main issue is the girlfriend's racism. The author is defending their choice, suggesting that it's a cultural thing in Eastern Europe and that changing someone's racist views is difficult. They mention that their friend is a Kenyan and feels betrayed. The friend's statement \"bros before hoes\" is a bit problematic because it's a clich\u00e9 and can be seen as disrespectful to both the author's relationship and to women in general. The author is trying to mediate but faces an ultimatum.\n\nNow, the user thinks the author is not in the wrong. I need to assess if that's the case. Let's consider the ethical aspects. Dating someone with prejudiced views might not be the author's fault, but they have a responsibility in their relationship. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for choosing to stay with the girlfriend despite her racism.\n\nRacism is a serious issue. Even if it's culturally prevalent, it's still harmful. The author's friend is valid in feeling hurt, especially since the girlfriend's comments were made in front of him. The friend's ultimatum is extreme, but his concern is about the author's support and the girlfriend's attitude. The author is trying to address the racism, which is commendable. However, the girlfriend's willingness to change is crucial. If she's open to self-reflection and growth, maybe the author can work with her. But if her racism is unyielding, the author's continued relationship could be seen as condoning or enabling that prejudice, even if unintentionally.\n\nThe author's argument that racism is hard to cure and it's cultural might be a way to justify staying with the girlfriend. However, just because something is common in a culture doesn't mean it's acceptable. The author is in a position where they can either support their friend's feelings or support their girlfriend's views. The friend's reaction, while harsh, is about the author's stance on racism. The author might be in a moral dilemma here, but the issue isn't just about the girlfriend's racism\u2014it's also about how the author handles it and where they stand personally.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They are not directly responsible for the girlfriend's racism, but by choosing to stay in the relationship and not clearly opposing her views, they might be seen as complicit. The friend's ultimatum is extreme, but the author's handling of the situation could affect their own moral standing. If the author continues the relationship without addressing the racism effectively, they could be supporting a harmful ideology. On the other hand, if they are actively working with the girlfriend to change, that's different. The problem is that the girlfriend might not be willing to change, and the author's insistence on continuing could be wrong.\n\nBut the author is trying to get the girlfriend to stop being racist. They might not be in the wrong for dating her, but if they are aware of her racism and don't take a firm stand, they could be. It's a bit of a gray area. The key factors are the girlfriend's openness to change, the author's efforts to address the issue, and the potential impact of the relationship on others. The friend's reaction, while heavy-handed, is a response to the girlfriend's racism. The author's choice to prioritize the girlfriend over the friendship might not be entirely their fault, but it's a tough call. However, the user's own statement says they're trying to get the girlfriend to stop, so maybe they're not in the wrong. But if the girlfriend isn't changing, the author might be enabling the racism. So the answer could be B (No) because the author is not directly responsible for her racism and is attempting to address it. However, some might argue that by staying with her despite known racism, the author is in the wrong. But given that the girlfriend hasn't been violent or caused direct harm, and the author is making efforts, B might be the choice.\n"
