She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating a girl who's racist, specifically against black people. The author is in a European country, and his girlfriend is Ukrainian. He mentions that in Eastern Europe, there might be some cultural issues with racism, but he's trying to help her change her views. His friend, who is black, is upset and giving him an ultimatum to choose between the girlfriend and the friendship. The user wants to know if the author is wrong (A) or not (B).\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The girlfriend is racist, which is a serious issue. The author is aware of her racism and is trying to address it, but his friend is upset. The author is trying to balance both the relationship and the friendship. However, the key points here are about the author's responsibility in dating someone with racist views.\n\nRacism is a significant problem, and being in a relationship with someone who holds such views can be problematic. Even if the author is trying to help her change, the presence of racism in the relationship can affect others, especially when it leads to conflict with friends. The friend's reaction is about feeling betrayed, which the author might not see as a betrayal since he's not actively endorsing the racism. However, by choosing to stay with the girlfriend despite her views, the author might be enabling her behavior, even if he's trying to correct it.\n\nThe author's approach is to work on changing her views, but that's a long process. The question is whether he's in the wrong for not breaking up with her. The friend's ultimatum is harsh, but the author's decision to prioritize the relationship over the friendship could be seen as a personal choice. However, the issue here is whether the author is wrong for being in a relationship with a racist person. \n\nIn many perspectives, supporting or being in a relationship with someone who is racist is problematic because it can perpetuate harmful attitudes. The author might not be directly racist himself, but he's in a relationship with someone who is, which can reflect on him, especially if he doesn't take a clear stance against her racism. However, the author is making an effort to change her views, which complicates the issue. It's possible that he's not in the wrong if he's actively working to address the racism, but the situation is complex.\n\nOn the other hand, if the racism is causing harm to others, like his black friend, then the author might be at fault for not taking the relationship more seriously and not protecting his friend's feelings. The ultimatum from the friend is extreme, but the author's choice to stay with the girlfriend despite the friend's feelings could be seen as prioritizing the girlfriend over the friend's well-being. However, it's also possible that the author is trying to handle both the relationship and the friendship, even if it's not resolving the issue.\n\nIn terms of the options, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer would depend on whether being in a relationship with a racist person is considered wrong. Some might argue that it's not his fault if the racism is cultural and he's trying to address it. Others might say that he's complicit by not ending the relationship. The friend's reaction is valid because racism is harmful, so the author's choice to stay with the girlfriend could be seen as supporting her views, even if he's trying to change them. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not ending the relationship when it's causing harm to others.\n"
