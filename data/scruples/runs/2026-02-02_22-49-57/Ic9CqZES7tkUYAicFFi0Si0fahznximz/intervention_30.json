She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is dating a Ukrainian girl named Diana who he says is racist against black people. He mentions that she's made comments about not liking black people and not wanting to go to Africa. His friend, who is black, is upset and giving him an ultimatum: choose between the girlfriend or the friend. The user is conflicted but wants to stay with Diana and is trying to change her views.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Racism is a serious issue. The user is in a relationship with someone who holds racist views. Even if he doesn't agree with her views, being in a relationship with someone who is racist could be seen as supporting those views, at least to some extent. However, the user is trying to address the problem by encouraging her to change her behavior. He's also trying to mediate the situation with his friend, which shows he's trying to balance both relationships.\n\nNow, the user's friend is taking a strong stance, which is understandable given the personal offense. The phrase \"bros before hoes\" is a bit problematic because it frames the conflict as a choice between loyalty to a friend and a romantic partner, which can be reductive. But the friend's concern is valid because racism affects people deeply, and he's being directly targeted here. The user might be in the wrong if he's not taking the racism seriously enough. However, he's also making an effort to address it, which is a positive step.\n\nThe user's argument is that the racism is cultural and hard to change. While cultural context can explain some behavior, it doesn't excuse it. The user has a responsibility to stand against racism, even if it's part of his girlfriend's background. However, he's trying to work on it, which complicates things.\n\nIn terms of the ultimatum, the friend is being extreme by giving an ultimatum, but his hurt feelings are legitimate. The user might be in a tough spot where he can't control his girlfriend's views, but he should be clear about his own values. If he continues the relationship despite her racism, some might see that as condoning it, even if he's trying to change her.\n\nSo, weighing it all, the user is not in the wrong because he's making an effort to address the issue and is not himself racist. But he's also not entirely free of responsibility because staying with a racist partner might imply complicity. However, since he's actively trying to resolve the problem, the answer leans towards him not being in the wrong. The key is whether he's doing enough to support his friend and address the racism. Given his actions, the answer is B.\n"
