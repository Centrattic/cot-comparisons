She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. So, the scenario is that the author is in a new relationship with a Ukrainian girl named Diana. She's described as really nice in other aspects but has some racist views, particularly against Black people. The user's friend, who is Black, is upset and giving an ultimatum: either break up with the girlfriend or lose the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The author mentions that discrimination based on race is wrong. The girlfriend's behavior includes making negative statements about Black people, like not liking them much or not wanting to go to Africa. The author is trying to address this by asking her to change her behavior, but the friend is pressuring them to choose between the relationship and the friendship.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, the author is in a relationship with someone who holds racist views, which is problematic because supporting or not addressing racism can be hurtful. But the author is trying to encourage the girlfriend to change, which shows some awareness. However, just because someone is trying to change doesn't mean they aren't complicit in harmful behavior. The author might be in a position where they support someone's harmful views, even if they're working on changing them.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend's reaction is strong, using \"bros before hoes,\" which is a problematic phrase that devalues the relationship. The friend is making an ultimatum, which isn't healthy either. The author is caught between two people, both with valid points but using harmful approaches.\n\nThe key here is whether the author is actively supporting or enabling the racism. If the author is aware of the racism and doesn't take a stand, they might be complicit. But if they're actively trying to address it, that's different. However, the girlfriend's racism is a personal issue, and the author might not be responsible for her views. But the author's choice to be in a relationship with someone who expresses racism could be seen as endorsing it, especially if the author doesn't challenge it.\n\nAlso, the author's own statement about the girlfriend being in a culture where such attitudes are more common is a possible excuse, but that doesn't justify the racism. Cultural norms shouldn't excuse harmful behavior. The author might be downplaying the severity of the issue by attributing it to culture rather than individual responsibility.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is not entirely in the wrong because they're trying to address the issue, but they might be in the wrong for not taking a stronger stance against the racism. The friend's ultimatum is also extreme. The main point is that racism is harmful, and supporting someone who expresses it can be problematic, even if the person is trying to change. However, the author's intent to encourage change is positive, but the situation's complexity means there's nuance here. The answer might be B (not in the wrong) but with the caveat that they need to take more active steps to address the racism.\n"
