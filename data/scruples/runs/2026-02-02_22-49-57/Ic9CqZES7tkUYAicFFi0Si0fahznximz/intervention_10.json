She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's start by understanding the situation here. The user is dating a girl named Diana, who is Ukrainian and exhibits some racist views towards Black people. The user is in Europe, so maybe the cultural context is different from where they discussed racism. The user's friend, who is Black, is upset that the user is dating Diana and has given an ultimatum: choose between the friend or the girlfriend. The user is conflicted and wants to know if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The user is trying to address Diana's racism by encouraging her to not express those views in front of friends and family. The friend's reaction is strong, but the user feels they're not betraying anyone. The question is whether the user is in the wrong by choosing to stay with Diana despite her racism.\n\nThe user's perspective is that changing someone's racist views is a long process, and they're making an effort. However, the friend feels betrayed because the user is supporting a partner who holds such views. The user is caught between two important relationships and is being forced to make a choice. \n\nNow, evaluating the user's actions: They are aware of Diana's racism and are trying to work with her. But does that justify continuing the relationship? On one hand, the user might believe they can influence change, but on the other, associating with someone who has racist views can be hurtful and harmful, especially to the Black friend. The user's friend feels that by dating a racist person, the user is complicit or supportive of that racism, which is why they're upset. \n\nThe user is in a difficult position, but the question is about their responsibility. If the user is aware of the racism and chooses to stay in the relationship, they might be enabling that behavior. However, the user is also trying to address the issue. The key here is whether the user is in the wrong for continuing the relationship despite knowing the racist tendencies. \n\nAnother angle: The user's friend is making a valid point about the harm caused by racism. The user's choice to prioritize the girlfriend over the friend could be seen as choosing a problematic partner over a supportive friend. But cultural context is mentioned\u2014maybe racism in Eastern Europe is more prevalent, but that doesn't excuse it. The user's responsibility is to not support or endorse racism, even if it's part of the culture. \n\nIn terms of the user's actions, they are attempting to change Diana's views, which is commendable. However, if Diana's racism is a core part of her beliefs that aren't changing, the user might be complicit by staying with her. The user's friend is within their rights to be upset, but the user isn't necessarily at fault for being in a relationship with someone who has flaws. However, the user might be in the wrong if they are not actively challenging the racism enough or if they are enabling it.\n\nBut the user is making an effort. The question is whether that's enough. If the user is trying to work on it, maybe they aren't in the wrong. However, if the racism continues and they choose to ignore it, that's different. The user is in a complex situation, and the answer might depend on how actively they're addressing the issue. Since the user is trying to change Diana's behavior, they might not be at fault. But if they're aware of the harm and still prioritize the relationship without significant effort, that's a problem. \n\nGiven the information, the user is making an effort, so the answer could be that they aren't in the wrong. But the cultural context and the friend's hurt feelings complicate things. The key is whether the user is actively trying to address the racism. The user says they are, so maybe they're not in the wrong. But if the racism isn't being addressed, then they might be.\n"
