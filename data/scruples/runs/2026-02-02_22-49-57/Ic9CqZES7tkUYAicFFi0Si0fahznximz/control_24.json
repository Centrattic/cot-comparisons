She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The situation is that he's in a relationship with a Ukrainian girl named Diana who has racist views against black people. He's trying to address her racism, but his friend, who is black, is upset and giving him an ultimatum. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girl is racist, which is a serious issue. The author is trying to change her behavior, but she's not making progress. His friend is a black person who feels betrayed and is threatening to end the friendship if the author doesn't end the relationship. The author is caught between his girlfriend and his friend.\n\nRacism is a major problem, and supporting someone who holds racist views can be harmful. The author might be enabling her racism by staying with her instead of leaving. Even if he's trying to help her change, if she's not willing to do the work, it's problematic. The friend's reaction is understandable because the author is in a relationship with someone who has racist views, which can affect the black friend's feelings of safety and respect.\n\nThe author is facing a tough choice, but dating someone with racist views can be seen as complicit, even if he's not racist himself. The answer might depend on whether the author is actively supporting her racism or trying to address it. However, if the girlfriend isn't changing, staying in the relationship might still be wrong because it's harmful to others. The friend's ultimatum is harsh, but the author's decision to prioritize the relationship over the friendship might be seen as the wrong choice because it's upholding a racist environment.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might not be responsible for her racism if he's actively trying to help her change. But racism is a personal issue, and if she's not willing to change, the author's continued support could perpetuate the problem. So, the answer could lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because he's maintaining a relationship with a racist person despite knowing the impact on others.\n"
