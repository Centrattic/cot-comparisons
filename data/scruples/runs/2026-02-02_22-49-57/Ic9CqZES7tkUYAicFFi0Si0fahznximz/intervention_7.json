She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The situation is that the author really likes his Ukrainian girlfriend, Diana, who he's been with for a week. He mentions she's racist towards Black people, which he thinks might be cultural since he's in Eastern Europe. His friend, who is Black, is upset and giving him an ultimatum: break up with her or lose the friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is trying to change her behavior, which shows he's aware of the issue and is making an effort. But his friend's reaction is pretty harsh, using \"bros before hoes,\" which is a problematic phrase itself. The question is whether the author is wrong for choosing not to break up with her yet.\n\nOn one hand, the girlfriend's racism is a serious issue. Racism is a significant problem, and supporting it by staying with someone who is racist could be seen as complicit. However, the author is in the early stages of the relationship and is actively trying to address her behavior. It's his first week, so maybe he's giving her the benefit of the doubt, thinking it's cultural. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend's ultimatum is extreme. The author shouldn't have to choose between his relationship and his friend, especially when the friend is using a toxic phrase. The friend's reaction might not be fair if the author is genuinely trying to address the racism. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong? Well, supporting someone who's racist could be seen as a problem. However, if he's making an effort to change that behavior and isn't condoning the racism, maybe he's not the asshole. The friend's behavior is more concerning because they are pressuring the author into a choice that's not healthy. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't wrong, but maybe there's nuance. The author might be in a difficult position, but the real issue is the girlfriend's racism and the friend's ultimatum. The answer hinges on whether supporting someone with racism is wrong. If the author is actively trying to address it, maybe he's not at fault. But if he's enabling her behavior, that's different. Since he's trying to help her change, perhaps he's not in the wrong.\n"
