She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that he's dating a Ukrainian girl named Diana who's racist against Black people. He's happy with her but his friend, who is Black, is upset and giving him an ultimatum: break up with Diana or lose the friend. The author is struggling with this and wants to know if he's in the wrong by choosing to stay with his girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author mentions that Diana is racist, but he's trying to change her. However, the racism is described as a cultural issue from Eastern Europe. He's trying to get her to not express racism in front of his friends and family. The friend who's Kenyan is upset and is making an ultimatum. The author is caught between his girlfriend and best friend.\n\nNow, thinking about the question: Is the author in the wrong? The options are A for yes and B for no. The user's initial thought is that the author isn't in the wrong, but they want another opinion.\n\nLet me break it down. Racism is a serious issue. If the girlfriend is expressing racist views, that's harmful. But the author is trying to address it. However, the friend is giving an ultimatum, which complicates things. The author is trying to navigate both relationships. \n\nBut is the author in the wrong for choosing to stay with his girlfriend? If he's aware of her racism and is making an effort to address it, maybe he's not entirely at fault. However, if he's enabling her racism by not taking a stronger stance, perhaps he is contributing to the problem. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend's ultimatum is problematic. \"Bros before hoes\" is a toxic mindset that prioritizes friendships over relationships in a way that can be dismissive of the person in the relationship. The friend is making a choice that could be harmful to the author's personal life. \n\nSo, who's more in the wrong here? The author is trying to handle a difficult situation, but if he's aware of his girlfriend's racism and doesn't take enough steps to address it, he might be complicit. However, changing someone's deeply held beliefs is complex, and he's attempting to work on it. The friend's ultimatum is also an issue because it's pressuring the author to choose, which can be hurtful. \n\nIn terms of the original question, the author is trying to balance both relationships. The key is whether he's in the wrong for staying with the girlfriend despite her racism. If he's making an effort to address it, maybe he's not in the wrong. But if he's ignoring the racism, then he could be. The post says he's trying to get her to change, so perhaps he's not the one in the wrong. The friend's reaction is more problematic because of the ultimatum. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because he's making an effort and the friend's ultimatum is the bigger issue. However, there's a nuance here. The author's responsibility in not being complicit in racism is important. If he's staying with her despite knowing her racism without taking concrete steps to address it, he might be in the wrong. But the post says he's trying to help her change, so maybe he's not at fault. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B, but there's a lot to unpack. The friend's ultimatum is definitely problematic, but the author's situation isn't entirely his fault if he's making an effort. So, the answer is B.\n"
