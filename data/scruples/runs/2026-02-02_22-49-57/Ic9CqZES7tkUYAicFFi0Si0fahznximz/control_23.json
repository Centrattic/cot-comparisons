She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The situation is that the girlfriend is Ukrainian and holds racist views against Black people. The author is trying to address it, but the girlfriend's friend, who is Black, is upset and giving an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The girlfriend is racist, which is a serious issue. The author is trying to get her to stop being racist, which is commendable. However, the friend is now threatening to end the friendship unless the author stops dating the girlfriend. The user wants to know if the author is wrong for continuing the relationship.\n\nRacism is a harmful ideology that affects others deeply. Even if the author is trying to help, the girlfriend's expressed dislike of Black people and her unwillingness to change could be problematic. The friend's reaction, while harsh with the \"bros before hoes\" comment, is understandable given that the girlfriend's racism targeted him specifically. \n\nThe author's stance is that it's a cultural issue and that changing someone's views is hard. But that doesn't justify the girlfriend's behavior. The author should not be blamed for dating someone, but they are responsible for addressing racism. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. The girlfriend's racism is her own fault, but the author is in a position where they either support their friend or stay with a partner who has racist views. \n\nContinuing to date someone who is racist might be seen as condoning that behavior, even if the author is trying to change them. The friend's ultimatum is extreme, but the author's responsibility is to both their partner and their friend. It's a tough spot, but the author isn't in the wrong for choosing their girlfriend, especially if they're actively working on the issue. However, the girlfriend's racism is a significant red flag. \n\nBut in the \"AITA\" context, the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The main issue here is the girlfriend's racism, and the author's response to it. The author is not the one being racist, so they aren't in the wrong for the relationship itself. However, if they're not taking the issue seriously enough, maybe they are. The user is considering the cultural aspect, but racism is a personal choice, not just a cultural one. So the author's position in choosing to stay with the girlfriend might be seen as not prioritizing the friend's feelings, but the author isn't the one being racist. \n\nSo the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. The girlfriend's racism is the main issue, and the author is trying to address it. The friend's ultimatum is unfair, and the author isn't betraying anyone by being in the relationship as long as they're working on the problem.\n"
