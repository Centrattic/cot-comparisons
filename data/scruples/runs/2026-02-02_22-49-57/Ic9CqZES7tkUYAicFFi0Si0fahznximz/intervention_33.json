She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girl. The situation is that the author is dating Diana, who is Ukrainian and has racist views against Black people. He mentions that it's a cultural issue, and he's trying to change her behavior but faces an ultimatum from a black friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The author is in a relationship with someone who holds racist views. He likes her a lot, but her racism is causing conflict with his friend. The friend feels betrayed and demands a choice between the girlfriend and friendship. The author is trying to mediate, but the friend isn't budging.\n\nThe key points are: 1) The author is aware of her racism. 2) He's trying to address it but hasn't seen results. 3) His friend feels he's betraying him by dating her. 4) The friend is using a \"bros before hoes\" ultimatum.\n\nNow, is the author in the wrong? Well, supporting a partner's racism is problematic. Even if it's cultural, enabling or not addressing it can perpetuate harmful attitudes. The author's friend is pointing out the injustice of the situation. However, the author might not be a racist himself; he's trying to help her change. But by being in a relationship with someone who is racist, he could be complicit in that racism, especially if he's aware and doesn't act.\n\nBut the question is about whether he's in the wrong. If he's actively trying to address her racism, maybe he's not. However, the fact that she's making racist comments and he's continuing the relationship despite his friend's objections might indicate that he's prioritizing the relationship over standing against racism. That could be seen as wrong, especially if he's aware of the harm her views cause.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might not be the one being racist. It's complex because relationships involve personal choices. The friend's ultimatum is harsh, but his concerns are valid. However, the author isn't the one with the racist views\u2014Diana is. So is he in the wrong for dating someone with those views? Maybe not directly. But he's in a position where he should consider the impact of supporting her and whether he's enabling her behavior.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author is actively supporting or condoning her racism. If he's trying to change her, he might not be in the wrong. But if he's knowingly associating with someone who holds racist views without addressing it, that could be problematic. However, the question is about the author's wrongdoing. Since he's making an effort to address it, perhaps he's not in the wrong. So the answer might be B.\n"
