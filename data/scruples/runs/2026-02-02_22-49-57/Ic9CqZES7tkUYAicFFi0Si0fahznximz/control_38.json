She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The situation is that the girlfriend is racist towards Black people, which the author is trying to address. The author's friend, who is Black, is upset and giving an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The girlfriend's racism is a problem. The author is trying to change her views, but the friend feels betrayed. The friend is using \"bros before hoes,\" which is a problematic phrase because it devalues the relationship with the girlfriend. \n\nThe author is caught between two people he cares about. The question is whether he's in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, supporting racism is not acceptable. However, the author isn't the one being racist; he's the one trying to address it. But the fact that he's continuing the relationship despite knowing her racism might be an issue. \n\nAlso, the friend's ultimatum is aggressive and could be contributing to the problem. The author is trying to navigate this conflict, but the main issue is the girlfriend's prejudice. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong for trying to work through the situation, but there's a responsibility to address the racism. However, the answer might depend on whether the author is complicit in her racism or not. Since he's trying to get her to change, he's not fully in the wrong. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
