She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The main issue here is the girlfriend's racism and the conflict between the author and his friend.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that the girlfriend is racist towards Black people. He's trying to get her to stop making racist comments, especially in front of his friends and family. The friend, who is Black, is upset and giving an ultimatum: the author must choose between the girlfriend or the friendship. The friend uses \"bros before hoes,\" which is a phrase that prioritizes male friendship over romantic relationships, often criticized for being sexist and dismissive of the value of relationships with women.\n\nNow, considering the author's stance, he's not defending the racism but is trying to address it. He's aware that racism is a serious issue and is making an effort to help his girlfriend change. The friend's ultimatum is problematic because it reduces a complex issue into a binary choice and uses a sexist phrase. It's important to note that while racism is wrong, the author is not perpetuating it; he's trying to address it in his partner.\n\nHowever, there are nuances. The author is in a position where he's trying to balance his relationship with his friend. But the friend's approach of an ultimatum is not constructive. The key here is whether the author is complicit in the racism. Since he's actively working to address it, he's not necessarily in the wrong. The friend's reaction might be extreme and could be part of the problem. \n\nThe cultural context is also mentioned, with the author noting that in Eastern Europe, such attitudes might be more common. While cultural context can explain some behavior, it doesn't excuse racism. The author is trying to navigate this without condemning his partner entirely, which is a valid approach.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is not in the wrong because he's making an effort to address the racism and isn't supporting it. The friend's ultimatum is the real issue here. So the answer should be B for No.\n"
