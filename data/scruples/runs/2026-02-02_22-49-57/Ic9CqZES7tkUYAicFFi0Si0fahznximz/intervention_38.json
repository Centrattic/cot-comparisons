She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking whether they're at fault for dating a girl who's racist. The girlfriend is from Ukraine, and her racism is against Black people. The main conflict is that a close Black friend is upset and giving an ultimatum. The user is trying to balance their feelings for their girlfriend with their friend's feelings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Racism is a serious issue. The user mentions that the girlfriend's racism might be cultural, but that doesn't excuse it. However, the user is trying to address the problem by encouraging their girlfriend to change her behavior. That's a positive step, but how effective is that? Changing someone's racist views isn't easy, and it's not the user's responsibility to fix their partner's racism. It's possible the user is in denial or minimizing the issue.\n\nNext, the friend's reaction. The friend is a Black person who's been close for three years. The ultimatum \"bros before hoes\" is problematic because it reduces the issue to a simple choice, which isn't fair. However, the friend is justified in feeling hurt and betrayed. If the user continues the relationship despite knowing the girlfriend's racist views, they might be enabling that behavior, even if they're not the racist person themselves.\n\nThe user's perspective is that they're not at fault because the racism might be cultural and they're trying to help. But the key question is whether it's wrong to be in a relationship with someone who's racist. Even if it's cultural, staying with them could perpetuate the problem. The user should consider whether they can truly support their friend while being in a relationship with a racist partner. The friend's feelings and the impact on their friendship are significant here.\n\nAnother angle: the user is not the one being racist, but by staying with the girlfriend, they might be complicit. The friend's ultimatum is extreme, but his hurt is valid. The user might be in a difficult position, but they need to weigh their values. Is supporting the girlfriend's change worth losing a close friend? The user's attempts to address the issue are good, but if those efforts aren't working, maybe they should reevaluate the relationship's future.\n\nIn conclusion, the user isn't necessarily at fault for dating someone with racist views, but they might be enabling that behavior by staying in the relationship. The real issue is whether they're allowing the racism to continue without addressing it effectively. The friend's reaction is understandable, but the ultimatum is a heavy-handed approach. The user is in a tough spot, but the answer might hinge on whether they're actively working to change the situation or just accepting it.\n"
