She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The situation is described as the girlfriend being racist towards Black people, which the author is trying to address.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend's racism is a problem for the author's friend, especially since one of them is Black. The friend is giving an ultimatum, which is causing conflict. The author is trying to handle it by working on his girlfriend's views but is being pressured to choose between the relationship and the friendship.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. Dating someone with racist views isn't inherently wrong, but it's problematic if those views are causing harm or discomfort to others close to you. The author seems to be aware of the issue and is making an effort to address it, which is a positive step. However, the girlfriend's racism is offensive and harmful, and the author is in a position where he's being asked to choose between supporting his friend or staying with his girlfriend.\n\nThe key factors here are the impact of the girlfriend's racism on others and the author's responsibility in the relationship. Even if the racism is culturally ingrained, it's the individual's choice to hold such views. The author might be enabling the behavior by staying in the relationship without confronting it more directly. The ultimatum from the friend is harsh, but the author's choice to prioritize the relationship over the friend's feelings could be seen as inconsiderate, especially since the friend is directly affected by the racism.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to change the situation and isn't fully committing to the girlfriend's views. However, by continuing the relationship despite knowing her racism, he might be complicit in it, even if unintentionally. The fact that the girlfriend's racism is hurtful to his close friends, particularly his Black friend, adds another layer of ethical consideration. The author needs to consider whether he can effectively address her racism or if it's better to end the relationship to avoid supporting harmful attitudes.\n\nIn terms of the options, A is the author is in the wrong, B isn't. The decision hinges on whether supporting a racist partner is wrong. Since racism is a serious issue, and the author is aware of it, choosing to stay in the relationship despite the negative impact on others could be seen as complicity. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A. But there's also the nuance that the author is trying to help, which complicates things. However, the ultimatum from the friend is a consequence of the author's choice, which might not make him entirely at fault. Hmm, tricky. Maybe B isn't right either. Wait, the question is if the author is in the wrong. If he's aware of her racism and chooses to stay with her despite knowing it's hurtful to his friend, then he might be in the wrong. But if he's actively working on it, maybe not. The answer isn't straightforward. The author might not be in the wrong for dating her, but he's in a difficult position. The core issue is whether he's complicit in her racism. Since the friend is directly affected and the author is prioritizing the girlfriend, that could be seen as wrong. So maybe A is correct.\n"
