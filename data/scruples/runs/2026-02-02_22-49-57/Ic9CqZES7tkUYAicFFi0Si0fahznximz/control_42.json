She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The situation involves the author's girlfriend, Diana, who is described as racist against Black people. The author is trying to change her views but faces an ultimatum from a close Black friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend's racism is a problem, and the author is aware of it. The author is trying to address it, which shows some effort. However, the friend's ultimatum adds pressure. The question is whether the author is wrong for continuing the relationship despite the racism.\n\nRacism is a serious issue. Even if it's a cultural background as the author suggests, it's important to recognize that holding racist views is unacceptable. The author is in a position where they are supporting someone who expresses prejudice, which can harm others. The fact that the friend feels betrayed and is cutting ties because of this is significant. The author is making a choice that affects not just the girlfriend but also their friendship, which has been a long-standing relationship.\n\nHowever, the author might argue that they're trying to change her views, and it's a complex issue. But changing someone's racist beliefs is challenging and not entirely the responsibility of the partner. The author's friend is within his rights to set a boundary, especially since the racist comments are directed at his culture. The ultimatum, while harsh, reflects the seriousness of the issue from his perspective.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might feel they're not in the wrong because they're trying to address the problem. But the presence of racism in a relationship can be a deal-breaker for many, especially when it affects others close to the person. The author needs to consider whether they can accept and support someone who holds such views, even if they're working on it.\n\nIn terms of ethics, enabling or being in a relationship with someone who is racist can be seen as problematic. The author is in a position where they have to weigh their happiness against the well-being of their friend and the broader implications of supporting racism. The friend's reaction is a valid response to being targeted by the girlfriend's racism, even if indirectly.\n\nSo, considering all these factors, the author might be in the wrong because they are choosing to stay in a relationship that perpetuates racism, despite the friend's objections. The effort to change the girlfriend's views is commendable, but it's not enough to justify the ongoing harm caused by her racist statements. The author's decision to prioritize the relationship over the friend's well-being could be seen as supporting the racist behavior, which is ethically questionable.\n"
