She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for dating a racist Ukrainian girl. The author mentions that Diana is racist against Black people and that one of his friends, who is Black, is upset and giving an ultimatum. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The author is in a new relationship and really likes Diana. They're trying to help her not be racist by asking her not to make those comments around his friends and family. The friend is angry and saying \"bros before hoes,\" which is a problematic statement in itself. The only specific example given is Diana saying she doesn't like Black people much and wouldn't want to go to Africa. The author is caught between his girlfriend and a close friend, and is trying to resolve it without making a choice yet.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. In the AITA context, usually the focus is on the person's actions and whether they were reasonable. The author isn't condoning racism; they're actively trying to address it. They're also not forcing the friend to accept Diana, but the friend is making a harsh ultimatum. The author's approach seems mature\u2014they're trying to communicate with both the friend and the girlfriend. \n\nBut is it the author's fault? Well, the friend is being unreasonable by giving an ultimatum. The author is not the one who is racist, so they can't be blamed for that. However, the author should be aware that dating someone with such views might affect their relationships. The key here is that the author is making an effort to mitigate the problem, which is the right approach. The friend overstepping by dictating the author's choices is the real issue. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The friend is the one acting unreasonably by demanding a choice. The author's responsibility is to handle the racism in their relationship, which they're doing by trying to get the girlfriend to change her behavior. The friend shouldn't be the one to make that decision for the author. The author isn't wrong for choosing a partner who may have problematic views if they're working to address it, especially in a new relationship. The friend's ultimatum is the problem here.\n"
