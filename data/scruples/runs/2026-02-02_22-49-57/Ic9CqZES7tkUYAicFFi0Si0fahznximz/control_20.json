She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The scenario involves cultural differences, personal relationships, and the pressure from a friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author likes the girl a lot and is happy with her. The racism is described as cultural, possibly from Eastern Europe. The girlfriend's racism isn't extreme\u2014just disliking Black people and not wanting to go to Africa. The friend, who is Black, feels betrayed and gives an ultimatum: girlfriend or friendship. The author is conflicted but doesn't want to choose between them.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, supporting racism is definitely wrong. But the author isn't a racist; he's trying to help his girlfriend change. The girlfriend's behavior might be a byproduct of her upbringing or environment. The author is in a difficult position, trying to navigate a relationship while respecting his friend's feelings.\n\nHowever, the friend's ultimatum is problematic. \"Bros before hoes\" is a phrase that devalues relationships and can be dismissive of the author's feelings. The friend is imposing his values on the author's personal life. While the friend has a right to be upset, the ultimatum is extreme and might not be fair. The author isn't advocating for racism; he's trying to address it.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's racism is a serious issue. Even if it's cultural, it's harmful. The author might be enabling her by not confronting her enough. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. He's making an effort to change her views, which is commendable, but if she's unwilling to change, that's a red flag.\n\nIn relationships, both parties should respect each other's values. If the author can't get his girlfriend to change her views, continuing the relationship might perpetuate racism. However, the author isn't the one being racist; he's the one trying to address it. The friend's reaction is valid in part because racism is a serious issue, but the ultimatum is harsh.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's in a tough spot, trying to balance his feelings for his girlfriend and his friendship. The friend's response is extreme, and the girlfriend's racism is a problem, but the author is making efforts to address it. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but with the caveat that he needs to consider the long-term implications of staying in a relationship with someone who holds racist views.\n"
