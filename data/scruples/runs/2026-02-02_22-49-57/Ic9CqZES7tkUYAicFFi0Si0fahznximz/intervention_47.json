She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking about a situation where they're dating a Ukrainian girl who's a bit racist, specifically against Black people. They mention that in Eastern Europe, maybe it's more common, and they're trying to get her to not express that racism around friends and family. The friend who's Black is upset and giving an ultimatum: break up with the girlfriend or lose the friendship.\n\nFirst, the author's perspective: they really like their girlfriend and don't want to stop seeing her. They think racism is a cultural issue there and that changing someone's views is hard, which they've done before. They're making efforts to get her to stop being racist in front of others. But the friend feels betrayed and is pressuring them to choose.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider a few angles. If the girlfriend is genuinely racist and the author is aware of it, is it ethical to continue the relationship? On the other hand, the friend is taking a moral stance, which is understandable given the personal experience of racism. \n\nThe author's actions: they're trying to address the racism, which shows they're not okay with it. They're not just ignoring it but are working on it. The girlfriend's specific behavior includes not liking Black people and not wanting to go to Africa. The author is trying to mediate between the girlfriend and their friend. \n\nBut the friend is using a \"bros before hoes\" argument, which is a problematic phrase in itself as it devalues relationships. However, the core issue is whether the author is complicit in racism by continuing to date someone who makes racist comments. \n\nThe key points here are that the author is making an effort to change the behavior, the racism is a cultural issue, and the friend is upset. The author's responsibility isn't necessarily to \"cure\" the girlfriend of racism, but to respect their friend's boundaries. If the friend is uncomfortable and the girlfriend's racism is causing direct harm to their friendship, the author might need to consider that. However, the friend's ultimatum is also an overreach, as they're not the sole arbiter of the author's values. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a complex situation. The author isn't in the wrong because they're making efforts to address the issue, but they might be in a situation where they need to set boundaries. The friend's approach is confrontational, but the presence of racism in the relationship is a valid concern. The author is navigating between two important relationships and trying to do the right thing. So, the answer might be B, but with some nuances.\n"
