She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating a racist Ukrainian girl. So first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author is dating Diana, who has racist views against Black people. He mentions that in Eastern Europe, there might be more cultural acceptance of such attitudes, but he's trying to get her to change her behavior, especially around his friends and family. His black friend is upset and gave an ultimatum: break up with Diana or lose the friendship. The author is conflicted because he likes Diana a lot but doesn't want to lose his friend either.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. Dating someone with racist views isn't inherently wrong, but the issue here is that the author is aware of her racism and hasn't addressed it. He's trying to get her to stop being racist, which is a good step, but maybe he hasn't done enough. The friend's reaction is strong, but the friend is also making an ultimatum, which could be problematic.\n\nIs the author responsible for Diana's racism? Not directly; he can't control her beliefs. However, by being in a relationship with her, he might be supporting someone who holds harmful views. The author's responsibility is to challenge those views, which he's attempting. But if he continues the relationship despite knowing her racism, some might argue he's complicit, especially if he's not actively working to change her views or if he's okay with her expressing them in public.\n\nThe friend's argument is that the author is betraying him by dating a racist. The author might feel torn between his loyalty to his friend and his partner. However, the friend's ultimatum using \"bros before hoes\" is a toxic approach and doesn't encourage open dialogue. The author's choice to stay with Diana isn't necessarily wrong, but he might need to consider the consequences, like losing friends who value inclusivity.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to address the issue, which shows he's not ignoring the problem. But if Diana's racism is a deal-breaker for his friends and family, there's a conflict between his personal happiness and maintaining those relationships. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for choosing his partner over his friend, but the friend's approach is also problematic.\n\nIn summary, the author isn't entirely wrong because he's making an effort to address the issue, but he might be in a difficult situation where the friend's reaction is overly harsh. The key points are whether the author is complicit in Diana's racism and if the friend's ultimatum is justified. The answer hinges on the balance between personal choice and social responsibility.\n"
