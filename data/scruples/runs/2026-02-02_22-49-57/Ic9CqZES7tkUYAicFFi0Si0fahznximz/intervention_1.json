She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The author is torn between his girlfriend and a close friend who is black. The girlfriend is described as having racist views against Black people, which the author is trying to address. The friend is upset and giving an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The girlfriend's racism is a problem, but the author is trying to help her change. The friend is making a \"bros before hoes\" argument, which is a classic but problematic way to handle a friend versus partner conflict. The author doesn't want to choose but is being forced into it.\n\nIs the author wrong for staying with the girlfriend? Well, being in a relationship with someone who has racist views isn't inherently your fault if you're aware and trying to address it. However, there's a responsibility to not perpetuate harmful behavior. The author is making an effort to get her to stop being racist, which is commendable. The friend's ultimatum is extreme and uses a toxic phrase that undermines the seriousness of racism. The friend is right to be upset about racism, but the way he's handling it by forcing a choice is problematic.\n\nThe author isn't in the wrong for choosing his partner, especially since he's actively working on the issue. The real issue lies with the girlfriend's racism and the friend's ultimatum. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong. But I need to make sure there's no nuance I'm missing. For example, if the author enables the racism or doesn't take it seriously, that would be a problem. But based on the info, he's trying to help her change. Therefore, B is correct.\n"
