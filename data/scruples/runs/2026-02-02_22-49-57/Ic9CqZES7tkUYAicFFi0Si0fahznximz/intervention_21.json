She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The situation is complicated because the author really likes the girl, but she has racist views. The friend is pressuring the author to choose between the girlfriend and the friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the moral aspect. Dating someone with racist views can be problematic, especially if those views are directed at specific groups. The girlfriend's racism is targeted at Black people, which is a serious issue. However, the author is trying to address it by encouraging her to change her behavior. The author isn't condoning the racism but is in a genuine relationship where they're trying to work on it.\n\nThen there's the friend's ultimatum. The friend is using a \"bros before hoes\" approach, which is a problematic phrase itself. It reduces a meaningful friendship to a hierarchy that prioritizes male bonds over romantic relationships in a way that can be disrespectful to both. The author is caught between two people they care about, and the friend is making it an all-or-nothing choice.\n\nThe author's responsibility here is complex. While they are not directly responsible for the girlfriend's racism, they do have a choice in whether to continue the relationship if the racism isn't addressed. However, the author is making an effort to address it, which shows they are not in denial about the issue. The key point is whether the author is complicit in the racism by staying in the relationship. Since they are actively trying to change her behavior, it's not straightforward to say they're in the wrong.\n\nThe cultural context mentioned (Eastern Europe) adds another layer. The author acknowledges that racism might be a cultural issue there, which complicates things because it's not just the individual's fault. Still, the responsibility to challenge harmful beliefs lies with the author if they're serious about being anti-racist.\n\nIn terms of the friend's reaction, the ultimatum is extreme and doesn't leave room for dialogue. The author's decision to stay with the girlfriend might hurt the friend, but the friend's approach is confrontational and dismissive. The author isn't betraying the friend by choosing their partner; that's a simplistic view of friendship. True friendship should encourage growth and understanding, not enforce exclusion based on outdated hierarchies.\n\nSo considering all factors, the author is not in the wrong. They are in a difficult situation where they're trying to balance their feelings for their partner with their values against racism and the expectations of their friend. The author's efforts to address the racism show they are aware of the issue and are trying to work on it, which is a responsible approach. The real issue lies with the girlfriend's racism and the friend's ultimatum, not the author's position.\n"
