She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking whether the person who wrote about dating a racist girlfriend is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The guy is dating a Ukrainian girl named Diana for a week. He really likes her and she seems great in other ways. But she's racist against Black people. He's in Europe, so maybe the cultural context is different. He mentions that his father had similar experiences in Russia, so he's attributing her racism to cultural factors. He's trying to get her to stop being racist, especially in front of his friends and family. His black friend is upset and giving him an ultimatum: stop dating Diana or lose the friendship. The guy is conflicted but doesn't want to choose between them.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's wrong for sticking with his girlfriend. Let's break it down. Dating someone who holds racist views can be problematic because it supports and condones those views. Even if the racism is culturally influenced, the person is still expressing hate or prejudice. The friend's reaction is strong, but maybe valid because he's the one being targeted. The author is trying to address the issue, which is good, but if the racism isn't changing, is it okay to stay with her? There's a difference between someone being intolerant in a different culture and actively harming others. The girlfriend's specific actions\u2014disliking Black people and not wanting to go to Africa\u2014might seem minor, but they still contribute to a harmful ideology. The author might be enabling her racism by not ending the relationship. On the other hand, he's trying to change her views, which is commendable, but maybe not enough. The friend's ultimatum is harsh, but he has the right to be upset. The author is caught between two people. \n\nIs he wrong for choosing his girlfriend over his friend? Well, if he's aware of her racism and chooses not to end the relationship despite the friend's valid concerns, he might be complicit. But if the racism is not overtly harmful beyond her opinions, maybe it's a personal choice. However, racism is a serious issue, and supporting someone with those views can be seen as wrong. The answer might depend on whether the author is actively trying to address it. He is, but if that's not enough, then maybe he is in the wrong. The key points are that racism is harmful, and supporting someone who has those views can be problematic, even if it's culturally influenced. The friend's anger is justified because being racist is harmful, and the author might be enabling that by staying with her. So, the answer is likely A, he's in the wrong.\n"
