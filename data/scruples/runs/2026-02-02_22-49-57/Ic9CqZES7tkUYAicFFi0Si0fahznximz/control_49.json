She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The person is conflicted between their girlfriend, Diana, who has racist views against Black people, and their best friend who is Black and is upset about the relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The author is in a week-long relationship and really likes Diana, but she's racist. They\u2019re trying to change her views, but she hasn't changed. The friend, who is Black, is giving an ultimatum: break up with Diana or lose the friendship. The author is trying to navigate both relationships but is stuck.\n\nNow, the key points here are about the girlfriend's racism. The author mentions that it's a cultural issue in Eastern Europe, which might explain her views. However, just because something is culturally common doesn't excuse it. Racism is a serious issue, and supporting someone who holds racist beliefs can be harmful, especially if they act on those beliefs.\n\nThe author is trying to make Diana stop being racist, but if she's not changing, then continuing the relationship could be problematic. The best friend's reaction, while harsh with the ultimatum, is also a valid response to being targeted by a racist partner. The phrase \"bros before hoes\" is a problematic way to handle it, but the underlying issue is valid\u2014supporting a racist partner can hurt those who are the target of that racism.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for staying with Diana. The author is defending their choice to stay, but by continuing to date someone who is racist, they might be enabling that behavior. Even if the racism is cultural, it's important to stand against it. The author's attempt to change Diana's views is commendable, but if she's not changing, the relationship could be harmful to others and perpetuate racism.\n\nSo, the author is in a tough spot, but by staying with Diana despite her racism, they might be in the wrong. Supporting a partner's racist views, even if they're cultural, can be seen as complicit. The best friend's reaction is extreme, but the author needs to consider the impact of their choice on others. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because they're enabling racism, even if it's unintentional.\n"
