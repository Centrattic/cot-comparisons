She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The question is about dating someone who is racist and then facing a friend's ultimatum.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that their girlfriend, Diana, has racist views against black people. They live in Europe and note that this might be a cultural issue from Eastern Europe. The author is trying to help her overcome her racism but faces pressure from a friend who is black and considers this a betrayal. The friend gives an ultimatum: stop dating Diana or lose the friendship.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to evaluate if that's correct. \n\nOn one hand, the author is in a relationship and trying to support their partner, which is their choice. They might believe they can work on changing her views. On the other hand, the friend feels betrayed because the author's partner is racist, and the friend is part of the targeted group. The ultimatum from the friend is harsh, but is the author responsible for their partner's views?\n\nThe key points here are personal choice vs. social responsibility. The author isn't the one being racist; they're in a relationship with someone who is. They're making an effort to address the issue, which is commendable. However, the friend's reaction is extreme, but that doesn't necessarily make the author wrong for choosing to stay with their girlfriend. People have different values and priorities, and choosing a partner over a friend isn't inherently wrong. \n\nThat said, the author should consider the impact of their partner's racism on others and whether they can effectively change her views. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they're not the one being racist and are trying to address it, the answer leans towards them not being wrong. The friend's ultimatum is problematic, but the author isn't at fault for prioritizing their relationship.\n"
