She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about dating a girl who's racist, specifically against Black people, and facing an ultimatum from a friend.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The guy is in a new relationship with a Ukrainian girl named Diana. He really likes her, but she's \"kind of racist,\" especially towards Black people. He's trying to get her to stop being racist around his friends and family. His friend, who is Black, is upset and giving him an ultimatum: choose between the girlfriend or the friend. The guy is conflicted and doesn't want to choose.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nRacism is a serious issue, and tolerating it can be problematic. The guy's friend is a victim of the racism, so the friend's feelings are valid. The guy is trying to address the issue, but maybe not effectively. However, the girlfriend's background in Eastern Europe might contribute to her views, as the user mentions cultural factors and past experiences from his dad's work trips. But that doesn't excuse racism.\n\nThe guy is caught between two important relationships. His friend's ultimatum is harsh, but the friend is in a valid position because being subjected to racism is hurtful. The guy's stance is that he's not in the wrong because he's trying to change her, but that might not be enough. Tolerating someone's racism, even if you're trying to change them, can still be seen as complicit. \n\nOn the other hand, the guy is in a new relationship and might be giving her the benefit of the doubt. However, if the racism is affecting his friendships and causing harm, he might need to take a stand. The fact that his friend is Black and directly affected adds weight to the friend's perspective. The guy could be in the wrong for not addressing the racism more firmly or for not supporting his friend adequately. \n\nBut maybe the girlfriend hasn't done anything extreme\u2014just expressing dislike. However, even that is a form of racism. The friend's reaction is about being betrayed, but the guy is trying to handle it. It's a complex situation. The question is whether the guy is in the wrong for continuing the relationship despite knowing her racist views. If he's aware and doesn't act, he might be complicit. However, if he's actively trying to change her, maybe he's not entirely at fault. \n\nBut the ultimatum from the friend is extreme. The friend is trying to force the guy to take a side, which is tough. The guy might be in the wrong if he's prioritizing his girlfriend's comfort over his friend's well-being, but if he's making an effort, it's a middle ground. However, in such cases, supporting the victim is usually the correct stance. So the guy is in the wrong for staying with the girlfriend if her racism is causing direct harm to his friend. Therefore, the answer might be A. But I need to consider if the guy is in the wrong. If he's aware of the racism and doesn't take a stand, then yes. If he's trying to change her, maybe not. But the friend's position is valid. Hmm.\n\nI think the key here is that the guy is in the wrong because he's choosing to be in a relationship with someone who holds racist views, which directly affects his friend's life. Even if he's trying to change her, the fact that he's in the relationship and the racism is causing harm makes him complicit. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
