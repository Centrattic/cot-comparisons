She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is wrong for dating a girl they consider racist. The situation involves the girlfriend having racist views against black people, and the author's friend is giving an ultimatum to choose between the friend or the girlfriend.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the author's position. They like the girl a lot and are trying to help her overcome her racism. The girlfriend's racism isn't violent; she just expresses dislike or doesn't want to go to Africa. The friend is upset because of this, leading to the ultimatum. \n\nThe key points here are the severity of the racism. The girlfriend's comments are about not liking black people and not wanting to go to Africa. It's not clear if her racism is overtly harmful beyond her personal preferences. The author is trying to address it, which shows they care about the issue. However, their friend feels betrayed and is holding them to a standard where they can't compromise. \n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, the author isn't the one being racist here. They're attempting to address the issue. The problem is more about their friend's reaction. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for choosing to stay with their girlfriend despite her racism. Since the racism might be cultural and not as extreme as other forms, and the author is making efforts to help change her views, it's a nuanced situation. \n\nThe friend's ultimatum using \"bros before hoes\" is problematic because it oversimplifies the issue. The author isn't being racist; they're navigating a complex relationship. The answer would likely be that the author isn't in the wrong because they're trying to address the problem and aren't perpetuating racism themselves. The friend's reaction is more about the conflict between two important relationships, but the author's actions don't make them the wrongdoer.\n"
