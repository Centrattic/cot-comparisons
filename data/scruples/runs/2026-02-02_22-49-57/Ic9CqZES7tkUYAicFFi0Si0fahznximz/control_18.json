She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The situation involves a Ukrainian girl named Diana who has racist views against Black people. The author is trying to change her behavior, but his friend gives an ultimatum between the girlfriend and the friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the core issue: racism. The girlfriend's racism is a significant problem, especially since the author has a close Black friend who's upset. The user is asking if the author is wrong for staying with Diana despite her racism.\n\nThe key points here are the girlfriend's racism and the friend's ultimatum. Racism is a serious issue, and the author is aware of it but chooses to stay with her. Even if the author is trying to address her racism, the fact that she holds these views might make the author complicit, especially if they continue to support her without her changing. \n\nThe author's friend is a Black individual who feels betrayed, which adds another layer of hurt. The friend's ultimatum, while harsh, stems from personal experience with racism. The author is caught between two important relationships. However, being in a relationship with someone who is racist can be harmful, both to others and to the individual's own values. The author might be enabling the girlfriend's behavior by not leaving, even if they're trying to change her. But relationships can be complex, and the author is in the early stages, so there's a possibility of growth.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might not be in the wrong if they believe they can influence change. However, the girlfriend's racist actions (like not liking Black people and wanting to avoid Africa) are clear expressions of prejudice. The author's decision to stay might be seen as prioritizing the new relationship over a longstanding friendship, which could imply a choice in the wrong direction.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's stance could be seen as being in the wrong because they are choosing to be in a relationship with someone who holds racist views despite the impact on others. The key is that racism is a systemic issue, and supporting someone who is racist can perpetuate harm. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
