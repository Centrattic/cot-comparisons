She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about dating someone who's racist, specifically against Black people. The author is trying to balance their feelings for their girlfriend and their friendship with a Black friend who's upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider racism's impact. Racism is a serious issue, and supporting or enabling it can hurt others. The girlfriend's racism, even if she's unaware of it, is harmful. The author is aware of this but is choosing to stay in a relationship with her. That might be a problem because it could validate her views or make the author complicit in some way.\n\nThe author's friend is upset and giving an ultimatum. The friend is a Black person who's directly affected by the girlfriend's racism. The friend's reaction is understandable; he feels betrayed because his friend is with someone who has racist views. The phrase \"bros before hoes\" is a bit problematic because it reduces the friendship to a hierarchy where the friend's loyalty is more important than the relationship. However, the core issue is the racism.\n\nThe author is trying to change the girlfriend's views, which is good, but it's not their responsibility to fix someone else's racism. Racism is systemic and personal; it's not just about individual actions. If the girlfriend continues to hold racist views and expresses them, the author might be supporting someone who has harmful beliefs.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might be in a tough spot. They genuinely like their girlfriend and are trying to work on the issue. But relationships should ideally support mutual respect for all people. If the girlfriend's racism isn't addressed, it could cause ongoing harm, not just to the friend but to others as well.\n\nThe author's decision to stay with the girlfriend while the friend is hurt suggests that the author might be prioritizing their romantic relationship over their friend's feelings and the broader issue of racism. That could be seen as being in the wrong because it's important to stand against racism, even if it's a cultural norm in some places.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author is in the wrong for staying with a racist partner despite knowing the harm it causes to others.\n"
