She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author is dating a Ukrainian girl named Diana. He really likes her and has been happy. However, she's racist against Black people. He mentions that this might be a cultural issue, common in Eastern Europe. He's trying to help her not express racism around his friends and family. One of his best friends, who is Black, is upset and giving him an ultimatum: choose between the girlfriend or the friend. The author is trying to find a middle ground but is being pressured.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks he's not, but wants my opinion. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no).\n\nLet me consider the key points. The girlfriend is racist, which the author is aware of. He's trying to address it, but she hasn't changed. The friend is feeling betrayed and is making a harsh choice. The author isn't forcing the friend to leave; it's the friend's own ultimatum. The author's actions seem to be trying to respect both his girlfriend and his friend, but he's in a tough spot.\n\nIs it the author's fault that his girlfriend has racist views? Probably not. People can't control others' backgrounds or inherent biases, though they can work on changing them. However, the author is choosing to be in a relationship with someone who expresses racism. That could be seen as supporting her views, but he's actively trying to correct that behavior. The friend's ultimatum is a problem, but the author isn't the one who created the racism. \n\nBut there's a nuance. By dating someone with racist views, even if he's trying to help her, he might be enabling her by not setting clearer boundaries. However, the question is about whether he's in the wrong. The friend's reaction is extreme, using \"bros before hoes,\" which is a dated and problematic phrase. The author is caught in a conflict between two important relationships. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. He's in a difficult situation, trying to navigate between his feelings for his girlfriend and his friendship. The real issue is the girlfriend's racism and the friend's harsh ultimatum. The author's actions don't indicate that he's supporting racism; he's actually trying to address it. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
