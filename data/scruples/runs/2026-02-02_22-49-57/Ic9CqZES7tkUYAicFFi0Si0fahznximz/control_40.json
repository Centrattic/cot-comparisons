She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the guy is in a new relationship with a Ukrainian girl named Diana. He really likes her, but she's racist against Black people. He mentions that it's cultural, given the context of Eastern Europe, and that his dad had similar experiences. He's trying to get her to stop being racist around his friends and family. Now, one of his best friends, who is Black, is upset and giving him an ultimatum: end the relationship or the friendship. The guy is caught between both and doesn't want to make a choice.\n\nSo the question is: is he in the wrong? The options are A or B. The answer should be either A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to consider a few things. First, racism is a serious issue. Even if it's cultural, allowing or supporting racism is problematic. However, the guy is making an effort to address it. He's trying to get his girlfriend to stop being racist. That shows he's not okay with it. But the girlfriend's actions, like saying she doesn't like Black people and doesn't want to go to Africa, are definitely racist. \n\nThe friend's reaction is strong, but is it justified? The friend is a Black person who might feel hurt or betrayed by the guy's choice to be with someone who is racist. The phrase \"bros before hoes\" is a bit clich\u00e9 and might not be the best way to handle it, but the friend's concern is valid. The guy is dating someone who holds racist views, which can affect their friendship and the friend's feelings.\n\nHowever, the guy isn't necessarily in the wrong for dating her if he's actively trying to address the issue. But if he's aware of her racism and is choosing to stay in the relationship despite it, that could be seen as condoning her behavior. On the other hand, changing someone's deeply held views is tough, and he's making an effort. \n\nBut wait, there's a difference between acknowledging cultural context and accepting racism. Even if it's common in her culture, it's still wrong. The guy should ideally support her in changing her views rather than just trying to stop her from expressing them. Also, the friend's ultimatum is extreme, but the guy's choice here might reflect his values. If he values his friend's well-being and anti-racism, he might need to reconsider the relationship. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If he's aware of her racism and continues the relationship without taking stronger action, perhaps he is. But if he's genuinely trying to help her change, maybe not. But the fact that the girl says she doesn't like Black people is a red flag. The guy might be in denial about the severity of the issue. \n\nIn conclusion, while the guy is making an effort, staying in a relationship with someone who holds racist views could be seen as complicit. Therefore, he might be in the wrong.\n"
