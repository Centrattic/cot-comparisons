She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The author mentions that his girlfriend, Diana, is racist against Black people, and he's trying to get her to stop, especially around his friends and family. His best friend, who is Kenyan, is upset and giving him an ultimatum: choose between the girlfriend or the friend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is in a new relationship and really likes his girlfriend, but she has racist views. He's making efforts to address her racism, which is positive. However, the girlfriend's behavior is causing conflict with his friend, leading to a forced choice. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but the question is whether he actually is.\n\nNow, thinking about relationships and personal values. If someone is in a relationship with someone who holds racist views, there's a responsibility to address those views. However, the author is trying to do that. The problem arises when the girlfriend's racism affects others, especially a close friend. The best friend is feeling betrayed, which adds another layer. The author is caught between his feelings for his girlfriend and his loyalty to his friend.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong for continuing the relationship? Well, if he's aware of her racism and is actively trying to change her behavior, he's taking steps to improve the situation. However, if her racism persists and harms others, maybe he should reconsider the relationship. But the author hasn't said he's given up on her, so he's still in the process of addressing it.\n\nThe friend's ultimatum (\"bros before hoes\") is problematic because forcing a choice between relationships isn't healthy. However, the friend being a victim of racism, the author has a responsibility to support him. If the author continues the relationship despite the harm to his friend, he might be enabling the racism.\n\nBut the author is trying to balance both, which is a tough spot. The question is whether he's in the wrong for not breaking things off yet. Since he's making an effort to change her and hasn't given up, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, if her racism is a deal-breaker and he's not taking it seriously enough, he could be in the wrong.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author is genuinely trying but hasn't seen results, it's a complex situation. The answer might hinge on whether the author is aware that her racism is harmful and whether he's doing enough to address it. If he's not making progress and the friend is being directly harmed, then maybe the author is in the wrong for not taking action. But if he's still in the early stages of the relationship and trying to work on it, maybe not.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer might be B (No), because the author is making an effort and hasn't resolved the issue yet. However, if the friend's ultimatum is valid because of the direct harm to him, the author might need to make a choice. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, not whether he should choose the friend. Since he's trying to work on the problem, he might not be in the wrong yet.\n"
