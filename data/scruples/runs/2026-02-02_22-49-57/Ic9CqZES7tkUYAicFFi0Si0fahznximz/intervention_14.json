She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking about whether dating a racist girl makes them the \"asshole.\" The situation is that the author is in a new relationship with Diana, who has racist views, particularly against black people. The author is trying to help her change her views but is facing pressure from a friend who is black and is threatening an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author mentions that the racism might be cultural, given that they're in Eastern Europe and the friend's dad had similar experiences. The author is making an effort to address the racism, but Diana's comments are still causing issues with the friend. The friend is giving an ultimatum, which the author finds harsh.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong for continuing the relationship. On one hand, supporting a friend who is being targeted by racism is important. The friend's feelings are valid, and standing by someone who is racist might be seen as complicit. On the other hand, the author is trying to help their girlfriend change, which shows they're not endorsing the racism but trying to work through it.\n\nBut here's the thing: racism is a serious issue, and while cultural factors might contribute, it's not an excuse. The author is aware of the problem and is trying to address it, which is a good step. However, if the girlfriend is making deliberate racist comments in front of others, even if it's not the author's intention, it's affecting their friend's well-being. The author is caught between two people they care about. \n\nThe friend's ultimatum is extreme, but the author's responsibility to their friend shouldn't be ignored. The user might argue that the author isn't the one being racist, but by staying with the girlfriend, they might be enabling the behavior. However, if the author is actively trying to change that, maybe they're not in the wrong. But there's a balance between supporting a partner's growth and protecting a friend from harm. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author is aware that their partner's racism is causing harm to their friend and if they're doing enough to stop it. The author is making an effort, but if those efforts aren't working, they might still be complicit. However, the friend's response is also extreme, which complicates things. \n\nIn the end, the author is not in the wrong for trying to help their partner, but they do have a responsibility to their friend. However, the friend's ultimatum is the bigger issue. The author is in a tough spot, but they're not entirely at fault. So I think the answer is B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
