She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (who's dating a racist Ukrainian girl) is in the wrong. The situation involves the girlfriend's racism, specifically against Black people. The author is trying to address this, but his friend, who is Black, is upset and giving an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Racism is a serious issue, and supporting someone who holds racist views can be seen as complicit. However, the author is trying to help his girlfriend change, which shows he's aware of the problem. But the key point here is the ultimatum from his friend. The friend is saying that dating the racist girlfriend equals betrayal, leading to a choice between the relationship and the friendship.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for choosing to stay with his girlfriend despite her racism. On one hand, he's not a racist himself and is trying to address her views, which is commendable. On the other, by staying with her, he might be endorsing her behavior, even if unintentionally. The friend's reaction is about loyalty and values\u2014supporting a racist partner can hurt others, especially those targeted by the racism.\n\nThe author's actions could be seen as prioritizing his romantic relationship over his friend's feelings and values, which might make him wrong. However, the complexity lies in whether he's actively working to change her views. But the fact remains that he's in a relationship with someone who holds harmful beliefs, and that can have negative consequences, even if he's trying to change her. The friend's ultimatum is harsh, but the author's decision to stay with her could be seen as supporting her racism, which is wrong regardless of his intentions.\n\nTherefore, while the author has good intentions, he might be in the wrong by not taking a stronger stance against the racism, especially since it's affecting his friend directly. The friend's perspective is valid because the racism is impacting him personally, and the author's choice to remain in the relationship could be seen as a betrayal of their friendship and values.\n"
