She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the author is in a new relationship with a Ukrainian girl named Diana. They really like her and are happy. But there's an issue: Diana is a bit racist against black people. The author is in Europe, so the context might be different from the US, but the problem is still there. The author's friend, who is black, is upset and giving an ultimatum. The author is caught between their friend and girlfriend.\n\nThe key points here are the author's responsibility regarding their girlfriend's racism. They mention that they've tried to talk to their girlfriend about it, which shows they are aware of the issue and are trying to address it. The friend is making a harsh ultimatum, which adds pressure on the author. The question is whether the author is wrong for continuing the relationship.\n\nI need to consider if dating someone with racist views is inherently wrong. Racism is a serious problem, and supporting or enabling it is harmful. However, the author is making an effort to change their girlfriend's views. But is that enough? The friend's reaction is extreme, but the author might feel torn between loyalty to their friend and their relationship. \n\nOn one hand, the author isn't the one being racist; it's their girlfriend. But by being in a relationship with her, are they implicitly supporting her views? People can choose to be in relationships with others regardless of differences, but racism is a significant issue. The author's friend feels betrayed, which adds another layer of social consequences.\n\nI also need to think about cultural context. The author mentions that in Eastern Europe, there might be more ingrained racism. It's possible that Diana's views are part of her upbringing or environment. The author is trying to address it, which is commendable, but changing someone's racist beliefs is a long process. However, the author isn't the one with the racist views; they're trying to change them. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If they're actively working to counter their girlfriend's racism, maybe they aren't. But if they ignore or enable her behavior, that could be problematic. The friend's ultimatum is harsh, but it's their right to feel upset. The author is in a tough spot, but the key is whether they're complicit in the racism. Since they're trying to address it, maybe they aren't wrong. However, some might argue that you can't control someone else's views, and by being with her, they're associating with someone who holds harmful beliefs, which could be seen as wrong.\n\nI'm leaning towards the author not being in the wrong because they're taking steps to address the issue. But this is a nuanced situation where there's no clear right or wrong answer. The friend's reaction is extreme, but the author's intentions are to improve the situation. So, the answer might be B (No), but I need to make sure I didn't overlook anything. The main factors are the author's active attempts to change their girlfriend's views and the context of cultural influence. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
