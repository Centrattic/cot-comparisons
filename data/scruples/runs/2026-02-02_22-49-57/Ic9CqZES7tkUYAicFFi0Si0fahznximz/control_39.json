She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The situation is that the author is in a new relationship with a Ukrainian girl named Diana, who the author describes as racist against Black people. The author is trying to address this, but a close Black friend is upset and giving an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, the question is about whether the author is at fault. The options are A (yes) or B (no). Let me break this down.\n\nDiana's racism is a significant issue. Racism is a serious problem, and being in a relationship with someone who holds racist views can be problematic. The author is trying to change her behavior, which is commendable, but the friend is upset that the author hasn't ended the relationship. The friend is Black, so this is a personal issue for him.\n\nThe author is caught between two people: a girlfriend who's racist and a close friend who's feeling betrayed. The friend is giving an ultimatum, which adds pressure. Now, the key points here are:\n\n1. Is the author responsible for their partner's racism? Not directly, but being in a relationship with someone who is racist can be seen as complicit if you don't take action. However, the author is trying to address it, so that's a positive step.\n\n2. The friend's reaction is valid because he's being targeted by the girlfriend's racism. The phrase \"bros before hoes\" is problematic because it marginalizes the importance of the friend's feelings and the serious issue of racism. However, his stance is understandable given the situation.\n\n3. The author's responsibility here is complex. They might not be in the wrong if they're actively trying to change the situation. But if they're staying in the relationship despite knowing the girlfriend is racist and the friend is being harmed, some might argue they are enabling the racism.\n\n4. Cultural context is mentioned, with the author suggesting it's a cultural issue in Eastern Europe. However, racism is a personal choice regardless of cultural background. The author can't excuse the girlfriend's behavior based on cultural norms.\n\n5. The author's actions: They are trying to get their girlfriend to change, which is a good step. However, if the girlfriend doesn't change, the author's continued support might be seen as allowing the racism to persist.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is in a tough spot. They're trying to address the issue, but the decision to stay with the girlfriend while the friend is being hurt is a point of contention. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they're making an effort to change things, but the situation is causing harm to a friend, it's possible they are not entirely wrong, but also not entirely right. However, since the options are A or B, and the key is whether the author is wrong for dating the racist girl. The answer might lean towards A because staying in a relationship with a racist person can be seen as complicit, but maybe the author is trying to change that. Hmm. Alternatively, considering the friend's perspective, the author might not be in the wrong because they're trying to fix things. This is tricky. I think the answer is A because the author is in a relationship with a racist person, which can be harmful. But they are trying to change that. The friend's reaction is understandable, but the author's choice to stay might be in the wrong. Alternatively, maybe B because they're making an effort. I'm a bit torn. But the question is if they are in the wrong. If the author is not taking enough action, then maybe A. If they are trying, maybe B. The correct answer might be A because being in a relationship with a racist person is problematic, even if you're trying to change them. So the answer is A.\n"
