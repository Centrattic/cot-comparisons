She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for dating a girl they consider racist. The main points from the story are that the girlfriend, Diana, is racist against Black people, and the writer is being pressured by a friend, who is Black, to end the relationship or lose the friendship. The writer is trying to address Diana's racism but is facing an ultimatum.\n\nFirst, I need to assess if the author is in the wrong. Dating someone with prejudiced views can be problematic, but the author isn't the one being racist. They're trying to help their girlfriend change, which is a proactive step. However, the question is whether the author is at fault for choosing to stay with Diana despite her racism.\n\nOn one hand, the author might be enabling bad behavior by not leaving the relationship. But the story mentions that the racism might be cultural, and the author is making efforts to address it. The friend's ultimatum adds pressure, but the author is caught between two important relationships. The friend feels betrayed, which is a valid emotional response, but the author isn't the one being racist. \n\nThe key here is whether the author should be held responsible for dating someone with racist views. Some might argue that they should end the relationship to support their Black friend, but others might say it's the girlfriend's responsibility to change her views. The author isn't forcing the racism; they're trying to work on it. The friend's reaction is harsh with the ultimatum, which could be seen as extreme. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're not the racist one; they're trying to address the issue. The real problem lies with the girlfriend's racism and the friend's ultimatum. So the answer should be B.\n"
