She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The author is dating a Ukrainian girl named Diana. He likes her a lot and they've been together a week. The problem is her racism against Black people. He's in Europe, so maybe that's a different context than the US. His friend, who is Black, is upset and giving an ultimatum: break up with her or lose the friendship.\n\nThe author is trying to address the racism, which he thinks is cultural. He mentions his dad's experiences in Russia where there was racism. He's trying to get her to stop being racist so he can keep the friend. The friend says \"bros before hoes,\" which is a problematic phrase, implying that his Black friend values the friendship more than the girlfriend. The question is whether the author is wrong for sticking with his girlfriend despite her racism.\n\nHmm. So the user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants to know my take. Let me break it down. First, supporting racism is wrong, but the author isn't the one being racist. He's trying to address her behavior. The friend is using a harmful ultimatum, which is also a problem. The friend's approach is toxic because it frames the issue as the author choosing between his friend and girlfriend, rather than dealing with the underlying racism. Also, the phrase \"bros before hoes\" is a stereotype that devalues women, which is another red flag.\n\nThe author is in a tough spot. He's trying to balance his feelings for his new girlfriend with his friend's concerns. The main issue is whether it's wrong to date someone who is racist. If the author is not supporting the racism and is actively trying to address it, maybe he's not in the wrong. However, if he's enabling her racism by not confronting it, that's a different matter. But he's making an effort, as he said he's trying to get her to stop. The friend, on the other hand, is using an ultimatum without understanding the complexity of the situation.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong. He's dealing with a friend's overreaction and a culturally ingrained issue in his girlfriend. The friend's approach is more problematic. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
