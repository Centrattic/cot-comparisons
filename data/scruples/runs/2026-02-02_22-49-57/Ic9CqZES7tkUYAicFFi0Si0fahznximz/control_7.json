She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for dating a racist girlfriend. The situation involves the author's friend being upset because the girlfriend is racist against Black people, specifically a Kenyan friend. The friend is giving an ultimatum: choose between the girlfriend or the friendship.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend is described as having racist views, which the author is trying to change. The author is caught between his feelings for her and his friendship. The friend, who is Black, feels betrayed and is pressuring the author to end the relationship. The author is trying to navigate this without making a choice yet.\n\nNow, considering whether the author is in the wrong. The author's actions: he is in a relationship with someone who holds racist views. Even if it's a cultural issue, supporting someone with racism can be problematic. The author hasn't taken a firm stance against her views but is trying to change her. However, the friend is directly affected, as the girlfriend's racism could hurt him. The friend feels the author is betraying him by not ending the relationship, leading to the ultimatum.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, supporting someone's racist behavior is generally considered wrong. The author might be enabling the girlfriend's racism by staying in the relationship without addressing it more firmly. While the author isn't necessarily the one being racist, he's choosing to be in a relationship with someone who is, which can be seen as complicity. The friend's perspective is that the author is choosing the girlfriend over solidarity with him, which is a valid concern.\n\nOn the other hand, the author might not be directly responsible for his girlfriend's views, especially if they're cultural. He's making an effort to address it. However, the friend's ultimatum could be a reaction to feeling disrespected or invalidated. The author's decision to stay with the girlfriend despite her racism could be seen as prioritizing the relationship over an ally's feelings.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't the one being racist, but he is in a relationship with someone who is. The question is whether he is complicit. If he's not taking active steps to challenge her racism beyond asking her to stop, that might be part of the issue. The friend's ultimatum is extreme, but the author's choice to continue the relationship could be seen as not standing against racism, which might make him complicit to some extent.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be in the wrong for not taking a stronger stance against his girlfriend's racism, even if he's trying to change her. The friend's feelings are valid because racism affects people directly, and the author's choice could be seen as prioritizing the girlfriend over supporting his friend. Therefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
