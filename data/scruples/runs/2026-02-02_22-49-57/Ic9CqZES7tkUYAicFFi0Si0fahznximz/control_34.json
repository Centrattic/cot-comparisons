She's one of the most beautiful girls i've ever seen, she's smart, she's funny, sweet and just fun to be around. I've never been more happy in my life. However there is one problem, she's kind of racist. I live in Europe so its not much of a problem but she's kind of racist against black people. I think most people in eastern europe. My dad told me of stories of his work trips to russia and all the russians made threatening gestures to the black people in his group. Im guessing its kind of a cultural thing and curing racism isn't really simple cuz I've done it before. It's a long and erduos task to cure somebody of racism. I've been trying to get my girlfriend to not be racist or at least not say or do anything racist against black people in front of my friends and family. Some of my friends (one of whom is black and one of my best friends for the past 3 years) has been complaining i've been dating a racist. He says I'm betraying by dating her but I don't feel like i am. I don't want to make a choice between but he's making an ultimatum. I stop dating her or I stop being friends with him. He literally said \"bros before hoes\" and he says i have a few days to make my choice. I don't like getting this ultimatum and I'm trying calm him down and also get my gf to not be racist. As far as i know the only racist thing she did was say she doesn't like black people that much or would ever want to go to africa (he's kenyan btw). WIBTA if i stuck with my girlfriend on this?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for dating a racist girl. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The guy is dating a Ukrainian woman named Diana for a week. He really likes her and is happy with her. However, she's racist against Black people. He mentions that it might be cultural, referencing his dad's stories from Russia. He's trying to change her behavior, but his friend, who is Black, is upset and gave him an ultimatum: break up with her or lose the friendship.\n\nThe user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nSo, what are the key points here? The main issue is that the girlfriend is racist. The guy is in a new relationship and is trying to address her racism, but it's not clear if he's done enough. His friend, who is Black, feels betrayed and is making him choose between the relationship and the friendship. The guy doesn't want to make that choice and is trying to mediate.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, being racist is generally considered wrong. If someone is in a relationship with someone who holds racist views, especially if they express them openly, it's a problem. The boyfriend is trying to get her to change, but if she's not willing to change or if her racism persists, that could be a red flag. However, the duration of the relationship is only a week, so maybe he hasn't had enough time to address the issue effectively.\n\nThe friend's reaction is also important. The friend is a Black person who's been a close friend for three years. Feeling betrayed because his friend is dating a racist person is understandable. The ultimatum is harsh, but the friend's perspective is valid given the personal impact of racism. Bros before hoes is a problematic phrase, but the friend's stance highlights the seriousness of supporting someone who is racist.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If he continues the relationship despite knowing her racism, does that make him complicit or in the wrong? On the other hand, if he's trying to help her change, maybe he's not entirely in the wrong. However, supporting someone who holds racist views can be seen as enabling harmful attitudes, especially if those views are affecting others.\n\nBut the key here is that the girlfriend's racism is against Black people, and the friend is directly affected. The author is choosing to stay with someone who is prejudiced against one of his closest friends' identity. That seems problematic. Even if it's cultural, allowing that to continue in the relationship might be unjustifiable, especially if it's causing harm to others.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be in the wrong because he's maintaining a relationship with someone who holds racist views that directly affect a friend. The friend's reaction, while extreme, is a consequence of that decision. The author's choice to prioritize the new relationship over standing up against racism could be seen as supporting the racist behavior, hence making him in the wrong.\n"
