Afterwards she wouldn't talk to me the rest of the night.  I'm still pissed off, I can never catch a break.  I also had to pay for dinner, I assumed she was paying.  I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves replying to a sister's birthday message while out to dinner with his girlfriend. His girlfriend doesn't like him using his phone, and after he replies, she won't talk to him for the rest of the night. Also, he had to pay for dinner, expecting her to pay, but he had just emptied his savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\nFirst, the main issue is whether replying to his sister's message was wrong. The girlfriend's dislike of phone use during dinners is a prior established rule. The author broke that rule, leading to her silence. That's a point against him. Then there's the financial part: he assumed she would pay, but she didn't. Maybe he should have clarified who's paying beforehand. However, the sister asked if he wanted to go out for a birthday dinner, so maybe the expectation was mutual. But since he had financial issues, perhaps he should have communicated that better.\n\nBut the core question is about the phone use. The girlfriend's preference is clear, so by using his phone, he disregarded her feelings, which led to her being upset. The financial part might be a separate issue but contributes to the tension. So, the main fault is with the phone use. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
