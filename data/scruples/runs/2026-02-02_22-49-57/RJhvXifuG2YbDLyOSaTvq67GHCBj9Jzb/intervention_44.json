I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about replying to a sister's birthday message while out to eat with his girlfriend. The sister doesn't like him using his phone when they're out, and after he replied, she didn't talk to him the rest of the night. Also, he had to pay for dinner, which he thought she would cover, and he's upset because he just paid off a loan and emptied his savings and checking accounts.\n\nFirst, the main issue is using the phone during dinner. The girlfriend has expressed that she doesn't like this. Even if the message was from his sister, using the phone in her presence might have been disrespectful or hurt her feelings. Relationships often require compromise, especially when it comes to boundaries. If he knew beforehand that she didn't like phone use during meals, replying to the message might have breached that boundary. So, that's a point where he could be in the wrong.\n\nThen there's the financial aspect. He thought she would pay, but she ended up not contributing. Maybe there was a misunderstanding about splitting the bill. If he assumed she would pay, but she didn't, that could be her issue, but if he didn't clarify or check beforehand, that's on him. However, he mentions he had financial strain, which adds context. But still, not confirming the payment arrangement could be a misstep.\n\nThe sister's message was a birthday wish, which is understandable to respond to. However, the girlfriend's feelings about phone use during dinner are part of their relationship dynamics. The author might need to consider that even if the message was important, respecting her boundary is crucial for relationship health. His being upset about not getting a break and the financial part complicates things, but the primary issue is the phone use during dinner.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the key point is whether replying to the sister's message violated a clear boundary set by the girlfriend. If the girlfriend had communicated that she doesn't like phone use during meals, then the author should have respected that. Even if it was a birthday message, prioritizing the girlfriend's comfort in their shared time is important. The financial part is a separate issue but contributes to the overall tension. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for using the phone despite the girlfriend's preference.\n"
