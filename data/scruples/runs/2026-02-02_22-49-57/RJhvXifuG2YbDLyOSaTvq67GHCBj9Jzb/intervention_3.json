Afterwards she wouldn't talk to me the rest of the night.  I'm still pissed off, I can never catch a break.  I also had to pay for dinner, I assumed she was paying.  I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for replying to their sister's birthday message while they were out to eat with their girlfriend. The girlfriend doesn't like when he uses his phone during dinners. After replying, she didn't talk to him the rest of the night. Also, the author had to pay for dinner, thinking the girlfriend would cover it. He mentions he was broke from paying off a loan.\n\nFirst, the phone use: The girlfriend had already expressed disapproval of phone use during meals. So, replying to the sister's message might have been a breach of that mutual agreement or expectation. Even if it was a birthday message, using the phone could be seen as disrespectful in their context. The girlfriend's reaction of not talking for the rest of the night suggests that this was a significant issue for her.\n\nThen, the financial aspect: He thought she would pay, but she didn't. He was broke, so this could be a point of tension. However, assuming someone else will pay without clarifying could be a mistake. It's possible he should have communicated his financial situation before the dinner to avoid this outcome. But he did mention that the girlfriend initiated the dinner as a birthday dinner, which might imply she intended to cover the cost. However, without explicit confirmation, he might have misread the situation.\n\nPutting it all together: The main issue seems to be the phone use, which the girlfriend had previously communicated was a problem. The financial part is a secondary issue but still relevant. The author's frustration is understandable, especially financially, but if he agreed to the dinner knowing his financial state, maybe he should have discussed the payment beforehand. However, the girlfriend's not talking for the rest of the night is a strong reaction, which might indicate that the phone use was the bigger offense in her eyes.\n\nSo, considering both aspects, the author might be in the wrong for using the phone despite prior agreements. The financial part is more about miscommunication. Therefore, the answer leans towards A (Yes).\n"
