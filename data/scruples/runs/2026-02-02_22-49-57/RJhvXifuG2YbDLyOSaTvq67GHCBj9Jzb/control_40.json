Afterwards she wouldn't talk to me the rest of the night.  I'm still pissed off, I can never catch a break.  I also had to pay for dinner, I assumed she was paying.  I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for replying to their sister's birthday message while on a dinner date with their girlfriend. The girlfriend doesn't like phone use during meals. The author didn't talk to her the rest of the night, got mad, and also had to pay for dinner, which he thought she would cover. He mentions he's broke from paying off a loan.\n\nFirst, the main issue is the phone use. The girlfriend previously expressed dislike for him using his phone when they're out. Even though it's a birthday message, she might see it as disrespectful. The author's response led to her not speaking to him, which indicates a breach in their agreement or unspoken rule.\n\nThen there's the payment issue. If he assumed she would pay, but she expected him to, that's a problem. Miscommunication here could cause tension. He's upset because he's broke, but maybe he should have clarified who's paying beforehand. The fact that she asked if he wanted to go out for dinner might imply she expected him to pay, but he thought otherwise. \n\nPutting it all together, the author's actions in both using the phone and not clarifying payment responsibilities might be seen as inconsiderate. He didn't respect her boundaries about phone use, and he made an assumption about payment that caused another conflict. So, he's probably in the wrong here. The answer is A.\n"
