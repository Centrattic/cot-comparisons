      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation is that the author, who is 34 and male, went out to eat with his girlfriend (33, female). His sister messaged him \"Happy Birthday,\" and he replied. His girlfriend doesn't like him using his phone when they're out. After that, she didn't talk to him the rest of the night. The author is upset because he had to pay for dinner, thinking she would cover it. Also, before going out, she asked if he wanted to go out for a birthday dinner. He mentions he's broke after paying off a loan.\n\nFirst, the main points: Did the author do something wrong? Let's consider both sides. The sister sent a birthday message, which is a common thing. The author replied, which is a natural response. The girlfriend's issue is with phone use during dinner. That's a common pet peeve for many people. If she's already sensitive about that, then replying to the message might trigger her. But the author might argue he just replied quickly and didn't mean to ignore her.\n\nThen the financial aspect: He thought she would pay, but she didn't. He had to cover it, and he's broke. That's a point of contention. However, the girlfriend asked if he wanted to go out for dinner, implying it might be a shared activity. If he assumed she would pay because it was her idea or because it was her asking, but she didn't mention payment, maybe the author's assumption was flawed. But in many relationships, splitting the bill or taking turns is common. If he expected her to pay, and she thought he would, that's a misunderstanding.\n\nThe sister's message was a birthday message. Replying to that is reasonable. However, if the girlfriend has a rule about phone use, especially in a romantic setting, then the author might have crossed a line by even looking at his phone. The key here is whether the author's action of replying was a breach of an established boundary. If the girlfriend has communicated that she doesn't like phone use during meals, then yes, he's in the wrong for even checking his phone. If not, maybe not. But since the girlfriend is the one who set the rule, and the author knew that, then he's at fault.\n\nFinancially, if he thought she would pay but she didn't, that's another layer. However, without prior agreement, assuming someone else will pay can lead to issues. The author might be at fault for not clarifying who would pay, especially since he's broke. The girlfriend might have expected him to pay, or maybe she thought it was a different situation. Either way, the author's assumption led to a problem.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The main issue is the phone use. If the girlfriend has a clear boundary against phone use during meals, then the author violated that, leading to her not talking to him. The financial part is a separate issue but also a matter of assumptions. The sister's message isn't his fault, but responding to it during a date where phones are off-limits is where the problem lies. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for breaking the established boundary.\n"
