Afterwards she wouldn't talk to me the rest of the night.  I'm still pissed off, I can never catch a break.  I also had to pay for dinner, I assumed she was paying.  I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they did the wrong thing by replying to their sister's birthday message while they were out to eat with their girlfriend. The sister doesn't like when they use their phone during meals. After replying, the girlfriend didn't talk to them the rest of the night. Also, they had to pay for dinner, thinking the girlfriend would. They mention they paid off a loan and were low on cash.\n\nFirst, the main issue is using the phone in front of the girlfriend. The sister's message was a birthday wish, which is a common thing to respond to. However, the girlfriend's dislike for phone use during meals is a personal boundary. The author's action might have crossed that boundary, leading to the girlfriend being upset. \n\nThen there's the part about paying for dinner. The author assumed the girlfriend would pay, but she didn't. They had to use their savings, which they emptied to pay a loan. The question here is about expectations. If the girlfriend didn't mention paying, maybe the author should have clarified before the dinner. But if the girlfriend was supposed to pay and didn't, that's on her. However, the author's anger might be because they were in a tight financial situation, which adds context.\n\nSo, the key points are: replying to the sister vs. respecting the girlfriend's boundaries, and the financial misunderstanding. The author might be in the wrong for not considering the girlfriend's feelings about phone use. But the financial part could be a mutual misunderstanding. However, the main issue seems to be the phone use. The answer might be A because the author didn't respect the girlfriend's preference, leading to conflict. But some might argue that responding to a birthday message is reasonable. However, the girlfriend's discomfort is valid, so the author's action was inconsiderate. Hence, answer A.\n"
