Afterwards she wouldn't talk to me the rest of the night.  I'm still pissed off, I can never catch a break.  I also had to pay for dinner, I assumed she was paying.  I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for replying to their sister's birthday message during dinner with their girlfriend. The girlfriend doesn't like phone use when they're out. The author feels justified because they thought the girlfriend was paying, but ended up paying themselves, which added to their frustration.\n\nFirst, the main issue is the phone use. The girlfriend has already expressed that she doesn't like when he uses his phone during dinner. Even if it was a birthday message, checking the phone could be seen as a breach of their established boundary. The author might argue it was just a quick reply, but if that's a recurring issue, it's a valid point.\n\nThen there's the financial part. The author paid for dinner, thinking the girlfriend would cover it. They had emptied their accounts to pay off a loan, so this might have been a financial strain. The girlfriend might have expected him to know she was paying, or maybe she didn't communicate her expectation clearly. Either way, the author's assumption could lead to a misunderstanding.\n\nThe sister's message was likely a nice gesture, but the timing and context matter. The author's reaction of being \"pissed off\" might be a mix of both the phone issue and the dinner payment. The girlfriend's silence for the rest of the night suggests she was upset, which the author might not see as their fault if they feel they were just replying to a message and didn't know about the payment expectation.\n\nConsidering all factors, the author's actions on the phone might have crossed the girlfriend's boundaries, contributing to the conflict. The financial misunderstanding adds another layer. Whether the author is in the wrong depends on whether the phone use was a direct violation of their agreed-upon behavior and if the payment expectation was clear. If the girlfriend had already set that boundary, the author is in the wrong for disregarding it. However, the financial part is more about communication breakdown. So maybe the author is partially at fault but not entirely.\n"
