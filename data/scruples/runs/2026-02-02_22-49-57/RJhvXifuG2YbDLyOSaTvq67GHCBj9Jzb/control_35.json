Afterwards she wouldn't talk to me the rest of the night.  I'm still pissed off, I can never catch a break.  I also had to pay for dinner, I assumed she was paying.  I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the message is in the wrong. The situation involves replying to a sister's birthday message while on a dinner date with his girlfriend. The sister doesn't like when he uses his phone during their time together. After replying, the girlfriend didn't talk to him for the rest of the night. Also, he had to pay for dinner, thinking she would cover it. He mentions he's broke after paying off a loan.\n\nFirst, the main issue is using the phone during the date. The girlfriend has expressed discomfort with phone use when they're out. Replying to a birthday message might be seen as prioritizing the sister over the girlfriend's feelings. Even if it's a quick response, it could come off as dismissive. \n\nThen there's the financial aspect. The girlfriend assumed she would pay, but he ended up paying. If he didn't communicate that he couldn't afford it, maybe he should have been clearer. But if he thought she would pay and didn't clarify, that's on him. \n\nHe also mentions he was stressed about finances. That adds context. However, his actions (phone use and not clarifying payment) might have contributed to the girlfriend's upset. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? The phone use likely hurt her feelings, and not clarifying payment led to an unexpected expense. He might be at fault for not considering her feelings and not communicating his financial situation. But the sister's message was a birthday wish, which is understandable to respond to. It's a balance between respecting both relationships. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction (not talking for the rest of the night) is harsh, but maybe he could have handled it better. He should have considered her feelings about phone use and communicated his financial situation to avoid the payment issue. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for those oversights.\n"
