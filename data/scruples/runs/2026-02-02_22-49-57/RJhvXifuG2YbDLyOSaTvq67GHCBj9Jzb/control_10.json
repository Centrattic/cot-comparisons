Afterwards she wouldn't talk to me the rest of the night.  I'm still pissed off, I can never catch a break.  I also had to pay for dinner, I assumed she was paying.  I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation (the author) is in the wrong. The main points are:\n\n1. The author replied to his sister's birthday message while out to eat with his girlfriend. The girlfriend doesn't like him using his phone when they're out.\n2. After replying, the girlfriend didn't talk to him the rest of the night.\n3. The author ended up paying for dinner, assuming she would pay, and was upset because he just paid off a loan and had no money left.\n4. Before going out, the girlfriend asked if he wanted to go out for a birthday dinner, and he agreed without knowing he'd have to pay.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault here.\n\nFirst, the phone use. The girlfriend had previously expressed that she doesn't like when he uses his phone during their time together. So, by replying to his sister's message, the author did something his girlfriend found disrespectful or inconsiderate. Even though it was a birthday message, ignoring it might have been the better choice to avoid conflict. So, that part might be on him.\n\nSecond, the payment issue. Before going out, the girlfriend asked if he wanted to go out for dinner. The author assumed she would pay, but she didn't. The author might have thought that by asking, she was offering to pay. However, in many social situations, unless specified, people might assume splitting the bill or taking turns. The author's assumption could be a misstep here. He didn't clarify who was paying, which led to an unexpected expense for him, especially when he was in a tight financial spot. So, maybe he's at fault for not confirming payment arrangements.\n\nPutting it all together: The author did two things that caused issues. Using his phone went against his girlfriend's preference, and he didn't clarify payment, leading to an unexpected expense. Both actions could be seen as his fault. However, the girlfriend's reaction (not talking the rest of the night) seems harsh, but the initial actions were his. So, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't respect her wishes about phone use and didn't clarify payment, leading to both issues.\n"
