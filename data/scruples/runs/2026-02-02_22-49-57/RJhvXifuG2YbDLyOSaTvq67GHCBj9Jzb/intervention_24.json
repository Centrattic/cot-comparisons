Afterwards she wouldn't talk to me the rest of the night.  I'm still pissed off, I can never catch a break.  I also had to pay for dinner, I assumed she was paying.  I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is about replying to a sister's birthday message while on a dinner date with their girlfriend. The sister doesn't like when the author uses his phone, which led to her being upset for the rest of the night. Also, the author ended up paying for dinner, thinking his girlfriend would cover it. He mentions he had just paid off a loan and was broke.\n\nFirst, the main issue is using the phone in front of the girlfriend. The sister's message was a birthday greeting, which is a common and polite thing to respond to. However, the girlfriend's dislike of phone use during meals is a personal boundary. The author might have breached that boundary, leading to her being upset. But was that his fault? If the girlfriend had communicated her feelings about phone use before the dinner, maybe the author should have been aware. However, if she didn't make it clear, the author might not be entirely at fault. \n\nThen there's the payment issue. The author thought the girlfriend would pay, but she didn't. This could be a miscommunication. If the girlfriend had mentioned she wanted to pay, but the author didn't clarify, that's a problem. But if there was no prior agreement, maybe the author's assumption isn't entirely wrong. However, assuming someone will pay without confirming can lead to issues. \n\nThe author also mentions he was broke and had to pay, which adds to his frustration. The sister's message timing might not have been the main issue; the girlfriend's reaction seems more about the phone use. The key points are communication and boundaries. If the girlfriend had explicitly stated her discomfort with phone use during meals, the author should have respected that. If not, then the author's response to a birthday message might be understandable, even if it upset her. \n\nOverall, the author might not be entirely in the wrong, but there's a nuance. The main issue is the phone use, which could have been avoided if both parties were clear about their expectations. The payment part is more of a miscommunication. So, the answer could lean towards the author not being in the wrong, but maybe there's a lesson in better communication from both sides.\n"
