I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. Let's break down the situation.\n\nSo, the author's sister messaged him \"Happy Birthday\" while they were out to eat. The author replied, but his girlfriend doesn't like it when he uses his phone during their outings. After replying, the girlfriend didn't talk to him the rest of the night. Also, the author ended up paying for dinner, thinking his girlfriend would, and he was short on cash because he had just paid off a loan.\n\nThe author is upset that he had to pay, didn't expect that, and is frustrated about the whole situation. His sister initiated the message, and he answered, which led to the girlfriend being upset. \n\nFirst, replying to a birthday message seems reasonable, especially if it's unexpected. It's a common courtesy to respond to a birthday wish. However, the girlfriend's rule about not using phones during meals is a boundary she set. The author might have known this and still replied, which could be where he's at fault. If he knew beforehand that she didn't like phone use during dinners, responding might have been disrespectful to her wishes.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister's message was a surprise. The author might not have realized the message came in until after they arrived, so it's not like he was on his phone the whole time. Also, there's the issue of the dinner payment. The author assumed his girlfriend would pay, but she didn't, leading to him having to use his hard-earned money. That's a separate issue, possibly a communication problem between them about splitting the bill or expectations.\n\nBut the main question is about replying to the sister. If the girlfriend had already expressed a preference not to use phones during meals, then the author should have either avoided using the phone or discussed it beforehand. If he didn't know or forgot, that's different. However, the sister's message was a direct birthday wish, which is a valid reason to respond. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction of not talking for the rest of the night seems harsh, but maybe she's sensitive about phone use. The author's frustration about paying is also valid if there was a misunderstanding about the bill. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might be at fault for replying to the sister despite the girlfriend's preferences, but there's context. However, the sister's message was unexpected, and the payment issue adds another layer. It's not entirely clear if the author was wrong, but there are points on both sides. Maybe the main issue is that he didn't consider her feelings about phone use during their outing, which could be his mistake. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for that part, but the payment issue is a different matter. Since the question is specifically about replying to the sister, the answer hinges on respecting the girlfriend's boundaries.\n"
