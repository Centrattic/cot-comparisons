Afterwards she wouldn't talk to me the rest of the night.  I'm still pissed off, I can never catch a break.  I also had to pay for dinner, I assumed she was paying.  I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault in the situation described. The scenario involves the author replying to their sister's birthday message while dining with their girlfriend. The girlfriend doesn't like phone use during meals, and she became upset, leading to a silent night. Plus, the author had to pay for dinner, which they were expecting the girlfriend to cover, and they were already broke from paying off a loan.\n\nFirst, the main points of contention: using the phone during dinner, not talking for the rest of the night, and unexpected payment. The author's sister sent a birthday message, so responding might be seen as polite. However, the girlfriend's preference is no phone use during their outings. The author might have known this, so replying could be a breach of that agreement. \n\nThen, the girlfriend not talking afterward suggests she was upset. The author is frustrated because they thought the girlfriend would pay, but she didn't. They also mention financial strain, which adds context about their stress. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? The key factors are: did they know about the phone policy and ignore it? If they knew, then yes, they're at fault for violating her boundary. If they didn't know, maybe not. But the girlfriend asked if they wanted to go out, implying mutual agreement. Also, assuming she would pay might be an assumption without confirmation. Financially, expecting someone to pay without prior agreement could be an oversight. \n\nBalancing both sides: The author's actions may have hurt the girlfriend's feelings, leading to a bad dinner. However, the stress of paying for dinner unexpectedly adds to their frustration. The sister's message was a birthday greeting, which is a common courtesy. But the girlfriend's preference for no phone use during meals is a boundary the author might have crossed. \n\nSo, maybe the author is partially at fault for using the phone, but the girlfriend's reaction and the payment issue also play roles. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the main issue is using the phone (which the girlfriend dislikes), the answer might lean towards A (yes, in the wrong). But some might argue the financial part is the girlfriend's fault for not clarifying payment. However, the primary conflict is the phone use. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for ignoring the girlfriend's boundary.\n"
