Afterwards she wouldn't talk to me the rest of the night.  I'm still pissed off, I can never catch a break.  I also had to pay for dinner, I assumed she was paying.  I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who posted this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a birthday dinner with his girlfriend where he replied to his sister's message, which upset her. She didn't talk to him the rest of the night. Then there's the issue of him having to pay for dinner because he thought she was paying. He mentions he emptied his savings to pay off a loan, so he didn't want to pay for dinner.\n\nFirst, the phone use: The girlfriend doesn't like him using his phone when they're out. He replied to his sister's birthday message. Even if it's a brief reply, using the phone at all might have been disrespectful to her. She's his girlfriend, so respecting her boundaries is important. If she said she doesn't like it, then using the phone even once could be seen as dismissive.\n\nThen, the dinner payment issue. The user assumed she would pay, but she ended up not paying. That's a problem because assuming someone else will pay without confirming can lead to misunderstandings. The girlfriend might have felt he was inconsiderate for not clarifying. Also, since he was broke, he might have been stressed, but he still made the decision to go out without confirming payment. Maybe he should have communicated his financial situation better if he was worried about paying.\n\nPutting it all together: He used his phone against her wishes, leading to her upset. Then, he had to pay for dinner because of a misunderstanding. Both actions could be seen as his fault. The sister's message was probably a simple \"Happy Birthday,\" which he could have replied to in a different way or maybe even later to avoid the conflict. Also, the payment issue shows poor communication. So, the answer is A.\n"
