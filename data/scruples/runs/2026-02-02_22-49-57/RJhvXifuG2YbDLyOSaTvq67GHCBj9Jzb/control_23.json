I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for replying to their sister's birthday message when they were out to eat with their girlfriend. The girlfriend doesn't like when he uses his phone during meals, and after the reply, she didn't talk to him the rest of the night. Also, he ended up paying for dinner, thinking she would, and he was broke because he had just paid off a loan.\n\nFirst, the phone use. The girlfriend had expressed that she doesn't like him using his phone when they're out. So by replying to the sister's message, he disregarded her preference. That's a clear boundary he crossed, which could explain her being upset. So that part of the situation, he's in the wrong for not respecting her wishes.\n\nThen, the payment issue. He mentions he assumed she would pay, but he ended up paying because he was broke. However, the girlfriend didn't clarify that she couldn't pay, so maybe there's some misunderstanding here. But assuming things in a relationship can lead to problems. If he knew he was broke, he should have communicated that before agreeing to pay. But since he thought she would cover it, maybe he didn't. Still, the main issue seems to be the phone use, which directly led to her not talking to him for the rest of the night. \n\nThe sister's message was a birthday wish, which is a personal matter. However, if the girlfriend has a rule about phone use during dates or meals, the author should prioritize that to maintain harmony. The fact that he replied immediately might have made the girlfriend feel ignored or disrespected. \n\nIn terms of the payment, while he was in a financial tight spot, not communicating about his ability to pay could be an issue. But the primary conflict here is the phone use. The girlfriend's reaction was to stop talking to him, which seems extreme, but her feelings about phone use are valid. The author's mistake was not respecting her boundary, leading to her being upset. \n\nSo, overall, the main fault is on the author for not adhering to the girlfriend's preferences regarding phone use during their dinner. The payment issue is a separate problem but less directly related to the conflict described. Therefore, the answer is A, he's in the wrong.\n"
