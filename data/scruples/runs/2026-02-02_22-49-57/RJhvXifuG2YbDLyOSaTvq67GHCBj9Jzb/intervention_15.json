      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA question. So, the user is asking if they're in the wrong for replying to their sister's birthday message when they were out to dinner with their girlfriend. The sister doesn't like when he uses his phone during their dates. After he responded, she didn't talk to him the rest of the night. Also, he had to pay for dinner, assuming she would, and he's broke after paying off a loan.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The main points are:\n\n1. The author replied to his sister's message during dinner with his girlfriend. The girlfriend has a policy against phone use when they're out. This led to her being upset and not talking to him the rest of the night. The author is upset about this and also had to pay for dinner, which he didn't expect because he's broke.\n\n2. The sister asked if he wanted to go out for birthday dinner, so he might have thought she was the one paying. But maybe that's an assumption. The key here is whether he did something wrong by replying to his sister or if the girlfriend overreacted.\n\nNow, considering social norms. It's common for people to have expectations about phone use during dates. If the girlfriend has communicated that she doesn't like phone use during their time together, then the author might be in the wrong for not respecting her boundary. Even if it was just a birthday message, using the phone could be seen as a breach of that agreement.\n\nOn the other hand, the sister did reach out on his birthday, which is a special day. Maybe the author felt it was important to respond. But the issue here is the girlfriend's feelings. The girlfriend's reaction (not talking for the rest of the night) seems extreme, but if she had previously communicated her dislike for phone use during meals, he should have respected that.\n\nAnother angle is the payment part. The author assumed the sister would pay, but the girlfriend ended up paying. If the sister had asked him if he wanted to go out for dinner, maybe there was an unspoken expectation that she would cover the cost. But in many cultures, when someone invites you to dinner, they might expect to split the bill or have it depend on the relationship. However, since he's broke and didn't mention this to his girlfriend beforehand, maybe he should have clarified the payment arrangement. But the main issue is the phone use.\n\nSo, balancing both sides: the author didn't do anything illegal, but he might have ignored a boundary set by his girlfriend. The girlfriend's reaction was harsh, but if she had communicated her feelings about phone use, the author is responsible for respecting that. The payment issue is a separate problem, but his assumption about who pays might be a point of contention. However, the main question is about replying to the sister's message. If the girlfriend had a known issue with phone use during dates, then the author is in the wrong for not honoring her preference. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (Yes, he's in the wrong) regarding the phone use, but the payment issue is a separate matter. However, the user is specifically asking about replying to the sister, so focusing there. The answer is likely A.\n"
