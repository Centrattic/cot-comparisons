Afterwards she wouldn't talk to me the rest of the night.  I'm still pissed off, I can never catch a break.  I also had to pay for dinner, I assumed she was paying.  I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for replying to their sister's birthday message when they were out to eat with their girlfriend. The girlfriend doesn't like when they use their phone during meals. The sister just sent \"Happy Birthday,\" which is a common and polite message. The user replied, which might have upset the girlfriend because she's against phone use during their time together.\n\nThe user is upset because they had to pay for dinner, thinking their girlfriend would cover it, and they were already financially strained from paying off a loan. The girlfriend asked if they wanted to go out for a birthday dinner, but the user didn't know they had to pay. The user is now frustrated because they felt the situation wasn't fair, especially after just emptying their savings.\n\nConsidering the points:\n- Replying to a birthday message is a small act. It's a polite response to a family member, which is understandable.\n- The girlfriend's rule about phones might be reasonable, but the user didn't know that the dinner was on them, leading to unexpected expenses.\n- The user might have felt the situation was unfair, especially given their financial situation. However, they didn't clarify the payment arrangement beforehand, which could be a point of contention.\n- The girlfriend's reaction of not talking for the rest of the night might be an overreaction, but the user's reply could have triggered it if phone use is a strict rule.\n\nIs the user in the wrong? They did reply to a message, but it's a minor action. However, not discussing the payment expectation beforehand and the subsequent argument might have contributed to the problem. The girlfriend's rules about phones could be a separate issue. The user's frustration is valid given the financial aspect, but maybe they should have clarified the payment before agreeing to the dinner. So, the user might share some blame for not communicating about the payment. But the act of replying itself isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nI think the answer is B (No), but with some nuance. The user isn't entirely in the wrong, but there are elements where communication could have been better.\n"
