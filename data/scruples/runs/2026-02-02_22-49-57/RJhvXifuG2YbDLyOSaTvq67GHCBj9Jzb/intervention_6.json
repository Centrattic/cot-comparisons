Afterwards she wouldn't talk to me the rest of the night.  I'm still pissed off, I can never catch a break.  I also had to pay for dinner, I assumed she was paying.  I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for replying to his sister's birthday message while out to eat with his girlfriend. His girlfriend doesn't like him using his phone, and after that, she wouldn't talk to him the rest of the night. Also, he ended up paying for dinner, thinking she would, and he's upset because he just paid off a loan and was broke.\n\nFirst, the main issue is the phone use. The girlfriend had previously expressed discomfort with him using his phone when they're out. So even though the sister's message was a birthday wish, which is a personal thing, the girlfriend's feelings about phone use during their time together might be a boundary that the author should respect. The author might have thought it was okay to reply quickly, but the girlfriend's reaction suggests that this was a point of contention for her. So maybe he didn't consider her feelings enough in that moment.\n\nThen there's the dinner payment. The author thought the girlfriend was paying, but she didn't. He felt he was already broke, which adds to his frustration. The girlfriend might not have communicated her expectation clearly. If she didn't mention paying beforehand, maybe it's not entirely his fault, but assuming someone will pay without confirmation can lead to misunderstandings. \n\nThe sister's question about dinner was about whether he wanted to go out for his birthday. The author went along without knowing he'd have to pay, which is a valid point. But the main issue here is the phone use during dinner. The girlfriend's displeasure over the phone reply led to her not talking to him, which he's still upset about. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? On one hand, he replied to a family message, which is understandable. On the other, he knew the girlfriend disliked phone use during their time together. Not heeding her previous request could be seen as disregarding her boundaries. The dinner payment is more of a communication issue on both sides. \n\nBut the key is the phone use. If he knew she didn't like it, replying might have been a mistake. However, some might argue that a birthday message is important. It's a balance between respecting her feelings and his own. Considering the girlfriend's reaction, maybe the author should have found another time to reply or explained it to her. So, maybe he is partially at fault. Answer A.\n"
