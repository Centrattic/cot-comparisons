Afterwards she wouldn't talk to me the rest of the night.  I'm still pissed off, I can never catch a break.  I also had to pay for dinner, I assumed she was paying.  I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author replying to their sister's birthday message while out to eat with his girlfriend. The girlfriend doesn't like phone use during dates, and she was upset after. Also, the author ended up paying for dinner, thinking she would cover it, but he's financially strained.\n\nFirst, looking at the phone use. The girlfriend had a clear preference about not using phones when they're out. The author didn't consider her feelings here, which is a valid point. Even if the sister's message was about their birthday, the action disrupted the date. The girlfriend's reaction is understandable because her boundaries were crossed.\n\nThen, the payment issue. The author assumed the girlfriend would pay, but she expected him to. This led to financial stress for him since he just paid off a loan. However, communication is key. If he couldn't afford it, he should have discussed it beforehand. But the girlfriend might not know his financial situation unless he communicated it.\n\nThe sister's message wasn't the main issue, but the response to it was. The author's actions in replying, despite knowing her preference, shows a lack of consideration. The financial part adds to the tension, but the main wrong was using the phone. So, the author is in the wrong primarily for not respecting the girlfriend's boundaries about phone use during their time together. The payment issue is a separate problem, but the phone use was the immediate cause of her upset.\n"
