I should also add, before we went out she asked something along the lines of \"do you want to go out for a birthday dinner?\" I wouldn't have went if I knew I was paying because I just emptied my savings and checking to pay off a loan.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves replying to a sister's birthday message during a dinner date with their girlfriend. The girlfriend doesn't like him using his phone during meals, and after he replied, she stopped talking to him for the rest of the night. Also, he had to pay for dinner, thinking she would cover it, and he was broke from paying off a loan.\n\nFirst, the act of replying to a birthday message. It's a common courtesy to acknowledge someone's birthday, especially a family member. However, the girlfriend's preference is not to use phones during meals. The boyfriend's action might have been a breach of that boundary. Even if the message was brief, it could have been perceived as dismissive or disrespectful to her feelings about phone use.\n\nThen, the financial part: he thought she would pay, but she didn't. He was in a tight financial spot. This could add to his frustration, but maybe he should have clarified payment expectations beforehand. Maybe he assumed wrong, which could contribute to the tension. However, the girlfriend's reaction to the phone use led to her not talking to him, which complicates things.\n\nThe sister's message was a simple \"Happy Birthday,\" so the response was likely short. But the girlfriend's sensitivity to phone use is a known issue. If he's aware of her dislike for phone use during meals and still does it, he's in the wrong. Intentionally or not, he violated her boundary, leading to her withdrawal. The financial aspect might be a red herring here, but it's a valid stressor for him.\n\nSo, considering the girlfriend's established preferences and the impact of his actions, he's at fault for not respecting her boundaries. The sister's message is a minor justification, but the bigger issue is the girlfriend's comfort. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
