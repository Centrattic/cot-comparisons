We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves an unexpected pregnancy after a breakup, and the author wants to avoid any financial or parental responsibilities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, once a child is born, the father has legal obligations to provide financial support, which can't usually be waived completely. The father can't just sign away all rights before the child is born. So legally, the author might not have the option to entirely opt out. But the mother might be able to give up the child for adoption, but the father's rights are a separate issue. If he's biologically the father, he might still be legally responsible.\n\nThen there's the ethical side. The author was clear about not wanting kids, but the mother chose to keep the child regardless of the father's wishes. The author is now facing a situation he never wanted. On one hand, he's being blamed for being selfish, but on the other, he didn't choose to be a parent. However, some might argue that using contraception isn't foolproof, and both parties have responsibilities. The mother also made a decision to continue the pregnancy without considering the father's stance, which complicates things.\n\nThe author has moved on with a new partner, and this situation is causing him significant stress. He's not being cruel or violent, just refusing to take on responsibilities. But in many places, child support is mandatory regardless of the father's consent. So he might not have a legal way out, which means the moral question is whether he's being unreasonable. \n\nSome might say that even if he didn't want to be a parent, he should support the child financially. Others might empathize with his position, given his prior stance and the circumstances. There's no clear right or wrong here, but legally, he's probably in a position where he can't just walk away. Morally, it's a tough call between his wishes and the rights of the child and mother.\n\nI think the answer is that he's not in the wrong morally, but legally he might have obligations he can't avoid. The key is whether he's being responsible versus selfish. Since he's not trying to harm anyone, just avoid what he never wanted, maybe the answer is B. But I'm a bit conflicted because of the legal side. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not legal consequences. So morally, maybe he's not in the wrong.\n"
