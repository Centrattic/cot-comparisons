We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting a \"financial abortion,\" which means not taking responsibility for the child financially. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author was in a relationship that ended a few months ago. They were clear about not wanting kids. Then the ex contacts him, says she's pregnant and wants support. He refuses to get back together and wants nothing to do with the child. He's now with a new partner and a new apartment, and this situation is causing him a lot of stress. He wants to cut all ties, no child support, no custody. Her friends are calling him selfish.\n\nLegally, I know that in many places, fathers are required to pay child support once paternity is established. Even if the father doesn't want custody, he might still have legal obligations. So legally, the author might not have a choice here. But the question is about moral and ethical responsibility. \n\nMoral-wise, some people might argue that he's responsible because he's the father, even if the pregnancy happened after a breakup. Others might say that since he made his stance clear about not wanting kids and the mother continued the pregnancy despite knowing his position, she's responsible. But there's also the argument that both parties should have taken more precautions with contraception. \n\nThe author mentions they were using contraceptives, but maybe they failed. However, it's a joint responsibility, so blaming the mother might not be fair. The mother is choosing to keep the child, so she's committed to raising it. If the author walks away, it's the child who suffers. So morally, some might say he's selfish for not taking responsibility.\n\nOn the other hand, if he never wanted kids and made that clear, some might empathize with his position. But the key point is that once a child is born, the father has responsibilities regardless of intent. The term \"financial abortion\" isn't a legal term; it's more of a way to describe cutting financial ties, which might not be possible.\n\nSo considering both legal and moral aspects, the author might be in the wrong because he can't legally avoid child support, and morally, he's responsible for the child's well-being. The ex's friends saying he's selfish could be valid, as he's refusing to support a child he helped create. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong). But I need to check if there's any nuance I'm missing. For example, some jurisdictions might allow disestablishing parentage if it's proven that the father had no knowledge or consent, but that's complicated. If he can prove he was unaware, maybe there's a legal way out, but generally, once paternity is established, support is required. So legally and morally, he's likely in the wrong.\n"
