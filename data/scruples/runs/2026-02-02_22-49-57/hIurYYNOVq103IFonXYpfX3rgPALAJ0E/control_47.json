We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong based on the given situation. The scenario involves an unexpected pregnancy after a breakup, and the author's desire to disengage completely from the child's life. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many jurisdictions, fathers are legally required to provide financial support for their children, regardless of their desire to be involved. So, the author can't just opt out of child support. That's a key point.\n\nMoral responsibility is a bit trickier. The author was clear about not wanting kids, but if they were sexually active and didn't use contraception perfectly, there's a shared responsibility. However, some might argue that since the pregnancy occurred without the author's consent or knowledge, he's not entirely at fault. But others might say that engaging in a sexual relationship implies some level of responsibility, even if birth control was used.\n\nThe author's current situation with a new partner and a new home might add to the stress, but that doesn't necessarily excuse not supporting his own child. The mother's friends are criticizing him as selfish, which could indicate societal expectations of parental responsibility. \n\nHowever, the author isn't refusing to acknowledge paternity; he's just not wanting to be involved. Legally, he might have to accept paternity, which would obligate him to pay child support. Morally, people might have different views. Some might see his stance as selfish, while others might empathize with his situation, especially if the pregnancy was truly unexpected and he was clear about not wanting children.\n\nI should also consider the fact that the mother is keeping the child, and the author can't force an abortion or adoption. So he's left with financial responsibility. Whether he's in the wrong depends on cultural and personal values. Legally, he's not wrong, but morally, it's a gray area. The question is whether he's in the wrong, not just legally. The user is asking for a moral judgment, not just a legal one. \n\nIn many social contexts, fathers are expected to support their children financially, even if they don't want to be involved. So, the author might be seen as morally in the wrong for refusing financial support. However, the initial breakup and the mother's decision to pursue the pregnancy without contact might add complexity. \n\nI think the answer is that the author is in the wrong (A) because he is avoiding responsibility for a child he helped create, even if he didn't plan for it. Society generally expects financial support for children, and while it's not his fault the pregnancy happened, he does have a duty to support his child. So, the answer is A.\n"
