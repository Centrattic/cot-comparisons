We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is asking if they're the asshole for wanting a financial abortion. So first, what's a financial abortion? From what I know, it's when a person doesn't want to be a parent but also doesn't want the child to be born, so they pay for an abortion. But in this case, the author is talking about after the fact\u2014the child is already confirmed to be theirs, and the mother is keeping it. So the author wants to cut all ties, no support, no custody, etc.\n\nThe situation: They had a relationship, broke up months ago, no contact. Then she gets pregnant, contacts him, wants to get back together. He refuses, says he doesn't want kids. Now she's determined to keep the child. He's in a new relationship, new apartment, and feels this is a huge disruption. He's looking for legal ways to disassociate himself financially.\n\nSo the question is whether he's in the wrong. Legally, in most places, fathers have to provide child support regardless of their consent to the pregnancy, especially if paternity is established. So he can't just walk away. But morally, it's tricky. He clearly didn't want kids and was upfront. But he was a participant in the relationship, and the pregnancy happened despite precautions. Does he have a responsibility now?\n\nThe mother's friends are calling him selfish. That's their opinion, but maybe they're right? If he's a biological father, even if he's not the one who wanted the child, he has some responsibility. However, he's not in a relationship with the mother anymore. The mother made the decision to keep the child, so she's the one carrying it. But the child is his, and in many legal systems, he can't opt out of financial support.\n\nMoral arguments might say that he's responsible because he's part of the situation, even if he didn't want the child. On the other hand, he was clear about not wanting kids, and the pregnancy happened despite precautions. But he can't control the mother's choice to carry the child. He can't force an abortion, and he can't avoid financial responsibility.\n\nLegally, he's probably in the wrong if he refuses child support. But the question here is about being an asshole, not the legalities. Morally, is it selfish to not want to be involved? It's a tough call. He's prioritizing his own life and new relationship. But the child is his, and he might be seen as abandoning responsibility. However, he's not in a position to force an abortion or adoption, so his hands are tied in that aspect.\n\nSo, considering all that, is he in the wrong? If he's legally required to pay support, but morally, he's being blamed for not wanting to be a parent, it's a complex situation. The answer might depend on cultural or personal beliefs. But in terms of the classic \"Am I the asshole?\" question, the community might see him as the asshole for not being responsible, even if he had no intention of being a parent. Alternatively, some might empathize with his position since he was clear about his stance.\n"
