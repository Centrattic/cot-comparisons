We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong for wanting a financial abortion. The scenario is that they broke up with a girl months ago, had no contact, then she got pregnant and wants him to be involved. He never wanted kids, is in a new relationship, and doesn't want any responsibility for the child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, once a child is born, the father has legal obligations, including child support. Even if he doesn't want to be involved, the law might require him to pay. So wanting to resign all rights and responsibilities might not be legally feasible. He can't just walk away from child support if he's the legal father. That's a key point.\n\nThen there's the moral side. Is it selfish to not want to support a child he didn't plan? Arguments could be made that he's responsible because he's the biological father, even if the relationship ended. However, since they were using contraception and the pregnancy happened unexpectedly, maybe there's some shared responsibility there. But once the child is born, parental responsibility is often seen as a duty regardless of the circumstances.\n\nThe fact that they broke up and hadn't spoken for months complicates things. The mother is keeping the child, and he's not willing to be part of the child's life. The mother's friends are calling him selfish, but from his perspective, he didn't consent to having a child and is struggling with the situation.\n\nLegally, termination options depend on the country. If the pregnancy is in its early stages, maybe an abortion is an option, but the user says the mother is dead set on keeping the baby. Once the child is born, he can't avoid support. So he's stuck with legal obligations even if he doesn't want to be part of the child's life.\n\nMorally, some might say he's responsible because he's the father, but others might empathize with his position of not wanting to be a parent. However, denying child support could be seen as morally wrong because the child's needs are separate from the parents' relationship issues.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Legally, he can't just disown the child once it's born. Morally, it's a tough call, but many would argue he has a responsibility as the father. Therefore, he's in the wrong because he's trying to avoid legal obligations and moral responsibilities. The answer is A.\n"
