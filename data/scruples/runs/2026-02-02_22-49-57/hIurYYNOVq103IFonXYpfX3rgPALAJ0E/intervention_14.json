We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for wanting to avoid financial responsibility for a child they didn't want. The situation is that they were in a relationship that ended, there was a pregnancy, and the ex wants them to be involved. The author is clear they don't want kids and are refusing to pay child support or have any contact.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, fathers are legally obligated to pay child support even if they don't want custody. So the author might not have a legal choice in the matter. Legally, they might be in trouble if they refuse to pay. But the question is about being in the wrong morally or ethically, not just legally.\n\nMorally, it's a bit more complex. The author was in a relationship where they were clear about not wanting kids. But they broke up months before the pregnancy. If they were using contraception correctly, the pregnancy shouldn't have happened. However, maybe there was a time when they didn't use protection. The ex reached out after a long break, and now wants support.\n\nThe author is in a new relationship and has a new life. They're struggling with the idea of being a father they never wanted. They're not forcing the mother to get an abortion, which is important. They're just trying to avoid financial responsibility. The ex's friends are calling them selfish, but the author feels they're being fair by taking no responsibility.\n\nI think the key points are: the author was clear about not wanting kids, the pregnancy happened after the breakup, and the author is not trying to force the mother into any action. Legally, they might still be obligated, but morally, they might not be in the wrong. People have the right to make their own choices, especially about having children. The author isn't taking away the mother's rights, just stating their own. However, some might argue that being a parent comes with responsibilities regardless of the circumstances. But the author is taking the position that they never wanted the child and are not going to support it. It's a tough situation, but given the information, the author might not be in the wrong. So the answer would be B.\n"
