We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author was in a relationship that didn't last. They ended things, had no contact for months, and then the ex reached out saying she's pregnant. The author made it clear they never wanted kids, and they're now in a new relationship and a new apartment. The ex wants to get back together, but the author rejects that. The author is considering a \"financial abortion,\" which I think means not taking any responsibility for the child, like no child support, custody, etc. The author is being called selfish by the ex's friends but is struggling with the situation.\n\nFirst, I should consider legal aspects. In most places, I think fathers are legally required to provide child support once paternity is established. The author might not be able to legally opt out of that. So even if they want to, the law might not allow them to completely disengage. That's a point to note.\n\nThen there's the moral side. The author made it clear they didn't want kids, but they were in a relationship where they might have had sex without using contraception properly. Even if they were using contraceptives, accidents can happen. But the question is whether they're morally responsible. Some people might argue that since they contributed to the pregnancy, they have a responsibility, while others might say that if they clearly communicated their stance against children and the pregnancy happened after a breakup, they shouldn't be forced into parenthood.\n\nThe author's new relationship and life are being disrupted. They're under stress and want out. But the ex is determined to keep the child, so the author can't avoid responsibility by pushing for adoption or abortion. They have to take the consequences. But is it selfish to not want to pay for a child they don't want? That's a moral debate.\n\nThe ex's friends are calling the author selfish. That's a common reaction, but does that mean the author is in the wrong? It depends on cultural and personal beliefs. In some cultures, men are expected to step up, but others might prioritize personal choice and autonomy.\n\nAlso, the author is in a new relationship. The new girlfriend's perspective isn't mentioned here. If the author is in a committed new relationship, their actions might affect their current partner as well, but that's not discussed.\n\nSo, legally, the author might have to pay child support. Morally, it's a tougher call. If the author is against all forms of support, that's a problem because the law requires it. But if the author is just not wanting emotional involvement, they might have a point. However, financially they can't opt out. So in terms of being \"in the wrong,\" if they're following the law but refusing to pay (which they can't do), then maybe they are in the wrong if they try to evade legal obligations. But the question is more about whether they are morally wrong for wanting to disengage.\n\nIn summary, the author might be in a difficult situation, but morally, it's a gray area. Some people might say they are responsible because they contributed to the pregnancy, others might say they communicated their stance clearly. The key is that they can't legally opt out, so their desire for a \"financial abortion\" isn't feasible, but the question is about being in the wrong. If the author is following the law and just wants to avoid emotional involvement, maybe not. But if they try to avoid financial responsibility, that's where the issue is.\n"
