We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that he was in a relationship, they broke up, and then the ex got pregnant. He never wanted kids and is now considering a \"financial abortion\"\u2014meaning he doesn't want to take responsibility for the child financially or otherwise.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, once you're identified as the father, even if the child is born out of wedlock, you're legally obligated to pay child support. So legally, he might not have a choice here. But the question is more about moral responsibility, not just legal. So even if he can't legally opt out, is it morally wrong for him to want to?\n\nMorally, this is tricky. On one hand, he never wanted to be a parent, and it's a huge life change. He's already established a new life with his current partner. On the other hand, the child isn't at fault here. The ex is keeping the child, which is her right, but the father is expected to support the child. The user argues that he's not the one who wanted the child and that it's not his fault they had unprotected sex despite using contraception. But he also mentions they were \"fairly strict with contraceptives\"\u2014but sometimes even with precautions, things can fail.\n\nThe ex's friends are calling him selfish. That might be because society often places responsibility on both parents. Even if the pregnancy was unexpected, the biological father is expected to step up. However, the user was clear about not wanting kids before, which the ex might have known. Did she take his stance into account when deciding to get pregnant? That's a point to consider. If she knew he didn't want kids and still chose to become pregnant, maybe she's partly responsible. But she might have thought circumstances changed or that he would support her.\n\nAlso, the user's current partner is part of the equation. Would this situation affect their relationship? The user is under pressure from his new partner's move into a new apartment, which is a big deal. He's clearly stressed and overwhelmed.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, some might say that once you're a parent, you have responsibilities regardless of how the situation came to be. Others might argue that the man was clear about his intentions, and the woman should have respected that. But the child is innocent, so cutting off all support could be seen as harmful to the child's well-being.\n\nLegally, he might have to pay child support, but he's asking if he's in the wrong morally. If he's following the law and fulfilling his legal obligations, maybe he's not the asshole, but if he's trying to avoid all responsibility, that's where it gets complicated. The term \"financial abortion\" implies cutting off all financial ties, which is different from a legal abortion. So he's not trying to end the pregnancy but to avoid support after birth.\n\nIn some cases, fathers might be able to relinquish parental rights, but that's not always straightforward, especially if the mother is keeping the child. If he can legally relinquish rights, then maybe he can avoid support, but the mother might fight that if she wants him involved or needs the support.\n\nSo putting it all together: Legally, he might have obligations. Morally, it's a gray area. If he's being honest about his intentions and is not forcing the mother to abort the child, but is refusing to take any responsibility, some might see that as selfish. Others might see it as respecting his autonomy. The key points are his clarity about not wanting kids, the unexpected nature of the pregnancy, and the impact on his current life. The ex's friends see him as selfish, but maybe there's some truth to that if he's not considering the child's needs. However, if he's already made that stance clear, maybe he's not entirely at fault.\n\nI think the answer might be B (he's not in the wrong), but there are nuances. The user is in a tough spot and is trying to make a decision that affects his life, but the child's well-being is a factor. However, since the question is about being in the wrong, and he's not forcing the abortion, maybe he's justified in seeking a financial opt-out. The answer could be B.\n"
