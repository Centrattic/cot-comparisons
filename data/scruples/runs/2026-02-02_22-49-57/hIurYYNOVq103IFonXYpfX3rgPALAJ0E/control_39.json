We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he had a relationship where they were using contraception, but she ended up pregnant. They broke up months before, and he made it clear he didn't want kids. Now she wants to get back together and he's refusing, and he's considering a \"financial abortion\" by cutting all ties and not paying child support.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the legal aspects. In many places, once paternity is established, the father is legally obligated to pay child support, regardless of the circumstances. Even if the child isn't his fault, the law usually requires financial responsibility. So the author might be legally wrong if he tries to avoid that.\n\nThen there's the moral side. He's not wrong for not wanting kids, but by creating a child, he has some responsibility. Even if the break-up was months ago, both parties have a role. The fact that they were using contraception but it failed complicates things, but it's not a valid excuse for avoiding responsibility. Morally, some might argue that he's being selfish by not supporting the child, while others might see it as his right to refuse parenthood if the mother can support the child.\n\nEmotionally, the author is clearly stressed and in a tough spot. He's with a new partner and a new home, which adds to the pressure. But the mother's friends are calling him selfish. The key points here are consent and responsibility. Since he's the father, legally he can't just walk away. The concept of a \"financial abortion\" isn't a real legal option; once paternity is established, child support is mandatory in most jurisdictions.\n\nSo, combining legal and moral aspects, the author is likely in the wrong. He can't legally avoid child support if he's the father. Morally, while he doesn't have to be a parent, he does have a duty to support the child financially. Therefore, the answer would be A, he's in the wrong.\n"
