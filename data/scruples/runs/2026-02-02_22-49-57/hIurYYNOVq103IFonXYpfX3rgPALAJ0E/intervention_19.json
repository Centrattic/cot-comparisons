We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting a \"financial abortion.\" So first, I need to understand the situation.\n\nThe author was in a relationship that ended months ago. They were clear they didn't want kids. Now the ex is pregnant and wants him to take responsibility. He doesn't want to be involved, doesn't want child support, custody, etc. He's with a new partner and moved into a new place. His ex's friends are calling him selfish.\n\nSo, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Legally, in many places, fathers are required to pay child support, even if they don't want to be involved. But the author is looking for a way to disclaim all rights and responsibilities. That might not be possible legally. Let me check. In some jurisdictions, you can disavow paternity, but usually, if DNA tests confirm you're the father, you can't just walk away. The court might still require child support.\n\nMorally, it's tricky. Some people would say he's responsible for his actions, others might sympathize that he was clear about not wanting kids. But having said that, contributing to a child's life is part of being a father. But if he didn't consent to the pregnancy, maybe that's different. However, the argument is that he's responsible for the child he helped create, regardless of intent.\n\nThe ex is keeping the baby, which she has the right to do. The author can't force her to terminate. He's not in a position to dictate her choices. So he's left with the responsibility of financial support, even if he doesn't want it. \n\nHis new girlfriend might be affected by this too. If he's ordered to pay child support, it could impact their finances. But is it fair? Legally, maybe yes. Morally, opinions might vary. The author isn't the one who wanted to keep the child, but he is the biological father.\n\nSo the answer would depend on legal aspects and moral standpoint. The user says they think the author isn't in the wrong, but the answer options are A (yes) or B (no). Since the author is being asked if he's in the wrong, and given the legal obligations, maybe he's not in the wrong morally, but legally he might have to comply. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not legal obligations. So if the user is asking whether he's morally in the wrong, the answer might be B (no), because he's clear on not wanting kids, but legally he's in a tough spot.\n"
