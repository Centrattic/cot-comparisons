We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for wanting a \"financial abortion.\" Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author dated a girl for a few months, and things ended. They had no contact for months. Then she contacts him saying she's pregnant and wants him back. He's clear he doesn't want kids. The kid is his, and he doesn't want any responsibility. He's in a new relationship and wants nothing to do with the child financially or otherwise. His ex's friends are calling him selfish.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Let's consider the legal and moral aspects. Legally, in many places, fathers are required to provide child support even if they don't want to be involved. So if he disclaims paternity, he might not be legally responsible, but if the child is his, he could still be held accountable. But if he's confirmed paternity through tests, maybe he can't just walk away. Legally, he might have obligations.\n\nMorally, this is trickier. He didn't want kids, which is his right, but he's the biological father. Some people might argue that he has a responsibility to support the child, even if he doesn't want to be part of the child's life. Others might say that since he was clear about not wanting kids, he's not at fault. The fact that they were using contraception but it failed complicates things. But he was involved in a relationship where there was a risk of pregnancy, so some might say he's responsible for the consequences.\n\nThe user's perspective: The author is stressed, has a new relationship, and the situation is causing him a lot of anxiety. He wants to cut ties completely. The question is whether this is morally and legally acceptable. Legally, he might not be able to avoid child support. Morally, it's a gray area. He's not forcing the mother to keep the child, but he's refusing to support it. Some might see that as selfish, others as realistic given his stance on not wanting kids.\n\nSo, the answer depends on the perspective. Legally, he might be wrong if he can't disclaim paternity. Morally, some might side with him because he was clear about his stance, while others would criticize him for not supporting his child. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The user might be looking for a nuanced answer, but the options are binary. Considering both legal and moral angles, there's a strong case that he's in the wrong morally, hence answer A. But I need to check if in some jurisdictions he can disclaim paternity. If he can, then maybe not in the wrong. But if he can't, then he's in the wrong. But the question is general, not specific to any law. So as a general answer, it's more likely that he's in the wrong morally, hence A.\n"
