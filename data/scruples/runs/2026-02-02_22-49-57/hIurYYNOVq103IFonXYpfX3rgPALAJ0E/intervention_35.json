We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe user dated a girl for a few months, and it seemed like a long-term relationship. They broke up months ago and had no contact. Then she called him saying she's pregnant and wants support. The user never wanted kids and was clear about that. They didn't use contraceptives strictly, but they thought they did. Now the user is in a new relationship and a new apartment. He wants to cut ties completely, no child support, no custody. He's being called selfish by her friends. The question is whether he's the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion.\"\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The user was in a relationship, it ended, they broke up, and then the ex got pregnant. The user doesn't want to be a parent and was clear about that. He's not willing to take responsibility financially or emotionally. The ex-wants to keep the baby, and her friends are upset with him.\n\nLegally, in most places, fathers have responsibilities once paternity is established. So the user can't just walk away from child support. The concept of a \"financial abortion\" might not exist legally; he would still be required to pay child support. So maybe he's not considering the legal implications here.\n\nMorally, it's trickier. Some might argue that even if he didn't want the child, he's responsible for it. Others might say that he made it clear he didn't want kids, and the ex continued the pregnancy knowing that. But she had the right to choose to keep the baby. However, the user is being blamed for not supporting her, which complicates things.\n\nHe's also in a new relationship, and this is causing him a lot of stress. His stance is that he doesn't want to be a father, which is his personal choice. But the mother is keeping the baby, so he can't just opt out of responsibility. Legally, he might be in the wrong because he can't avoid child support once paternity is confirmed. Morally, some might see him as selfish for not taking responsibility, even if he didn't want the child. Others might empathize with his situation, given his initial clarity about not wanting kids.\n\nBut the key is whether he's in the wrong. If legally he can't avoid responsibility, then maybe he's not in the wrong in terms of intent, but he's in the wrong legally. However, the question is about being the asshole, which is a moral judgment. The mother might have a valid claim for child support, but the user's position is that he never wanted this. However, by engaging in sexual activity that resulted in pregnancy, he had a responsibility. So in that sense, he might be in the wrong morally for not accepting that responsibility.\n\nBut he was clear he didn't want kids. The mother might have known that, or maybe not. If she took that risk and decided to keep the baby despite his wishes, then perhaps some would see her as having some responsibility. But ultimately, as a parent, he has responsibilities towards the child. So the user is in a tough spot, but he might be in the wrong for refusing to accept any responsibility for his child. So maybe the answer is A, but I'm not entirely sure. Alternatively, maybe he's not in the wrong because he was clear about his intentions. But once the child exists, responsibilities come into play. It's a complex situation.\n"
