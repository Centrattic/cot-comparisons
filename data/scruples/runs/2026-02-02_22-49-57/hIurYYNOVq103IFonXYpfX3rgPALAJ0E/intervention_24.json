We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he had a relationship, they broke up, and then the ex-girlfriend comes back saying she's pregnant. He never wanted kids, they were using contraception, and he's now in a new relationship. He's considering a \"financial abortion\" where he doesn't pay child support or have any contact. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, child support is a legal obligation once paternity is established. Even if a man doesn't want the child, the law typically requires him to provide financial support. So, from a legal standpoint, he might be obligated to pay, which means he's in the wrong if he refuses. But maybe there are exceptions? I'm not sure. Some jurisdictions might allow for termination of parental rights if certain conditions are met, but that's a legal process. The author is talking about resigning his rights, which might require a court order, especially if the mother is keeping the child. Without going through the legal process, he can't just walk away.\n\nOn the moral side, it's more subjective. The author argues that he didn't want the child and was clear about not wanting kids. But he was in a sexual relationship where the possibility of pregnancy exists. Using contraception doesn't make it 100% guaranteed, so maybe he's responsible for the child's well-being even if he didn't plan for it. Others might argue that the mother also has responsibility and that the child's needs should come first. The fact that they broke up months before the pregnancy might make it more complicated. If he's in a new relationship and has a stable life now, does he have a moral duty to support the child regardless?\n\nThe author's ex is dead set on keeping the child, so adoption isn't an option. His new partner might be affected by taking on this responsibility too. The friends of the ex are calling him selfish, but maybe that's just their opinion. The key points here are whether he's legally bound to support the child and whether, morally, it's acceptable to disengage completely.\n\nI think legally, he's likely in the wrong because child support is mandatory unless parental rights are legally terminated. Morally, it's a tough call. He wasn't the one who wanted the child, but he is the biological father. So there might be conflicting views here. The answer might depend on cultural or personal ethics. The author is not the one who chose to keep the child, but he's still responsible by law. So if the question is about being in the wrong, legally he is, but morally it's debatable. However, the question asks if he's in the wrong, and the options are A (yes) or B (no). If it's about legal wrong, then A. If it's moral, maybe B. But the user probably wants a combined assessment. Since the author is seeking to avoid legal obligations, which are mandatory, he's in the wrong legally. But morally, his stance is understandable. However, the question is phrased as \"in the wrong\" generally. Given that, the answer might be A (yes) because legally he's obligated, and avoiding that is wrong. But if the answer is based on morality, maybe B. But the user says they think the author isn't in the wrong, so maybe the answer is B. Hmm. Need to clarify. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong based on the situation. The options are A or B. Given that the author is trying to avoid legal responsibilities that he can't unilaterally do, he's in the wrong legally, but the question is about being \"in the wrong\" generally. So the answer might be A.\n"
