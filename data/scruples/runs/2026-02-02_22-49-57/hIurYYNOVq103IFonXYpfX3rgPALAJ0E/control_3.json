We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation involves an unexpected pregnancy after a breakup.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, fathers are legally responsible for child support even if they didn't want the child. So, wanting to disclaim all responsibility might not be legally possible. But the user is asking if it's morally and legally okay. Legally, maybe not. Morally, it's a tricky area.\n\nThe user doesn't want kids and was clear about that. However, the pregnancy happened despite contraceptive use. The ex wants to keep the child, and the father is now in a new relationship. The ex's friends are calling him selfish. \n\nMoral responsibility is another angle. Even if he didn't want the child, some might argue that being a responsible father is necessary. Others might say that since it wasn't his intention, he shouldn't be forced into parenthood. However, there's a difference between not wanting the child and refusing all responsibility. \n\nThe key points are: clarity about not wanting kids, the unexpected pregnancy, legal obligations, and the impact on both the mother and the potential child. The user is seeking to disengage completely, which might be seen as selfish by some but understandable given their stance. \n\nI need to balance legal and moral perspectives. Legally, he might have obligations regardless. Morally, people might have differing opinions. The answer hinges on whether the user's actions are seen as responsible or avoiding responsibility. The answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because, despite the circumstances, he might still have a legal and moral duty to support the child, even if he doesn't want to be involved. However, some might argue B (not in the wrong) based on his clear prior stance against children. But typically, in such situations, the expectation is that fathers take responsibility, so A might be the more common answer.\n"
