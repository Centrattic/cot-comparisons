We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he dated a girl, broke up, then she got pregnant and wants him involved. He never wanted kids, they used contraceptives, and now he's refusing any responsibility. His new girlfriend and new apartment are mentioned, and he's really stressed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most places, if you're the biological father, you're automatically a legal parent, right? Even if you don't want to be involved, you might still have to pay child support. So if he disclaims paternity, he might not have to pay, but that's a legal process. But maybe she can challenge that if she doesn't agree. So legally, he might be on shaky ground if he just refuses without going through proper channels.\n\nThen there's the moral side. He didn't want kids, they broke up, and she got pregnant. But she's keeping the baby, and he's not willing to help. Some might say he's responsible because he was part of the act that led to the pregnancy. Others might argue that since he was clear about not wanting kids and they were using contraception, it's not his fault. But once the baby is born, he's a father, and some would say he has a duty to support his child, regardless of his initial wishes.\n\nAlso, the fact that they broke up months before the pregnancy could be a point. If he's not in a relationship with the mother anymore, maybe he didn't expect to be a father. But the responsibility of parenthood isn't always dependent on the relationship status. Even if the parents aren't together, the child has rights.\n\nHer friends are calling him selfish, which might be their perspective, but he's dealing with a significant life change. The emotional impact on both sides is complex. He might feel forced into a role he never wanted, but the mother is choosing to parent, and he's the biological father.\n\nLegally, in many jurisdictions, you can't just opt out of child support. You might have to go to court, and even then, if paternity is established, you might be required to pay unless the court agrees to terminate parental rights, which is a big deal and usually requires showing that it's in the child's best interest or some other compelling reason.\n\nMoral arguments could go either way. Some people believe that once a child exists, the parent has a responsibility. Others might say that if both parties were careful and he was clear about his intentions, he's not at fault. But there's also the idea that creating life comes with responsibilities, even if unintended.\n\nI think the key points are legal obligations versus personal choice. Legally, he might be in the wrong if he doesn't go through the proper steps to disclaim paternity, but if he does, maybe he can avoid support. Morally, it's more subjective. Some might see him as avoiding responsibility, others as standing by his original wishes.\n\nIn the end, whether he's in the wrong depends on the legal system's stance and societal moral views. But since the question is about being in the wrong, and considering both legal and moral aspects, I think the answer might be a mix. However, since the user is asking if he's in the wrong, and given the context, the answer could swing either way. But I need to pick A or B. If I had to choose, maybe B (not in the wrong) because he was clear about not wanting kids, but maybe I'm overlooking something.\n"
