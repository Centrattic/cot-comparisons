We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a man who had a past relationship, broke up, and now the ex is pregnant. He never wanted kids and is against being a father. He doesn't want to be involved financially or emotionally. The question is whether he's the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion,\" which means cutting off all responsibility.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most places, once a child is born, the legal father is responsible for child support regardless of the circumstances. Even if the father didn't want the child, he might still have legal obligations. So if he wants to cut off all support, that could be legally problematic. The mother can go to court to enforce child support. So legally, he might be in the wrong if he refuses.\n\nMorally, this is trickier. Some people might argue that he's being selfish by not taking responsibility for a child he helped create. Others might say that since he made his stance clear and the mother chose to keep the child despite knowing his position, he's not entirely to blame. But then again, contributing to the child's well-being is often seen as a moral responsibility, even if it's not one's fault the child exists.\n\nThe ex's friends are calling him selfish, which adds social pressure. Emotionally, he's dealing with a lot of stress, but that doesn't negate the responsibilities he might have. The mother might be in a tough spot too, but the father's obligation is often seen as non-negotiable once paternity is established.\n\nAlso, the fact that they were using contraceptives but it still happened doesn't let him off the hook. Accidents happen, but that doesn't mean he isn't responsible now. The key point is that he's trying to avoid all responsibility, which is both legally and morally questionable.\n\nSo putting it all together, the answer is likely that he's in the wrong (A). He has legal obligations as the father and moral responsibilities, so wanting to completely disengage isn't acceptable.\n"
