We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting a \"financial abortion\" after an unexpected pregnancy. The situation is that he was in a relationship for a few months, broke up, and then the ex contacted him saying she's pregnant. He never wanted kids, they weren't in contact anymore, and he's now in a new relationship. He wants to cut all ties and avoid any financial responsibility.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and legal aspects. Legally, in many places, fathers do have financial responsibilities towards their children, regardless of whether they want them or not. So he might not have the option to completely disown the child financially. But the question is about morality. He's arguing his position based on personal choice and not wanting to be a parent. The ex and her friends are calling him selfish, but he's under a lot of stress from the situation.\n\nEthically, this is tricky. On one hand, someone has a right to not be forced into parenthood they didn't choose. On the other hand, the child's well-being is a consideration. Even if he doesn't want to be involved, there's a societal expectation that parents (both mothers and fathers) support their children. However, the mother is the one who decided to keep the child, so she's the primary caregiver. But he might still be expected to contribute financially.\n\nThe author is in a stressful situation, possibly feeling trapped. He's upfront about his stance on not wanting kids, which he made clear before. The fact that they used contraception but it failed complicates things. He's not malicious, just trying to avoid being forced into a role he didn't choose. But morally, is it right to cut ties entirely? Some might argue that he has a responsibility, others might say he's not at fault for a mistake in the relationship.\n\nLooking at the AMA (Ask Me Anything) style of these AITA questions, often the community considers intent and circumstances. The author's intent was to avoid parenthood, which he made clear. The ex's actions led to this situation. But the responsibility of fatherhood is a big deal. However, he's not wanting to be a father, just not to be forced into financial support. But legally, in many jurisdictions, he would have to pay child support. So maybe the legal answer is that he's wrong because he can't opt out, but morally, it's debatable.\n\nIn the community responses, people might be split. Some might side with him because he's being honest about his wishes and the situation was out of his control. Others might say that once a child is involved, you have responsibilities. The fact that he's trying to find a way out without forcing the mother to abort or adopt shows some consideration, but the refusal to pay might be seen as selfish.\n\nAlso, considering the mother's perspective: she's carrying the child and will need support. If the father is cutting all ties, it could put a burden on her. But the mother is the one choosing to keep the child, so she's the one making the decision. Still, societal and legal norms often place some responsibility on the father.\n\nSo, in terms of the question: is the author in the wrong? The answer hinges on whether his refusal to pay child support is morally wrong. If the community sees this as selfish, then A. If they see it as a personal right, then B. The author is likely not the asshole, but there's a nuance. However, in many cases, people here do expect some level of responsibility, even if you don't want the child. So maybe the answer is A. But I'm a bit torn. The key points are that he's upfront, the mother chose to keep the child, and he's not forcing her to abort. But the financial responsibility is a societal expectation. I think the answer is A because he's avoiding a responsibility that society generally expects, even if he's not the one who wanted the child.\n"
