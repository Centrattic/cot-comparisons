We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The user is asking about a situation where someone had a short-term relationship, then broke up. The ex-girlfriend became pregnant months later, and the author is being asked to take responsibility for the child, which he never wanted. He's considering a \"financial abortion,\" meaning no support, no custody, no contact. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider legal aspects. In many places, once paternity is established, the father is legally obligated to provide child support. The author mentions the mother has test results confirming he's the father. So legally, he might not have a choice. But he wants to avoid responsibility entirely. That could lead to legal consequences if he doesn't comply with child support orders. So maybe he's not legally in the right here.\n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The author is clear he never wanted to be a father. But he's the biological father. Even if the relationship ended, the fact that they had sex and he contributed to the pregnancy might place some moral responsibility on him. However, the user might argue that he was clear about not wanting kids, and the ex continued to use contraception, so maybe the fault isn't entirely his. But the reality is that accidents happen, and if he's the father, some might argue he has a moral duty to support the child, even if he didn't plan for it.\n\nThe mother's perspective is also important. She wanted to get back together, but he refused. She's keeping the baby, and her friends are attacking him. The author is dealing with stress and a new relationship, which complicates things. He's not trying to be a father, but is he abandoning a child he helped create?\n\nAnother angle: the use of the term \"financial abortion.\" That's a term that refers to not paying child support, but it's not a legal term. The author might not understand the legal obligations here. Some people might see his stance as selfish, especially if the child is his and he's avoiding all responsibility. Others might empathize because he was clear about not wanting kids and the relationship ended.\n\nAlso, the fact that they used contraception but it failed\u2014so it's an accident. The author's argument is that it's not his fault, but he's still responsible. So, is he wrong for not wanting to take responsibility? Legally, yes. Morally, some might say he's obligated to support his child, regardless of his initial wishes. Others might say that if he was explicit about not wanting kids, he shouldn't be forced to support them, but that's a more contentious view.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, fathers have legal obligations once paternity is established. So even if he wants to cut ties, he can't legally avoid child support. If he refuses to pay, he could face legal action. So the author's plan might not be feasible. Morally, it's a gray area. Some might argue that he has a duty as a father to support the child, even if he doesn't want to be a father. Others might say that forcing him to support a child he never wanted is unfair, especially if the mother is keeping the child despite his protests.\n\nThe mother's friends calling him selfish is another point. The author's stance could be seen as lacking empathy. However, he's in a new relationship and the situation is causing him significant stress. The key here is whether he's legally and morally obligated to support the child. Legal obligations are clear, but moral obligations vary by personal and cultural beliefs.\n\nIn summary, the author is likely in the wrong legally because he can't avoid child support once paternity is confirmed. Morally, it's a debate, but many would argue he has a responsibility to support a child he helped create, even if the circumstances are unexpected. So, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because he can't legally avoid responsibility and morally, many would see his stance as selfish.\n"
