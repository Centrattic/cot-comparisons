We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he was in a relationship that ended, and then after some time, the ex contacts him saying she's pregnant. He made it clear he doesn't want kids, so he's not happy about this. He doesn't want to take responsibility, which is what's causing the conflict.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the legal aspect. I remember that in many places, fathers have legal responsibilities towards their children, even if the mother doesn't want them involved. So he can't just completely cut off all responsibilities. Maybe he can't get a \"financial abortion,\" which he's referring to as not paying child support, no custody, etc. Legally, he might still have to pay child support even if he doesn't want to.\n\nThen there's the moral side. People might argue that he's being selfish by not wanting to take responsibility for his child. But others might say that he was clear about not wanting kids, and maybe the mother should have considered that before getting pregnant. However, if they were in a relationship, even if it ended, there's an argument that he's responsible now. Also, the fact that they had some contraceptive measures but it failed might not absolve him of responsibility.\n\nHe also has a new girlfriend and a new apartment, so he's trying to build a new life. But the mother is insisting on keeping the child, and he doesn't want to be involved. His friends are calling him selfish, which adds to the social pressure. \n\nI should check if there's a legal way for him to disclaim paternity. From what I know, in some places, a man can disclaim paternity if he wasn't married to the mother at the time, but once paternity is established, it's hard to walk away from the legal responsibilities. So he can't just opt out of being a father legally. That might mean his plan isn't feasible, making him in the wrong if he's trying to avoid responsibilities he can't legally avoid.\n\nOn the moral side, even if he's not the financial asshole, maybe he's being a moral one by not supporting his child. But if he was explicit about not wanting kids, is that on him? Or does the mother have a responsibility to consider that? It's a bit of a gray area. However, once the child is born, the argument for responsibility is stronger.\n\nSo putting it all together, legally he might not have a choice but to pay child support, so trying to avoid that could make him the asshole. Morally, it's complicated, but many people would say he has a responsibility to his child despite his personal wishes. Therefore, he's at least partially in the wrong.\n"
