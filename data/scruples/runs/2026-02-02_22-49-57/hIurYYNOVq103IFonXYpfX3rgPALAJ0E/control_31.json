We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who had a relationship, broke up, then found out his ex is pregnant and wants him to be involved. He doesn't want kids, is in a new relationship, and wants to cut off all financial responsibility. He's being called selfish by her friends.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In many places, child support is a legal requirement regardless of the parent's consent. So if the child is his, he might be legally obligated to provide support. So he can't just disown the child financially. That's a key point.\n\nThen the moral side. Does he have a moral responsibility? Even if he didn't want children, he's a parent now. Some might argue he's responsible for contributing since his actions led to the pregnancy. Others might say he's entitled to not be forced into parenthood against his will. But it's complicated because the child is innocent.\n\nHe's also in a new relationship and moving into a new apartment. His stress and fear of being a father are valid emotions. But the mother is choosing to keep the child, so he can't force an abortion. The mother's perspective is important here too. She might feel he's abandoning her and the child.\n\nThe guy's refusal to have contact or pay support is a problem legally, but morally, there's debate. However, most societies expect parents to support their children, regardless of the circumstances. So he might be in the wrong morally too.\n\nHer friends calling him selfish could have some merit if he's not taking responsibility. But he's also in a tough spot. However, the answer hinges on whether he can legally and morally disengage. Since he can't legally, and morally there's an expectation to support the child, he might be in the wrong. So the answer is probably A.\n"
