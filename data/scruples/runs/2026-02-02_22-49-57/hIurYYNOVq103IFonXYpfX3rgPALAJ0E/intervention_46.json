We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again.\n\nThe person dated a girl for a few months, and things were looking like a long-term relationship. Then they had a breakup and no contact for months. After that, the ex contacts them saying she's pregnant and wants support. The author was clear they never wanted kids, so this came as a shock. They rejected getting back together and hung up. The ex is keeping the baby, and the author wants to disavow any financial responsibility, hence the \"financial abortion.\" They're in a new relationship and moving into a new apartment, and this situation is causing them a lot of stress. The ex's friends are calling the author selfish.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks they aren't, but I need to weigh in.\n\nFirst, let's consider the legal aspect. In many places, if you are the biological father, you can be required to pay child support even if you don't want to be involved. However, if the parent voluntarily disavows paternity and the mother doesn't want you involved, there might be legal steps to do that. But I think in most jurisdictions, once paternity is established, you can't just opt out of financial responsibility without legal consequences. The author might have to go through a legal process to terminate parental rights, which is not straightforward and usually requires showing that it's in the child's best interest.\n\nMoral aspect: The author is clear they don't want to be a parent and are against being financially responsible. But from a moral standpoint, some might argue that you have a responsibility to a child you've created, regardless of the circumstances. Others might say that if both parties used contraception and the pregnancy was a mistake, the father shouldn't be forced to support it. However, the author's stance is that they never wanted kids, so they're not at fault for the unintended pregnancy. The ex's friends are calling them selfish, which could be valid if the author is avoiding responsibility without considering the child's well-being. But if the mother is keeping the baby and the father is not being forced to take custody, maybe the author's position is more about personal choice and responsibility.\n\nAnother angle: The author and ex had a breakup and no contact. The ex then got pregnant. If they were using contraception, maybe there was a failure, but both parties have responsibility. However, once the pregnancy is confirmed, the father's rights and responsibilities might still come into play. The author's immediate reaction was to reject any involvement, which could be seen as abandoning responsibility, but if they never wanted children, it's a personal choice they have to live with.\n\nIn terms of being an asshole, the author is not forcing the ex to terminate the pregnancy. They're just refusing to be involved financially or emotionally. The ex's friends might see this as selfish, but depending on the legal framework, the author might have the right to not pay if they can legally disavow parentage. However, if paternity is established, they might have no choice. So the author's actions could be legally questionable, but morally, it's a gray area. Some might say you have a duty to a child you helped create, even unintentionally. Others might say consent to parenthood is crucial, and without it, the father shouldn't be forced to take on that role.\n\nSo considering all that, the author's stance isn't necessarily morally wrong if they didn't consent to parenthood and the mother is choosing to parent alone. But legally, they might be required to support the child. The question is whether they're in the wrong morally, which is subjective. The user thinks they're not, and I might lean that way, but there's a strong argument that the author is avoiding responsibility. However, given the circumstances of the breakup and the lack of contact, maybe the author isn't at fault. So I think the answer would be B, No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
