We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a man who had a brief relationship that ended months ago, and now his ex is pregnant. He never wanted kids, they broke up, and he refuses to have any contact, pay child support, or take any responsibility. He's considering a \"financial abortion\" by disengaging from the child's life.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, when a child is born and the father is identified, he is legally obligated to provide financial support, even if he's not involved in the child's life. So from a legal standpoint, refusing child support might not be okay. The man might have to pay regardless of his personal feelings. That's a key point because if he goes against the law, he's in the wrong in a legal sense, even if others might understand his feelings.\n\nThen there's the moral angle. People might argue that a child's well-being is important, and a father has a responsibility, even if the relationship was brief. Others might say that if the father was clear about not wanting kids and the mother made the decision to keep the child, he shouldn't be forced to support it. However, the mother's friends are calling him selfish, which suggests some societal judgment. But does that mean he's morally in the wrong? It's debatable. He's choosing to walk away, which some might see as selfish, but others might empathize with his stance given his prior clarity.\n\nThe user also mentioned the mother is \"dead set on keeping it,\" and he doesn't want to be a father. The question is about whether he's in the wrong for wanting to disengage. Legally, he might not have the option to disclaim responsibility if he's the biological father. Morally, some people might think that once a child is born, the father has a duty, while others might respect his right to choose not to be involved, especially if the pregnancy was a surprise and they had been using contraception.\n\nBut wait, the father's responsibility usually doesn't end with the child's birth. Even if he doesn't want to be involved, the law typically requires support. So if he refuses to pay, that's illegal. The mother could take legal action. So legally, he's in the wrong. Morally, some might argue that he's being realistic about his own desires, but others might see it as abandoning responsibility.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The answer hinges on whether the law requires financial support regardless of the father's consent. If so, then he's in the wrong legally. Morally, it's more subjective. However, the question is whether he's \"in the wrong,\" which could mean both legal and moral. Since the law likely obligates him, the answer is probably A. But maybe there's a nuance. For example, if the pregnancy was a result of the mother's actions after the breakup, could he be absolved? Probably not, because once he's the biological father, the legal responsibility usually follows. So the author is in the wrong both legally and morally in many people's eyes.\n"
