We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting a \"financial abortion,\" which essentially means not providing support for the child they didn't plan to have. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author had a relationship that ended months before the pregnancy was discovered. They were clear about not wanting kids. The breakup was mutual and they had no contact. The ex approached the author with the pregnancy, and he immediately refused to get back together, shutting down any idea of parenting.\n\nLegally, in many places, fathers do have responsibilities once paternity is established. Even if the father doesn't want the child, he might be required to pay child support. However, the author wants to resign all rights and responsibilities, which might not be possible without the mother's consent. Legally, there's usually a process for terminating parental rights, which can be complex and requires court approval, especially if the mother is not in agreement.\n\nMoral arguments are more subjective. The author feels it's not his fault and that he's being selfish because he never wanted kids. On the other hand, some might argue that he has a responsibility since he's the father. The mother, however, chose to keep the child and didn't seek an abortion, which could factor into the moral equation. The author is not trying to prevent the pregnancy from continuing, which is a key point\u2014since he's not advocating for an abortion, but rather not being involved financially or otherwise.\n\nThe mother's friends are calling him selfish, but if the author had no prior indication she was planning to keep the baby and didn't know about the pregnancy until months after the breakup, his response might be seen as a reaction to a surprise situation. The fact that they used contraception and it failed complicates things; maybe the author feels it's beyond his control.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is trying to set boundaries to protect his current relationship and new living situation. However, legally and socially, there's often an expectation that fathers contribute. Without knowing the specific laws of the jurisdiction, it's hard to say if he can completely opt out. But morally, there's debate\u2014some might side with the author given the circumstances, others might hold him responsible regardless.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer might depend on legal context, but morally, it's a gray area. However, since the user's question is about whether the author is in the wrong, the answer would likely lean towards \"No\" because he's not forcing the mother to get an abortion and is upfront about his stance, even if he's legally obligated. The key points are his lack of prior knowledge, clear communication of not wanting kids, and not attempting to prevent the pregnancy or the child's birth, which some might see as him not being in the wrong morally.\n"
