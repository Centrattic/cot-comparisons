We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this query. So, the user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a man who had a brief relationship that ended, then found out the ex-girlfriend is pregnant. He never wanted kids and wants to avoid any financial responsibility, hence the term \"financial abortion.\" The user wants to know if he's the asshole here (AITA), so I need to evaluate from both moral and legal angles.\n\nFirst, I should consider the legal aspects. In most jurisdictions, when a child is born, the father has legal responsibilities, including child support. Even if the father doesn't want to be involved, the law typically requires him to provide financial support. So, trying to renounce all rights and responsibilities might not be legally feasible. The author might not have the legal right to disclaim paternity if it's confirmed, unless there are specific legal avenues, which vary by country or state.\n\nMoral-wise, this is trickier. The man claims he never wanted children, which is a valid personal choice. However, bringing a child into the world and then not supporting it raises ethical questions. The mother chose to keep the child, so the father's refusal to support might be seen as abandoning responsibility. But he also argues that he's in a new relationship and moving on, which complicates things. People have the right to make their own choices, but when it affects others, especially a child, society often expects some level of responsibility.\n\nThere's also the aspect of the mother's well-being. Her friends are upset, calling him selfish. If he cuts off all contact and refuses support, that could impact her ability to raise the child. However, if the father isn't involved, maybe that's better for the child if he's not supportive. But again, the child's needs versus the father's wishes are a moral dilemma.\n\nI should also think about consent and responsibility. Even if they were using contraception, accidents happen. The father didn't consent to the pregnancy, but once the child is born, he has a paternal responsibility. The concept of a \"financial abortion\" isn't a recognized legal term, so he might not be able to legally avoid support. Morally, some might argue that he's selfish for not supporting a child he's biologically related to, while others might respect his right to not become a parent.\n\nIn conclusion, legally, he's probably not able to avoid financial support. Morally, opinions are divided, but many would likely side with the idea that he's responsible for his child. So, the answer would be that he's in the wrong (A) because he's avoiding a responsibility he has, both legally and ethically. Even if he didn't want the child, once it's born, he has obligations.\n"
