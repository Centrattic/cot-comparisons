We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the person in this situation is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the details again to make sure I understand everything.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is the asshole (AITA) for wanting a \"financial abortion.\" The situation is that he dated a girl for a few months, things looked like they could be long-term, but then they broke up and had no contact for months. She then contacted him saying she was pregnant, a few months along. He was clear he never wanted kids. He refused to get back together and wants nothing to do with the child\u2014no contact, no child support, etc. His current girlfriend is with him, and they moved into a new apartment. He's freaked out and searching for ways to avoid responsibility. Her friends are calling him selfish for not supporting her. He's asking if he's the asshole for wanting to disengage completely.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, fathers have legal responsibilities once paternity is established. Even if the child isn't born yet, once it's confirmed he's the father, he might be obligated to pay child support. So legally, he might not have a choice. But the question is about morality and whether he's in the wrong, not just legalities.\n\nMorally, it's more complex. The user argues he never wanted kids, was clear about that, and the breakup was months prior. The mother continued the pregnancy despite his stance. The fact that they used contraception but it failed is a point\u2014maybe they both thought the risk was low. But she went ahead with the pregnancy. Now he's being asked to support a child he never wanted. On the other hand, she's carrying the child to term and wants his support.\n\nThe user says he's not being selfish, but others are calling him that. The user's side is that he's not in the wrong because he made his stance clear and the pregnancy wasn't planned. The mother's side is that she's making a choice to have the child and he has responsibilities. \n\nI need to think about consent. Did they both have the choice to use contraception, or was there a failure? They were \"fairly strict\" but it still failed. So maybe both share some responsibility. However, once the child is conceived, the father's responsibility is a point of contention.\n\nIn terms of moral responsibility, some might say that even if you don't want kids, becoming a parent is a responsibility you have to accept if you're part of the conception. Others might argue that if both parties used contraception and it failed, it's not entirely either person's fault, and the mother's decision to continue the pregnancy without considering the father's wishes is the issue. \n\nThe author is trying to disengage completely, which could be seen as selfish because the child exists now, and he's a biological parent. But he's also clear that he never wanted kids, which is a personal choice. However, once a child is born, there's a societal expectation that the father will contribute. So there's a conflict between personal choice and societal/moral obligations.\n\nLegally, in many jurisdictions, the father can't just disown the child. He might have to pay child support unless there are extenuating circumstances. So legally, he might be in a tight spot, but morally, it's a gray area. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong (A or B). The user says they think the author is not in the wrong. I need to consider both perspectives.\n\nFrom the author's perspective: He made his stance clear, didn't want kids, breakup occurred, and now is faced with an unexpected situation. He's trying to protect his current life with his new girlfriend. He's stressed and wants to avoid responsibility. \n\nFrom the other side: The mother is carrying the child and expects support. The author might be seen as not standing by his responsibilities, even if he didn't plan for this. \n\nI think there's a lot of nuance here. The key points are whether the author is being selfish by not supporting a child he helped create, even if he didn't plan to. But he was clear about his stance, and the mother proceeded despite that. However, once the child is born, some might argue he has responsibilities regardless of his initial wishes. \n\nSo, is he in the wrong? If the mother chose to continue the pregnancy after the breakup and despite his clear stance, maybe she shares some responsibility. But the author is being blamed for not supporting her. \n\nIn terms of the answer, the user says they think the author is not in the wrong. Considering all that, I might lean towards B (No, not in the wrong) because he was clear about his intentions, the pregnancy wasn't planned despite precautions, and the mother chose to continue. However, others might argue he still has responsibilities. But given the details, maybe B is the right choice here.\n"
