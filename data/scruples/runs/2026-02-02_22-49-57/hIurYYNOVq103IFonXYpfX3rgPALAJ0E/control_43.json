We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the given story is in the wrong for wanting a \"financial abortion,\" which essentially means they don't want any responsibility for the child, including child support, custody, or contact.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most jurisdictions, when a man is determined to be the legal father of a child, he is required to provide financial support, even if he doesn't want to be involved. Denying paternity is possible, but if tests confirm it's his child, he can't just walk away. The concept of a \"financial abortion\" isn't a legal term I'm familiar with, so maybe the author is misunderstanding the law here. Legally, he might be obligated to pay child support, and trying to avoid that could lead to legal consequences.\n\nThen there's the moral angle. The author is clear that he doesn't want kids, but he was in a relationship where they were using contraceptives. The question is whether he's responsible for the pregnancy. However, since the pregnancy happened despite precautions, some might argue he's still responsible for contributing to the child's upbringing. Others might say that if both parties used contraception correctly, the mother should take responsibility, but if there was a failure in the method, both might share responsibility. But in this case, the author is taking a firm stance that he never wants to be a father and is trying to distance himself completely.\n\nEmotionally, the author is in a lot of stress, moving in with his new girlfriend and dealing with unexpected news. His new girlfriend's support would also be a factor here. The mother's friends are calling him selfish, which adds to the conflict. The mother's actions post-breakup\u2014waiting months before contacting him\u2014might also be seen as contributing to the confusion and stress.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, some might argue that as a father (biologically), he has a duty to support the child, even if he doesn't want to be a part of the child's life. Others might say that if the parents aren't together and the father never wanted children, it's unfair to force him to bear financial responsibility. It's a complex issue with no clear right or wrong answer, but in many places, the law prioritizes the child's best interest, which often includes financial support from both parents.\n\nSo, putting this together: legally, the author might not be able to avoid child support if paternity is confirmed. Morally, opinions are divided, but wanting to avoid all responsibility could be seen as selfish. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because, despite his feelings, he may have legal obligations and moral responsibilities he can't just walk away from. However, the situation is nuanced, and there are arguments both ways. But given the options, the likely answer is A.\n"
