We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves an unexpected pregnancy from a past relationship, and the author wants to disengage completely financially and otherwise.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most places, fathers do have legal responsibilities to their children, including child support, even if they aren't involved. So if the author disclaims paternity, that might not be legally possible once paternity is established. So legally, they might be required to pay child support regardless of their feelings.\n\nMoral standpoint is trickier. The author never wanted kids, and they broke up months before the pregnancy. The mother kept the child, so the argument is whether the father is responsible. Some people might say that once a child is involved, the father has a moral duty, while others might agree that the father has the right to disengage if he wasn't involved.\n\nThe author's new GF and their new apartment are mentioned, which shows their life has moved on. They're overwhelmed and don't want to take on the responsibility. The mother and her friends are upset, which adds to the emotional tension.\n\nI should consider if the author is being selfish. They aren't trying to avoid responsibility if they can't disclaim paternity, but rather seeking a way out. However, legally they might not have that option. Also, the author's refusal to acknowledge the child could be seen as harming both the mother and the child, which might make them the asshole in some people's eyes.\n\nBut if they are legally required to pay, then their stance might not be feasible. The key points are the legal obligations versus personal choice. The mother did say she wanted to keep the child, so the author can't force an abortion. The question is whether wanting to disengage is morally acceptable.\n\nIn terms of traditional views, many would say that a father has responsibilities regardless of the circumstances. However, others might argue that if the father never had a relationship with the mother and wasn't part of the decision to have the child, he shouldn't be forced into parenthood. But the line between legal and moral is important here.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the author is in the wrong morally. Some might argue yes because they're avoiding responsibility, others might say no because they were clear about not wanting kids and the mother chose to keep it. Legally, they might be stuck paying. However, the question is about being in the wrong, which is more subjective.\n\nIn the AITA context, the community often considers intent and circumstances. The author was clear about not wanting kids, the breakup happened, and the pregnancy was unexpected. However, some might see the refusal to pay as selfish. The mother's friends are upset, which could indicate that the author's actions are causing harm. \n\nConsidering all angles, the answer might lean towards \"A\" (yes, the author is in the wrong) because once a child is born, legal and moral duties are typically considered to apply regardless of prior intentions. However, others might side with \"B\" (not in the wrong) if they believe individuals should have the right to opt out of parenthood if they never intended to have children. But given the legal obligations and the impact on the mother and child, the more common response might be \"A\".\n"
