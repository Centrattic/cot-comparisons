We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question step by step. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a man who had a relationship that ended, and then later found out the ex-girlfriend is pregnant. He never wanted kids, is in a new relationship, and wants to disassociate himself completely from the child, including financially.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, fathers have legal responsibilities once paternity is established. Even if the father doesn't want custody or contact, he's usually required to provide child support. The concept of a \"financial abortion\" isn't a recognized legal term, but the man is looking for a way to opt out of financial responsibility. However, legally, he might not have the option to disclaim paternity if it's confirmed, especially if the mother doesn't agree.\n\nMoral considerations are subjective. From his perspective, he didn't plan for this and is in a new relationship. He might feel that forcing him to support a child he never wanted is unfair. On the other hand, the mother has the right to raise her child, and the child has a right to support from both parents. Ethically, some might argue that the father has a moral obligation to support the child, regardless of his personal desires.\n\nThe mother's friends are calling him selfish, which adds social pressure. But the man's stance is that he's not being selfish; he's being honest about his limitations. However, refusing financial support could be seen as abandoning responsibility.\n\nI should also consider the circumstances of the pregnancy. They were using contraception, but accidents happen. The breakup was months prior, and communication ceased. Was there any discussion about future plans regarding children? The man was clear he didn't want kids, but maybe the mother assumed they might have a different timeline.\n\nLegally, if paternity is established, the father can't avoid child support. Morally, opinions might differ. Some might side with the father for not wanting a child, others with the mother needing support. The key points are the legal obligations versus personal choices. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, legally he might be required to pay, but morally, it's a gray area. However, in many places, he can't legally opt out, so his desire for a \"financial abortion\" might not be feasible, making him possibly at fault for not fulfilling his legal duties.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong) because legally he has responsibilities he's trying to avoid, even if morally it's debated. But I need to confirm if the laws in most jurisdictions require child support regardless of the father's wishes. If the law mandates support, then his stance is not legally viable, which could mean he's in the wrong for not accepting that responsibility.\n"
