We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to avoid financial responsibility for a child they didn't want. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author was in a relationship that ended a few months ago. They were clear about not wanting kids. Then the ex contacts them saying she's pregnant. The author is shocked and refuses to get back together, stating they don't want to be a parent. Now, the author wants to completely cut ties, no child support, no custody, and is looking into a \"financial abortion.\" The ex's friends are calling the author selfish and hurtful.\n\nLegally, in many places, fathers are required to provide financial support for their children regardless of their willingness. So the author can't just opt out of child support. Morally, it's a tricky area. The author didn't want kids, and the pregnancy happened despite precautions. But they are a biological parent, so there's an argument that they have some responsibility. However, they were clear about not wanting children, so maybe they aren't at fault for the pregnancy. \n\nBut the author is now trying to avoid all responsibilities, which could be seen as selfish. On the other hand, they are in a new relationship and moving to a new apartment, which might affect their stability if they take on child support. \n\nThe key points: The author was explicit about not wanting kids, the pregnancy happened despite precautions, but now they want no responsibility. Legally, they can't avoid child support. Morally, some might say they're being responsible by not wanting to be a parent, others might say they have a duty. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the answer is A (yes), it's because they should take responsibility. If B (no), it's because they were clear and shouldn't be forced into parenthood. I think it's a mix, but since the law requires support, and morally some might see it as selfish to avoid it, the answer might be A. But others might argue B. Hmm.\n"
