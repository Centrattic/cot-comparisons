We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting a \"financial abortion,\" which I think means not wanting to have any responsibility for the child, like no child support or contact. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most places, if a man is found to be the legal father, he's usually required to pay child support, right? Even if the parents aren't in a relationship anymore. So the author's desire to avoid that might not be legally possible. But maybe there are ways to terminate parental rights, which is a complex legal process. I'm not sure how that works, but it's probably not as simple as just saying \"no\" and walking away.\n\nThen there's the moral side. The author clearly stated he doesn't want kids, and he's upset because this happened after a breakup. But the child is his, so even if he didn't plan for it, he might have a moral responsibility. On the other hand, he's not the one who decided to keep the baby; the mother made that choice. But in many ethical frameworks, both parents have responsibilities to the child. So maybe there's a moral obligation to support the child financially, even if he doesn't want contact.\n\nThe author's current partner is mentioned, and they moved into a new apartment. Maybe his financial stability could allow him to pay child support without too much hardship. But he's saying he can't handle it emotionally. But is emotional readiness a valid reason to avoid financial responsibility? That's a bit of a gray area. \n\nThe ex's friends are calling him selfish. That could be because society often expects fathers to support their children. But if the author never wanted kids and there's no contact, does he have to be involved? Legally, yes, but morally, it's debatable. Some people might think he's being selfish, while others might empathize with his situation, especially if the pregnancy was unexpected.\n\nAlso, the fact that they broke up and had no contact for months before the pregnancy might affect things. Did they use contraception? The author says they were \"fairly strict\" with it, but it failed. That's just bad luck, maybe. But he might still be responsible for the child.\n\nSo, putting it all together, legally he's probably not allowed to walk away from financial responsibilities. Morally, it's a tough call. Society might expect him to contribute, but he didn't plan for this. However, since the child is his, he has a duty to support it. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong morally for wanting to avoid that responsibility, even if legally there are limitations. But I need to check if there are legal options for disavowing parental rights, which I'm not certain about. In some cases, if the father was unaware of the pregnancy and there was no contact, maybe there's a way to terminate rights, but I think that's rare. So legally, he might be obligated, and morally, society might see it as his responsibility, making him the asshole for wanting to avoid it.\n"
