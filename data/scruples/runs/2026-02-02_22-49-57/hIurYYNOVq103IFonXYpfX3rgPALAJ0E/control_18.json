We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves an unexpected pregnancy, the author's refusal to be involved, and his desire to avoid financial responsibility. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the facts presented. The author dated a girl for a few months, they broke up, and she later informs him of a pregnancy. He clearly stated he never wanted kids, and they haven't been in contact for months. Now, she wants to get back together, but he refuses. He wants to disavow any parental rights and responsibilities, not pay child support, and avoid contact. Her friends are calling him selfish, but he's stressed due to his new relationship and living situation.\n\nLegally, in many jurisdictions, if someone is the biological father, they are legally responsible for child support. Even if the parents aren't in a relationship anymore, the father is generally required to provide financial support. There might be legal processes to terminate parental rights, but that's not a simple or guaranteed process. So from a legal standpoint, the author might be wrong to think he can just walk away without any responsibilities.\n\nMorally, this is trickier. The author is being honest about his desire not to have children, but the consequences of his actions (or inactions) during the relationship led to a pregnancy. Even if they were using contraception, no method is 100% effective. The mother is choosing to keep the child, so the question is whether the father has a moral obligation. Some might argue that he's responsible for the child's well-being because it's his genetic offspring, while others might say that if he didn't consent to fatherhood, he shouldn't have to bear the financial burden.\n\nAlso, the author's new partner and new apartment might add to his stress, but that doesn't negate the responsibility. The mother's friends are criticizing him, which could indicate societal judgment about parental duties. However, the author is under no obligation to maintain a relationship, just to provide support. The key issue is whether he's morally and legally obligated to pay child support despite not wanting to be a parent.\n\nIn many places, the law prioritizes the child's welfare, requiring both parents to support the child financially regardless of their personal wishes. So legally, he's probably not allowed to just opt out. Morally, it's a gray area. Some people might see it as selfish to avoid support, while others might respect his honesty about not wanting children. But in terms of right or wrong, the legal aspect is more clear-cut\u2014there's an obligation. So the author is likely in the wrong legally, but perhaps not morally in the sense of personal responsibility if the law requires it regardless.\n\nSo the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's refusing a legal responsibility, even if he feels morally conflicted.\n"
