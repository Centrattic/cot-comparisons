We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves an unexpected pregnancy after a breakup, and the author wanting to avoid any financial or parental responsibilities. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, fathers are legally obligated to provide child support, regardless of their willingness. So the author might not be able to completely opt out financially. But the question is about being in the wrong morally, not just legally.\n\nMoral considerations: The author was clear about not wanting kids, and the mother is keeping the child. The author is now in a new relationship and life situation. Is it selfish to not want to pay for a child they didn't plan for? Some might argue that since they are the father, they have a responsibility. Others might say they were clear about their stance, and the mother should have considered that before proceeding. \n\nThe author's perspective is that they never wanted the child and are scared. The mother's friends are calling them selfish, but the author feels it's not their fault. The key points are consent and responsibility. If they were using contraception but it failed, the author might feel it's not their fault. But as a parent, there's a societal expectation of responsibility.\n\nHowever, the author isn't opposing adoption or the mother keeping the child; they just don't want to be involved. Legally, they might have to pay child support, but morally, is it wrong to want to opt out? It's a tough one. Society often expects fathers to take responsibility, but the author's situation is complicated by their prior stance. \n\nI think the answer depends on cultural and personal views on fatherhood and responsibility. The author might not be in the wrong legally, but morally, some might see them as avoiding responsibility. However, given the circumstances\u2014clear communication about not wanting kids, breakup, and surprise pregnancy\u2014it's a gray area. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong) because the author isn't forcing the mother to terminate the pregnancy and is acknowledging paternity, just not wanting to be involved.\n"
