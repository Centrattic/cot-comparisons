We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a man who was in a relationship, didn't want kids, ended it, and then found out the ex is pregnant. He refuses to take any responsibility, including financial, and wants to cut all contact. The user thinks he's not wrong, but wants a second opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, once paternity is established, the father is legally obligated to pay child support. Even if he doesn't want to be involved, the law might require him to contribute financially. So he might not have a legal option to completely disavow responsibility. But maybe there's a way to terminate parental rights, which is a legal process. However, that's usually difficult and requires the court to determine it's in the child's best interest, and the mother's consent might be needed. If the mother is determined to keep the child, the court might not allow the father to walk away financially.\n\nThen there's the moral side. The man was clear about not wanting kids, but the ex is now pregnant. He's not willing to be a parent but also doesn't want to force her to get an abortion or give up the child. Legally, he can't force that. Some people might say he's responsible regardless of his initial wishes. Others might argue that consent and clear communication about not wanting children could absolve him, but that's a gray area. Ethics-wise, there's debate about responsibility beyond consent, especially if the child is born. Even if he doesn't want a relationship, supporting the child's basic needs could be seen as a moral obligation by some.\n\nAlso, the ex's friends are calling him selfish. That's a common judgment, but not necessarily a legal or ethical one. The impact on his current relationship is mentioned, which adds personal context. He's in a new situation, so the sudden financial burden could be a significant issue.\n\nI need to check if the answer is A or B. The user leans towards B (not wrong), but the assistant needs to decide based on facts. Legally, he might have to pay child support unless he can legally terminate rights, which is hard. Morally, it's subjective. So, he might face legal obligations despite his stance, but is he in the wrong? If the law requires it, then he's not in the wrong legally, but morally, it's a different story. The question is about being \"the asshole,\" which is more about social judgment than legal. So, some might say yes, but others might support his right to not be a parent. The answer depends on whether the focus is on legal correctness or moral/social responsibility. The original question is phrased as \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole Here), which is a moral/social inquiry. The user's own opinion is that he's not wrong, but the actual answer might vary. However, in many cases, denying financial responsibility after establishing paternity is seen as selfish. So the answer is likely A.\n"
