We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by understanding the situation. The author had a relationship that ended a few months before the breakup. They didn't talk for a while, and then the ex came back saying she was pregnant. The author was clear they never wanted kids, so this is a big problem for them. They immediately said no to getting back together and hung up. The ex is keeping the baby, and the author wants to cut all ties, no child support, no contact, etc. People are calling them selfish, but the author is stressed because they have a new relationship and a new apartment.\n\nFirst, the legal aspect. In most places, if you're the biological father, you can't just walk away from child support. Even if the parents aren't in a relationship anymore, the father is typically responsible for financial support. The author might be thinking of terminating parental rights, but that's not straightforward. Legally, you can't just \"resign\" as a parent. There might be processes for termination, but it's usually difficult and requires the mother's consent or other circumstances like abuse, which isn't mentioned here.\n\nMoral aspect: The author doesn't want the child, but they are responsible for their existence. Even if they had used contraception, sometimes things fail. The question is whether it's morally okay to walk away. Some might say it's selfish to abandon a child, especially since the child didn't choose their parents. Others might argue that the author had no intention of fatherhood and is being honest about their capabilities.\n\nThe ex's friends are calling them an asshole, which is their opinion. But the author's stance is about personal choice and not wanting to be a parent. However, there's a responsibility aspect here. If the author is the biological father, they might be legally obligated to support the child regardless of their feelings. So, even if they don't want the child, they can't just avoid financial responsibility. The author might be misinformed about the legal options. \"Financial abortion\" isn't a legal term; it might refer to not paying child support, but that could lead to legal consequences.\n\nSo, considering both legal and moral angles, the author might be in the wrong if they refuse to support the child. Legally, they might have obligations they can't avoid. Morally, some would argue that being a parent is a responsibility, even if it's not wanted. The author's refusal to engage could hurt the mother's ability to care for the child if they don't support it. But the author's own mental health and personal choice are also factors. It's a tough spot, but maybe the author is in the wrong because they can't just walk away legally and morally.\n"
