We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) story is in the wrong. The situation involves a person who had a past relationship, broke up, and now the ex is pregnant. The author is adamant about not wanting children and is considering a \"financial abortion,\" meaning they don't want any responsibility for the child, like child support or custody.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many jurisdictions, once you're established as the legal father, you're typically obligated to pay child support. Even if you're not involved in the child's life, the law usually requires financial responsibility. So the author can't just resign all rights without legal implications. They might have to go through a legal process to terminate parental rights, which is difficult and often requires proof of abandonment or other factors.\n\nMorally, this is trickier. The author is clear they never wanted children, and the breakup had already happened. The ex didn't inform them of the pregnancy until months later. The author's refusal to be involved might be seen as selfish by some, especially if the ex is struggling. On the other hand, the author has a new life and a current partner. They weren't aware of the pregnancy until after the fact, so maybe they're not entirely at fault. But the fact that they were in a relationship where unprotected sex could lead to pregnancy might mean both parties have some responsibility. \n\nThe ex's friends are calling the author selfish, but they might not consider the author's stance on not wanting children. The author isn't trying to hurt the ex, just refusing to take on responsibilities they never wanted. However, the child is a human being, and cutting off all support could have long-term consequences for the child's well-being.\n\nI need to check if terminating parental rights is legally possible. In most places, you can voluntarily terminate your rights, but once you've acknowledged paternity, you might need the court's approval. If the author goes through with termination, the ex would need to find another solution, like adoption, but that's her responsibility now. Legally, the author could be off the hook, but morally, some might argue they have a duty as a parent. \n\nThe author's stance is about not wanting to be a parent, which is their choice, but the child's existence is a reality. The key here is whether the author's refusal to pay child support is morally wrong. If they never wanted to be a parent and the pregnancy wasn't planned, maybe they aren't the asshole. However, the responsibility of parenthood includes financial support regardless of desire. So the answer might depend on the balance between personal choice and societal expectations.\n\nIn summary, legally the author might be able to disengage through proper channels, but morally, it's a gray area. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Given that they were clear about not wanting kids and the pregnancy happened after a breakup, the author's position could be seen as not in the wrong. However, others might see it as selfish for not supporting the child's needs. But since the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, I should consider that perspective.\n"
