We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting a financial abortion. So, the situation is that he was in a relationship, they broke up, and then the ex-girlfriend got pregnant. He's clear he never wanted kids, and he's not wanting to take any responsibility now. He wants no contact, no child support, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In many places, fathers have legal responsibilities once paternity is established. Even if he doesn't want to be involved, he might still be required to pay child support. So legally, he might be in trouble if he refuses. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong morally.\n\nMorally, it's tricky. The woman is carrying his child, which is a consequence of their past relationship. He might not have wanted the breakup to lead to this, but he's a biological parent. Some might argue that having a child is a joint responsibility, so even if he doesn't want to be involved, he's responsible financially. Others might say that if he made his stance clear about not wanting kids, and the mother went ahead with the pregnancy despite his wishes, she has some responsibility too.\n\nBut the mother is choosing to keep the child, so she's the one making that decision. However, the father's right to disengage is complicated. In some legal systems, fathers can disclaim paternity if they were not involved during the pregnancy, but that's not universal. If he can't legally disclaim, then he's stuck with financial obligations.\n\nThe author's new relationship might add pressure, but that's his personal situation. His friends are calling him selfish, but is he actually selfish? He's not causing the pregnancy; he's responding to a situation he didn't want. However, by not taking responsibility, he's leaving the mother to handle everything alone, which some might see as selfish.\n\nOn the other hand, if he had been clear about not wanting kids, and the mother proceeded with the pregnancy, maybe she should bear some responsibility. But child support is a common legal requirement regardless of the circumstances. So legally, he's probably not allowed to avoid it. Morally, there's a divide between personal desire for no children and societal expectations of paternal responsibility.\n\nIn summary, the author might not be in the wrong morally if he was clear about his stance and the mother chose to keep the child. However, legally, he's likely obligated to pay child support. The main conflict is between his personal desires and societal/legal responsibilities. The answer hinges on whether one prioritizes his autonomy in not wanting children or the child's right to support from both parents.\n"
