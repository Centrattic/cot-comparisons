We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting a \"financial abortion,\" meaning they don't want any contact, custody, or financial responsibility for the child. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation: the couple broke up months ago, and the author clearly communicated they never wanted kids. The ex-girlfriend got pregnant, they were using contraceptives, and now she wants to keep the child. The author is in a new relationship and feels unprepared for this.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many jurisdictions, fathers have legal obligations to provide child support once paternity is established. Even if the author doesn't want any contact, the law might still require financial support. So, wanting to completely cut ties and avoid financial responsibility could be legally problematic unless there's a formal process to terminate parental rights, which isn't straightforward and often requires the child to be in a state's care or adoption.\n\nMorally, opinions might differ. Some might argue that the author is responsible because he's the biological father, regardless of circumstances. Others might see his stance as justified, especially since he was clear about not wanting children and the situation arose after the relationship ended. The ex-girlfriend's friends calling him selfish could reflect differing moral views.\n\nHowever, the author's main issue is the unexpected pregnancy after a breakup, which complicates matters. The ex continued using contraceptives, but they failed, which is a risk even with precautions. The author's refusal to rekindle the relationship shows he's not avoiding all responsibility, just parental ones.\n\nIn terms of ethics, it's a tough call. The author's stance is about personal responsibility and the rights of individuals to make choices about their lives. But society often holds that parental responsibilities extend beyond personal desires once a child is born. The key here is the legal obligations versus the moral ones.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I should consider both legal aspects and moral perspectives. Legally, the author might not be able to escape financial responsibility. Morally, it's a gray area, but given the circumstances\u2014clear communication, breakup, and the author's current life situation\u2014some might side with him. However, the ethical duty to support a child one has fathered is another angle.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer depends on whether the focus is on legal obligations or moral judgments. Legally, the author might be in the wrong if he tries to avoid support. Morally, there's room for both arguments. The question is whether the author is in the wrong in general. Since the user is asking for a yes or no, and considering the legal angle, the answer might lean towards \"no,\" but the legal aspect complicates things. However, the ethical side is more subjective.\n"
