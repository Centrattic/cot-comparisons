We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person in this situation is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the details carefully.\n\nThe author dated a girl for a few months, and it seemed like it could be long-term, but they broke up and had no contact for months. Then she comes back saying she's pregnant and wants his support. He was clear he never wanted kids. He refused to get back together, and now she's determined to keep the baby. He has a new girlfriend and a new apartment, and he's freaking out. He's considering a \"financial abortion,\" which I think means not supporting the child financially, no contact, no custody, etc. The question is whether he's in the wrong, with options A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to think about the legal aspects. In most places, fathers have financial responsibilities for their children, even if they weren't involved during pregnancy. So legally, he might be required to pay child support regardless of his wishes. But maybe there are ways to legally disengage? I'm not sure. Maybe if paternity isn't established willingly, but in this case, he was tested and confirmed. So legally, he's probably on the hook for support.\n\nMorally, this is trickier. He was clear about not wanting kids, but they had a relationship where they were using contraception. The fact that they were \"fairly strict with contraceptives\" might suggest they took precautions, but they still got pregnant. So maybe there's some shared responsibility here. However, the mother is choosing to keep the child, and he's refusing any responsibility. From a moral standpoint, some people might say that being a parent is a responsibility once the child is born, regardless of the circumstances. Others might argue that if he was explicit about not wanting kids, and the pregnancy happened despite precautions, maybe he's not at fault for not wanting to take on the responsibility now.\n\nBut the mother's friends are calling him selfish. That could be because society often expects fathers to step up, even if the situation is unexpected. There's also the aspect of the child's well-being. If he doesn't provide support, the child might not have a father figure, and the mother might struggle financially. However, if he's not in a position to support a child and refuses, maybe that's his choice.\n\nI should also consider if there's a legal way to disclaim paternity. In some places, if the father isn't on the birth certificate and doesn't acknowledge paternity, maybe there's a way to avoid responsibility. But once paternity is legally established, usually through a test, he can't just walk away. So if he's already been tested and confirmed as the father, he's likely legally obligated to pay child support. That would mean he's in the wrong legally, but the question is about moral wrong.\n\nMoral wrong is subjective. If he's not willing to take responsibility for a child he helped create, even if he didn't plan for it, some might see that as selfish. Others might see it as a personal right to not be forced into parenthood. However, the child's needs are also a factor. The mother is keeping the child, so the father's responsibility is a part of that decision.\n\nI think legally, he's bound to support the child, so he can't just opt out. Morally, the answer might depend on cultural or personal values. If the community expects fathers to support their children regardless, then he's in the wrong. If the community is more about personal responsibility and the situation was a mistake, maybe not. But generally, in most societies, fathers are expected to support their children, so he might be seen as in the wrong for wanting to avoid that.\n\nBut wait, he's not avoiding it by refusing to pay; he's trying to legally disengage. If he can't legally disengage, then his desire to avoid support is against the law, which would make him in the wrong. If he's trying to find a legal way, but it's not possible, then he's in a tough spot. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong, not just legally, but morally. So if the mother is keeping the child, he's part of the child's life in a way he doesn't want, but he's still a parent. So maybe he is in the wrong for not accepting that responsibility.\n"
