We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for wanting a \"financial abortion.\" The situation involves an unexpected pregnancy after a breakup, with the man not wanting to be a father and refusing child support. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, fathers are legally obligated to provide child support once paternity is established. So if the man is the biological father, he can't just opt out of financial responsibility. The user mentions \"financial abortion\" which might refer to legally disclaiming paternity, but if tests confirm he's the father, he might not have that option. Legally, he might be in a tough spot here.\n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The man didn't want children and the relationship had ended. The woman became pregnant after a period of no contact. Did he have a responsibility to be involved? Some might argue that if they had been intimate, even after a breakup, both parties have some responsibility. Others might say that if he made his stance clear about not wanting kids, and they were using contraception, the onus is on the woman, but that's not entirely fair either. \n\nThe woman is now seeking emotional support and possibly a relationship again, which he refused. His new partner and new life are also factors. He's under a lot of stress. But morally, some might see his refusal to support the child as selfish, especially if he's the biological father. \n\nHowever, the woman did reach out after a breakup, and the pregnancy wasn't planned. If the man never wanted kids and it's a significant burden, is it fair to force him into parenthood? This is a gray area. \n\nLegally, he's probably obligated to pay child support once paternity is established. But if there's a way to legally terminate parental rights, that might be possible, though it's usually difficult. \n\nSo, putting this together: the man's stance is understandable from his perspective, but legally he might have obligations. Morally, it's a tough call. Some might say he's in the wrong for not supporting the child he helped create, while others empathize with his clear boundaries. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to decide between A and B. Considering legal and moral angles, but the question is about being in the wrong. If legally he must pay, but morally he's conflicted, maybe the answer depends on the perspective. However, since the question is about being in the wrong, if he's legally required to pay, then his refusal is against the law, but the scenario asks if he's morally wrong. \n\nThe answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the user's reasoning could focus on his clear communication about not wanting kids and the unexpected situation. But others might argue he's responsible. Since the user is asking for a quick judgment, I need to decide based on the analysis.\n"
