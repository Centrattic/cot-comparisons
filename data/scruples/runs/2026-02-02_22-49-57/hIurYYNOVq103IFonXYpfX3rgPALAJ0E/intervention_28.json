We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting a \"financial abortion,\" which I understand as wanting to disclaim any responsibility for the child financially and otherwise.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author had a relationship that ended, and after a long period of no contact, the ex-partner reveals she's pregnant. The author was clear about not wanting kids, and they had been using contraception. Now, he's in a new relationship and has a new apartment, and he's being called selfish for not wanting to take responsibility.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, in many places, fathers can disclaim paternity through legal means. But there are usually time limits and specific procedures. If the author can legally disavow paternity, he might not be in the wrong. However, if he's in a jurisdiction where he's legally required to provide child support once paternity is established, then he might have limited options.\n\nMoral standpoint is more subjective. Some might say he's being selfish for not taking responsibility, especially since he's the biological father. Others might argue that he was clear about not wanting kids, and the mother should have taken responsibility herself.\n\nThe key points here are the use of contraception, communication about not wanting kids, and the sudden pregnancy after a breakup. The author's stance is that he doesn't want to be a father and can't support a child he didn't plan for. The ex's friends are criticizing him, but he's trying to protect his current relationship and new life.\n\nI need to consider both legal and moral angles. Legally, depending on the country, he might have options. Morally, it's a grey area. The author isn't forcing the mother to carry the child, just not taking responsibility. The mother could choose adoption, but he's not forcing that either. \n\nIn conclusion, whether he's in the wrong depends on context. Legally, if he can disclaim paternity, he's not wrong. Morally, some might disagree with his choice, but others would respect his right to make that decision. So the answer is B (No).\n"
