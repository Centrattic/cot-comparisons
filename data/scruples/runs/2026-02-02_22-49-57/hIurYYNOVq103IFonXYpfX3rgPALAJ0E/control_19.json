We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong, and they want a yes (A) or no (B) answer. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The person was in a relationship that ended, then the ex-girlfriend got pregnant. They were clear about not wanting kids. Now she wants support, but he doesn't want to be involved, even financially. He's seeking a \"financial abortion,\" meaning cutting out all responsibility. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider legal and moral aspects. Legally, in most places, if you're the biological father, you're usually responsible for child support, regardless of wanting to be a parent or not. So wanting to avoid that might be legally problematic. But the user is asking if he's in the wrong morally, not just legally.\n\nMorally, there's a debate. Some might say he's responsible for his actions, even if the pregnancy wasn't planned. Others might see his stance as selfish, given that he contributed to the situation. However, he was clear about not wanting kids, which could be a factor. The ex is pushing to keep the child, so he can't force adoption or abortion. \n\nThe ex's friends are calling him selfish, but he's under stress. His current relationship is stable, and he doesn't want to be a parent. The key points are consent to parenthood, responsibility for offspring, and whether cutting off all ties is ethical.\n\nLegally, he might not have the option to disavow all rights if he's the father. But the question is about being in the wrong. If he's legally required to pay child support, then morally, maybe he's responsible. But if he wants to avoid all contact and financial support, that's where the conflict arises.\n\nI need to check if in any jurisdictions you can legally disavow paternity to avoid support. I think in most cases, once paternity is established (via DNA tests), you can't just walk away. So legally, he might be required to pay. But the question is about being in the wrong, not legal repercussions.\n\nMoral standpoint: Some argue that creating life has responsibilities. Others say you shouldn't be forced to support a child you didn't want. The fact that they used contraception but it failed complicates things. He might feel it's the woman's responsibility if they were using birth control, but she might argue he should share responsibility.\n\nHis current partner's situation is also a factor\u2014moving into a new apartment, maybe financial strain. But morally, is he wrong for not wanting to help? It's a tough call. The ex's friends see him as selfish, but he's clear he doesn't want a child. \n\nIn conclusion, while legally he might be obligated, morally, there's room for both views. However, since the question is whether he's in the wrong, the answer might depend on societal values. Many might see him as in the wrong because he's a parent now and has responsibilities, even if he didn't intend to be. So answer A (yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
