We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The user is a guy who had a relationship that ended a few months ago. They weren't in contact after the breakup, and then the ex-girlfriend contact him saying she's pregnant and wants his support. He never wanted kids, was clear about it, and now he's refusing to get back together, not taking responsibility for the child, and wants to avoid child support and any involvement. He's got a new girlfriend and a new apartment, so this is really throwing him off. The question is whether he's in the wrong here.\n\nFirst, I should consider the legal aspects. In most places, when a child is born, both parents are legally responsible for child support, regardless of whether they wanted the child or not. So even if he doesn't want to be a father, he can't just walk away from financial responsibilities. Legally, he might be required to pay child support. So if he tries to \"resign\" his rights, is that possible? I think you can renounce paternity after it's established, but it's complicated and the court might not agree, especially if the child's best interest is considered. So legally, he's probably in trouble if he tries to avoid support.\n\nMoral aspect: This is more subjective. Some people might say that regardless of the circumstances, a parent has a moral responsibility to their child. Others might argue that if the child wasn't wanted and the parent made that clear, they shouldn't be forced to support it. But in this case, the guy was in a relationship where they used contraception, so maybe he feels wronged. However, even if they were careful, accidents happen. The mother wants to keep the child, so he can't force an abortion. So the moral dilemma is between his right to not be a parent and the child's right to support. From a moral standpoint, some might say he's selfish for abandoning the child, while others might empathize with his situation given his clear stance on not wanting kids.\n\nEmotionally, he's clearly stressed. He's in a new relationship and a new apartment, and this is a huge disruption. But the ex is also going through a lot, and her friends are upset with him for not being supportive. But he's not willing to be part of the child's life. The question is whether his decision is justified.\n\nAlso, the user is asking if it's morally and legally okay. Legally, probably not. Morally, it's debatable. But since the question is whether he's in the wrong, which is a mix of both. The answer could be A (he's in the wrong) because legally he has responsibilities, and morally, some would say he should take responsibility for the child. But maybe others would argue B (not in the wrong) if he's being realistic about his life choices. However, the common consensus might lean towards A because of the legal and moral obligations.\n"
