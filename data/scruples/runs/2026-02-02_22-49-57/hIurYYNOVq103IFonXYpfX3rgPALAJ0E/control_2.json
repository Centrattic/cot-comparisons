We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The scenario is about a man who's facing an unexpected pregnancy from a past relationship. He doesn't want kids and wants to avoid any financial or parental responsibilities. The key points here are legal and moral obligations, and whether he's being selfish.\n\nFirst, legally, in most places, a father can be required to pay child support even if they don't want contact or custody. There might be ways to contest paternity if there's doubt, but the user mentioned tests confirmed it's his. So legally, he might have to pay unless he can legally terminate parental rights. But terminating rights is usually not the father's choice unless it's through adoption, which the mother isn't considering. So if he wants no responsibilities, he might be stuck with support payments. Legally, he's probably bound here.\n\nMorally, the question is trickier. The mother is choosing to keep the child, so the father could argue he's not responsible if they were using contraception. However, using contraception isn't 100% foolproof, so maybe he shares some responsibility. But he was clear he didn't want kids. Still, once a child is conceived, there's an argument that he has a moral duty to support it, even if he didn't plan for it. On the other hand, he's not in a relationship anymore and has a new partner. The mother's friends are calling him selfish, which leans into the moral judgment that he should support the child.\n\nThe term \"financial abortion\" isn't a legal term, but it implies cutting off financial ties. Legally, that's probably not possible if he's the father. Morally, some might see it as selfish to walk away from a child you're responsible for, while others might see it as respecting his right to not be a parent. The user is stressed and wants to avoid responsibilities, which could be seen as inconsiderate towards the child's needs.\n\nIn summary, legally he might be in a bind where he can't avoid support, and morally, there's a debate. The answer hinges on societal views on parental responsibility. The options are A (he's wrong) or B (not). Considering the legal obligations and the moral duty argument, the answer is likely A because he's avoiding responsibilities that come with fatherhood, even if the situation is unexpected.\n"
