We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he dated a girl, they broke up, didn't talk for months, then she calls saying she's pregnant and wants support. He was clear he didn't want kids, and now he's considering cutting off all financial and parental responsibilities.\n\nFirst, I need to think about legal aspects. In many places, if you're the biological father, you're legally responsible for child support, even if you don't want to be involved. So if he tries to disown the kid, the court might not let him get away with that. He might still have to pay child support regardless. So legally, he might not have a choice, but the question is more about moral or ethical wrongdoing.\n\nMorally, it's complicated. He didn't want kids, and the pregnancy happened despite using contraceptives. But he was a sexual partner, so there's a responsibility there. However, he's not in a relationship anymore, and she's the one who ended the communication and then got pregnant. But when you have sex, you take on some responsibility for possible consequences. Even if they broke up, if they were in a relationship and had unprotected sex, both parties have a role. The fact that they used contraceptives but it still happened is a factor. Maybe they weren't 100% effective, but the responsibility isn't entirely on her.\n\nHe mentions he's with a new girlfriend and a new apartment, so he's moving on. But wanting to cut off all support could be seen as abandoning a child he helped create. The mother's friends are calling him selfish, which might be valid if he's refusing to help. However, he's clear he never wanted kids, so his position is that he's not willing to take on that responsibility. But is that selfish? Or is he just being realistic about his own desires?\n\nEthically, some might argue that once a child is born, the father has a duty to support it, regardless of his initial wishes. Others might say that if he didn't want children and was clear about it, the mother should have considered that before getting pregnant. But the problem is that both parties had a sexual relationship, so there's mutual responsibility. The mother might have known his stance and still chose to continue the pregnancy. So maybe she's also responsible, but that doesn't absolve him of all responsibility.\n\nAlso, the emotional impact on the author is real. He's stressed and his new life is being disrupted. But the child's well-being is also a factor. If he doesn't pay child support, the mother might struggle financially, which could affect the child. So by refusing to help, he's putting the child in a tougher situation.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the author might be in the wrong morally because he's refusing to take responsibility for a child he fathered, even if he didn't want to. Legally, he might not have a choice, but ethically, it's about taking responsibility for your actions. Even if the pregnancy was unexpected, once it happened, he's part of the child's life. Cutting off all support could be seen as selfish and harmful to the child's future.\n"
