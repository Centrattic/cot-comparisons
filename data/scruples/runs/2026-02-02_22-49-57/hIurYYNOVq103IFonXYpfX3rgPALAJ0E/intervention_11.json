We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is that he was in a relationship, they broke up, then the ex got pregnant. He never wanted kids, they were using contraception, and now she's carrying the baby. He wants to cut all ties, no child support, no custody, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both legal and moral aspects. Legally, in most places, a father can't just disclaim responsibility completely. Even if he doesn't want custody or contact, he might still be required to pay child support. So if he's trying to avoid legal obligations, that could be a problem. But the legal side varies by jurisdiction, so maybe the user is asking about moral responsibility.\n\nMorally, this is trickier. The man didn't want kids and made that clear, but the pregnancy happened. He's not the one to decide the child's fate, so he can't force an abortion. But he's also not responsible for supporting the child if he's not willing. However, some might argue that he has a moral obligation since he's the biological father. Others might say he's not responsible because he's not part of the child's life and didn't consent to parenthood.\n\nThe author is stressed because of his new relationship and living situation. His ex and her friends are calling him selfish. But from his perspective, he's being honest about his feelings. It's possible he's in a tough spot where he's being blamed for circumstances beyond his control, especially if they were using birth control and the pregnancy was an accident.\n\nI need to check if there's any indication that he was negligent in preventing the pregnancy. The post mentions they were \"fairly strict with contraceptives,\" so maybe it was a failure on their part. That might mitigate some blame.\n\nAlso, after the breakup, they hadn't communicated for months. The ex reached out after getting pregnant. He was clear about not wanting kids, so it's not like he was leading her on. If the pregnancy was a surprise, and he's now trying to avoid responsibility, but legally can't, then maybe he's in the right morally if he can't legally disclaim.\n\nBut if he's trying to avoid all responsibility and the law says he has to pay, then maybe he's wrong for trying to avoid it. However, the user is asking if he's in the wrong morally, not legally. So maybe the answer is B, he's not in the wrong. He made his intentions clear, the situation is a tragedy, and he's not the one to decide the child's fate, so his stance is understandable.\n"
