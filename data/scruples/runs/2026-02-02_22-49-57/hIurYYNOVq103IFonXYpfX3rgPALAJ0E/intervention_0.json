We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe person dated a girl for a few months, thinking it might be long-term, but they broke up and had no contact for a few months. Then the ex contacts him, saying she's pregnant and he's the father. He's clear he doesn't want kids, so he refuses to get back together. He's now with a new girlfriend and a new apartment, and he's really stressed about this. He wants to do a \"financial abortion,\" meaning he doesn't want to have any responsibilities like child support or custody. The ex's friends are calling him selfish, but he doesn't feel he can handle this. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, let's consider the legal aspects. In many places, fathers have legal responsibilities once paternity is established. Even if he doesn't want the child, he might still be required by law to pay child support. So legally, he might have no choice but to contribute financially. But the author is asking if it's morally and legally okay. Legally, I think he's in a tough spot because laws often require child support.\n\nMorally, this is more complex. He was clear he didn't want kids, but the situation happened regardless. The ex was the one who decided to keep the child, so perhaps she's responsible for the decision. However, he's being blamed for the pregnancy. Contraceptives were used, but they were \"fairly strict,\" which might not be 100% effective. He's not willing to take responsibility, which could be seen as selfish because he's the biological father. On the other hand, he never wanted the relationship to go that far, and the breakup was months prior. \n\nBut in many moral frameworks, once you're a parent, you have responsibilities. Even if the child is unwanted, the argument is that the child has a right to support. However, the author didn't plan for this and it's causing him a lot of stress. The ex's friends are calling him selfish, which adds to the conflict. \n\nI need to balance the legal obligation against the moral responsibility. Legally, he's likely obligated. Morally, some might say he's in the wrong because he's a father now, but others might argue he wasn't given a choice in the matter. The key points are that he was clear about not wanting kids, but the situation happened, and he's trying to avoid responsibility. \n\nIn some cultures, there's a strong emphasis on parental responsibility regardless of circumstances, so he might be seen as in the wrong. However, others might empathize with his position, especially if the relationship ended and he wasn't planning for a family. \n\nSo, putting it all together, I think the answer is B (the author is not in the wrong) because he was clear about his intentions, but there's a strong argument that he does have responsibilities. However, given the context of the situation and his clear communication, maybe he's not entirely at fault. But I'm a bit conflicted. The legal angle complicates things, but the question is about being in the wrong morally. If the law requires child support, then he's legally bound, but morally, it's a gray area. The community's perspective might be that he's selfish, but the user is asking if he's in the wrong. Considering all this, I think the answer leans towards B, but it's close.\n"
