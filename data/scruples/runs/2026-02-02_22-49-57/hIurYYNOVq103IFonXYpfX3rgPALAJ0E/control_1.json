We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the author (the person in the situation) is in the wrong for wanting a financial abortion. Let's break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the author had a relationship that ended months ago. They were clear they didn't want kids. Then the ex contacts them saying she's pregnant. The author is shocked, refuses to get back together, and wants nothing to do with the child. He's now in a new relationship and stable living, and the situation is causing him a lot of stress. He wants to avoid any legal responsibilities like child support or custody. The ex's friends are calling him selfish.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Legally, in many places, a father does have responsibilities regardless of wanting the child. So he can't just resign all rights; the court might require child support. But he's asking if it's morally okay. Morally, people might see it as selfish not to support a child you fathered, even if the circumstances are unexpected. However, others might argue he's not responsible since the ex is keeping the child and the pregnancy happened despite precautions. But he did have a child, so there's an argument that he's responsible regardless of intentions. \n\nThe key points are: he was clear about not wanting kids, the relationship ended, the pregnancy was unexpected, but now he's avoiding responsibility. Legally, he probably can't avoid it. Morally, it's a gray area. The ex is choosing to keep the child, so he can't force an abortion or adoption. But by law, he's a father and might have obligations. The ex's friends think he's being selfish, which adds to the moral judgment.\n\nSo, the answer would depend on legal context, but the user is asking if the author is in the wrong. Since morally, many would say he's responsible for the child he fathered, even if unintentionally, the author is in the wrong (A). He can't just walk away. However, if the legal system allows him to terminate parental rights (which is possible in some cases if the father doesn't want to be involved), but that's a legal process, not just a moral decision. Since he's looking for moral judgment here, the consensus might lean towards A.\n"
