We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting a \"financial abortion\" after an unexpected pregnancy. The situation is that he had a relationship that ended, they didn't speak for months, and then she called saying she's pregnant. He didn't want kids and was clear about that, she wanted to get back together but he refused. Now he's in a new relationship and doesn't want to be involved financially or otherwise.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many jurisdictions, fathers do have legal responsibilities, including child support, once paternity is established. Even if the father doesn't want the child, he might be required by law to provide financial support. The concept of \"financial abortion\" might not exist legally, so he could be facing court-mandated payments. That's a key point here.\n\nThen there's the moral angle. The author is being called selfish by some. Arguably, a child is a human life, and the father has a responsibility to support it. However, the author made it clear he didn't want kids, and the pregnancy occurred despite using contraception. That might affect public opinion. But morally, is it right to abandon a child? Different people might have different views here.\n\nEmotional and psychological factors are also important. The author is stressed, in a new relationship, and this situation is causing him a lot of anxiety. On the other hand, the mother is seeking support and the child's well-being is at stake. The mother's friends are criticizing him, but the author is standing his ground based on his previous statements.\n\nThe user says they think the author isn't in the wrong but wants to know if that's the case. So, the answer hinges on legal and moral considerations. Legally, he might have obligations. Morally, some might see it as selfish to disengage, while others might respect his stance given his prior clarity.\n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the law requires support, then he's legally wrong if he refuses. Morally, it's more subjective. The answer might depend on the perspective taken. However, in many societies, parental responsibility is considered a moral duty regardless of circumstances. So, even if legally he can fight it, morally he might be seen as in the wrong for not providing support. \n\nAlso, the fact that he was clear about not wanting kids but the child was conceived anyway might be a factor. However, the responsibility for contraception is shared, so that doesn't absolve him. The sudden demand after a breakup adds complexity. \n\nSo, considering legal and moral angles, the author might be in the wrong both legally (if he has to pay) and morally (as abandoning a child is often seen as selfish). But the user's own opinion is that he's not wrong. The answer needs to choose A or B based on the analysis.\n"
