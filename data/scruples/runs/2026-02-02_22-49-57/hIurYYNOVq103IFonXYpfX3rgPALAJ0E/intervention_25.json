We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The question is about a \"financial abortion,\" where the person wants to disclaim all responsibility for the child they didn't plan to have. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The guy had a relationship, they broke up, and then the ex got pregnant. He was clear he didn't want kids. Now she wants him to be involved or support the child, but he doesn't. He's against child support and any contact. His new relationship is mentioned, and he's stressed about it.\n\nFrom a legal standpoint, I know that in many places, fathers have legal obligations to support their children, even if they don't want to. So trying to \"resign\" his rights might not be possible without court intervention. Legally, he might have to pay child support unless the mother agrees to relinquish custody. But the user is asking about moral wrong, not just legal.\n\nMorally, this is tricky. He was in a relationship, and pregnancy is a shared responsibility. Even if he didn't want kids, the fact that they had a sexual relationship where contraception failed (they were \"fairly strict\" but still) means both parties have some responsibility. He's taking a stance that he doesn't want any part in the child's life, which could be seen as selfish. However, there's a difference between legal obligations and personal desire. If he was never in the relationship for the long term, maybe that's a factor.\n\nThe ex and her friends are upset, calling him selfish. That's a common reaction when someone doesn't take responsibility for a child. But the author is also in a new relationship and situation that's already stable, so he's under stress. However, the argument is whether he's morally at fault. If he's not the one who wanted to keep the child, but he's responsible for creating the situation (even if unintentionally), maybe he's in the wrong for not taking responsibility.\n\nOn the other hand, he was clear he didn't want kids. The mother went ahead and decided to keep the child. So maybe she has some responsibility here. But once a child is born, the father's rights and responsibilities are a separate issue. Even if he didn't want the child, he's still a parent, and disavowing responsibility could be seen as morally wrong, especially towards the child.\n\nBut the question is if he's in the wrong. Legally, he might have to pay, but morally, it's more complex. The community might view him as selfish for not taking responsibility. However, if he was explicit about his stance on children, perhaps the mother should have considered that before deciding to keep the child. But it's a bit of a gray area. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer might be that he is in the wrong morally because he's disavowing responsibility for a child he helped create, even if he didn't want it. However, there's the argument that the mother should have considered his stance. But since he was part of the relationship where the child was conceived, he shares responsibility. So I think the answer is A, he is in the wrong.\n"
