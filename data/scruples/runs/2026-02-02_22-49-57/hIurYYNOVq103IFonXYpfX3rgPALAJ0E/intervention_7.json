We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who had a few months of dating, broke up, and then found out the ex is pregnant. He never wanted kids, they were using contraception, and now he wants to disengage completely\u2014no contact, no child support, no custody. He's being called selfish by her friends, and he's asking if he's the asshole or if he's justified in wanting a financial abortion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, when a man is determined to be the legal father (through DNA tests), he's obligated to pay child support regardless of whether he wants to be involved. So even if he doesn't want to be part of the kid's life, the law might require him to contribute financially. That could mean he's in the wrong legally, but the question is about moral wrong, not just legal.\n\nMorally, it's a tricky area. The guy says he was clear about not wanting kids. But the ex was the one who decided to keep the baby. He can't force her to get an abortion, so he's not making her terminate the pregnancy. But by refusing to support the child, some might see it as abandoning the child, which is a life. Others might argue that he's being realistic about his ability to handle the responsibility and that it's not fair to make him support a child he didn't plan for.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to weigh both sides. On one hand, he's following through on his stated values. On the other, the child is a human being that he's responsible for, even if he didn't plan it. The fact that they broke up and he was clear about not wanting kids is on his side, but the responsibility of fatherhood is a significant part of the discussion. Also, the ex's friends are criticizing him for being selfish, which adds pressure to the situation. \n\nBut the key points here are: Was he clear about not wanting kids? Yes. Did they use contraception? Yes, but that failed. Now, he's trying to avoid responsibility. Legally, he might have to pay child support. Morally, some might argue that once a child is born, the father has a duty to support it. So even if he doesn't want to be involved, he might still have a moral obligation. However, others might say that he can't be forced to support a child he didn't plan for, especially if he's in a new relationship and has a new life. \n\nThe line between legal and moral is important here. If the law requires him to pay, but he refuses, that's a legal issue. Morally, it's about responsibility. So the answer might depend on the jurisdiction, but the question is about being in the wrong morally. The user is asking if the author is the asshole. The options are A for yes, B for no. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because he was clear about his stance on kids, and the situation is tragic. But others might argue that he's abandoning the child. However, since he can't force the mother to give up the child, and he's not the one who chose to continue the pregnancy, his refusal to support might be seen as reasonable in some ethical frameworks. But another angle is that once the child exists, he has a responsibility. It's a tough call. Maybe the answer is B, but I'm a bit conflicted.\n"
