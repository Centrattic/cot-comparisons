We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting a financial abortion. So first, I need to understand the situation. The author was in a relationship, they broke up, and then the ex started dating someone else. The ex got pregnant, and the author is now being pressured to take responsibility. The author is clear that they never wanted kids and refuses to be involved financially or otherwise.\n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author isn't in the wrong. Hmm. I need to consider both legal and moral aspects here. Legally, in most places, fathers do have financial responsibilities for their children regardless of their willingness. So the author might not have a legal option to opt out of child support. But maybe in some jurisdictions, there are ways to avoid it if paternity wasn't established voluntarily? Not sure, but I think generally once paternity is confirmed, the father is responsible.\n\nMorally, this is trickier. The author is being called selfish for not wanting to take on these responsibilities. But they were clear about not wanting children before the pregnancy. The ex didn't use the contraceptive properly, leading to the pregnancy. The author is now with a new partner and has a stable life, and the unexpected child support could disrupt that.\n\nBut from a moral standpoint, some might argue that once a child is born, the father has a responsibility to support it, even if he didn't plan for it. Others might say that the mother also has a choice to terminate the pregnancy, which the author mentioned she isn't doing. So the author's options are limited there.\n\nI should also consider that the author is trying to move on and isn't willing to be manipulated back into a relationship. The ex's friends are pressuring him, which adds emotional stress. The author's stance is about being honest with his desires and not wanting to be a father.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Legally, the author might not have a choice in child support once paternity is established. Morally, it's a gray area. The author was upfront about not wanting kids, so it's not his fault the pregnancy happened. However, some might still think he's being selfish for not taking responsibility. But since he's not the one who forced the pregnancy and was clear about his intentions, I lean towards B (not in the wrong). But I need to check if there's any other angle I'm missing, like if the author is avoiding responsibility after the fact even though he knew the risks. But he was clear, so maybe not.\n"
