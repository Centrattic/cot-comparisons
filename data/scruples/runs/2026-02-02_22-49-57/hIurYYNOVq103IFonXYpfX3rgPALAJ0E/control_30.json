We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting a financial abortion, which means not claiming any rights or responsibilities for the child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, once a child is born, the father has legal responsibilities, including child support. Even if the father didn't want the child, once the child exists, legal obligations might kick in. The author might not be able to completely disassociate from the child legally because of paternity. So, wanting to stop all contact and avoid child support could be legally problematic. That's one angle where the author might be in the wrong.\n\nThen there's the moral side. The author is clear they never wanted kids, but now they're involved in someone else's pregnancy. The mother is keeping the child, and the author wants nothing to do with it. Morally, some people might argue that as a father, even if not biological in intent, there's a responsibility to the child. However, others might see it as the mother's choice and the father's right to disengage, especially if forced into parenthood without consent.\n\nThe situation is complicated by the breakup and lack of communication. The author wasn't trying to become a parent, and the mother's actions after the breakup might be a factor. The author's current relationship and new life could also influence their stance\u2014they might feel overwhelmed and unprepared for parenthood.\n\nBut here's the thing: even if the author doesn't want to be a father, legally, they might have to accept some responsibilities. So if they refuse child support, that could lead to legal issues. Morally, the answer varies depending on societal views. Some see it as selfish, others as realistic if the author isn't in a position to provide support.\n\nThe mother's friends calling the author selfish adds another layer. The author might be seen as avoiding responsibility, but they're also dealing with unexpected circumstances. The key points are consent, responsibility, and the impact on the child's life.\n\nIn summary, the author's actions might be legally questionable because they can't unilaterally disavow paternity once the child is born. Morally, it's a gray area. The answer depends on whether the focus is on legal obligations or personal rights. Since the question is about being in the wrong, legally they might be, but morally it's more nuanced. However, since the user asks if they're in the wrong, and legal obligations can't be ignored, the answer might lean towards A (Yes), but I need to check if the options are A or B.\n"
