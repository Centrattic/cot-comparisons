We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author dated a girl for a few months, and it seemed like it could be long-term. Then they broke up and had no contact for several months. The girl then contacts him, saying she's pregnant and needs his support. The author was clear before that he never wants kids. He refused to get back together, explained he doesn't want to be a father, and hung up. The baby is confirmed to be his. Now he's in a new relationship and moved into a new apartment. He's considering a \"financial abortion,\" which means not having any contact, no child support, no custody. He's being called selfish by her friends, but he's stressed and doesn't want to be a parent. The question is whether he's the asshole for wanting to disengage completely.\n\nFirst, I should consider the legal aspects. In most places, once a man is determined to be the legal father, he is responsible for child support. Even if he doesn't want to be involved, the law usually requires him to contribute financially. There's a process called \"paternity establishment,\" and once that's done, he can't just opt out. There might be ways to deny paternity if there's evidence, but if tests confirm he's the father, that's a problem for his argument. The concept of a \"financial abortion\" might not exist legally; he can't disclaim his rights and responsibilities once paternity is established. Legally, he's likely going to be obligated to pay child support regardless of his personal feelings.\n\nMorally, it's a bit more complex. The author was clear about his stance on not wanting kids, but the situation arose despite using contraceptives. However, he was involved in a relationship where pregnancy is a possible consequence. The fact that they broke up and had no contact doesn't absolve him of responsibility in the eyes of many people. Arguably, he had a role in the situation and thus a moral responsibility, even if he didn't plan for it. On the other hand, he might feel that he's not at fault since they used contraception and the breakup was mutual. But the idea that he can just walk away morally is debatable.\n\nThe ex-girlfriend's actions also matter. She did reach out after the breakup, and he might have been surprised by the contact. However, the fact that she became pregnant after the relationship ended complicates things. She might have known his stance on kids and still chose to become pregnant, possibly even after the breakup. That could be seen as irresponsible, but it's not clear from the story whether she was aware of his stance at the time or if she had any intention of getting pregnant.\n\nThe author's current situation with a new girlfriend and new apartment might influence his stress levels, but it doesn't change the legal or moral obligations. His refusal to pay could be seen as selfish, especially if the mother is struggling financially. However, he's not in a position to force the mother to have an abortion or adoption, which he acknowledges.\n\nIn terms of societal views, many people might see the author as selfish for not wanting to take responsibility for a child he helped create, even if it was unintended. But others might empathize with his position, especially if he clearly communicated his stance on not wanting children. However, once a child is born, societal expectations often shift towards shared responsibility, regardless of the circumstances.\n\nSo putting this together, legally he's in a tight spot because he can't avoid child support once paternity is established. Morally, it's a gray area. Some might argue that he's responsible because he was part of the relationship and the pregnancy, even if it was after the breakup. Others might argue that since he was clear about his stance on not wanting kids and the breakup was months prior, he shouldn't be forced into parenthood. However, the key point is that once a child is born, the father's responsibilities are often considered non-negotiable in society, even if he didn't plan for it. Therefore, the author might be seen as in the wrong for not taking responsibility, making him the asshole (Answer A). But I need to check if there are legal ways to disclaim paternity, which might vary by jurisdiction. If he can legally disprove paternity, then it's different, but the tests say he's the father. So legally, he's obligated. Morally, the answer depends on societal norms, which often lean towards responsibility.\n"
