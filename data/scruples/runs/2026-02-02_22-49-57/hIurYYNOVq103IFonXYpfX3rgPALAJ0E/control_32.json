We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for wanting a financial abortion, meaning he doesn't want any responsibility for the child. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, child support is a legal obligation once paternity is established. Even if the child isn't born yet, once the parent is confirmed, they might be required to provide support. So if he wants to avoid child support, that might not be possible legally. But the question is about being in the wrong morally, not just legally.\n\nMorally, he's arguing that he never wanted children, the relationship ended, and he's not responsible. On the other hand, he contributed to the pregnancy, and the woman is carrying the child. He's being called selfish for not supporting. But he's also in a new relationship and his life has changed. \n\nThe situation is complicated. He's not trying to take the child away, just avoid financial support. Some might see his stance as self-centered because he's not taking responsibility. Others might empathize with his situation, especially if he was clear about not wanting kids. But even if he didn't want kids, the child is a result of their actions. \n\nI should also consider that the woman initiated contact after a breakup, which might have led to this situation. But the responsibility for the pregnancy isn't solely hers. The author might feel it's unfair to be held responsible now. However, societal expectations often place a duty on biological fathers to support their children. \n\nBalancing both sides, the author might be seen as in the wrong because he's choosing to disengage entirely, which could leave the mother in a difficult position. Even if he's not the traditional 'asshole,' there's a moral obligation to support a child you helped create. So the answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong), but there's nuance.\n"
