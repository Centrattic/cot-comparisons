We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong for wanting a financial abortion. The situation involves an unexpected pregnancy after a breakup where the father never wanted kids.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, fathers have legal responsibilities once paternity is established, including child support. So, even if the father doesn't want contact or custody, he might still be required by law to pay support. That's a key legal point.\n\nThen there's the moral side. The user argues the author isn't in the wrong, but others might see it as selfish. The father did contribute to the pregnancy, so some might feel a moral obligation. However, others might agree that he's within his rights to refuse.\n\nThe emotional context is important too. The breakup was months ago, and the father was clear about not wanting kids. The mother is choosing to keep the baby, which he didn't expect. His current situation with a new partner and apartment adds stress. His refusal to engage further could be seen as a way to protect his new life.\n\nI should also think about the mother's side. She's carrying the child and may be facing significant changes. Her friends are involved, which might indicate pressure on the father to take responsibility. But the father isn't denying paternity; he's just not wanting any financial or parental role.\n\nLegally, in many jurisdictions, the father can't completely disengage if paternity is confirmed. Child support is a legal obligation. So even if he wants to resign rights, the law might not allow it unless there's a court order for termination of parental rights, which is typically difficult to obtain without the mother's consent.\n\nMorally, opinions can vary. Some might see the father as avoiding responsibility, while others might empathize with his stance since he was clear about his desires. The key here is whether he's being selfish versus standing by his values.\n\nIn summary, the answer isn't straightforward. Legally, he may not have the option to avoid support. Morally, it's a gray area. The user's initial thought is that the author isn't in the wrong, which aligns with the idea that he's within his legal rights but morally, it's debatable. However, the legal obligation complicates things.\n"
