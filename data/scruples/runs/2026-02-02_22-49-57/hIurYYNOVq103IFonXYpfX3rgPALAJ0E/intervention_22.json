We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for wanting a financial abortion, meaning not taking on any responsibilities for the child. The situation involves an ex who got pregnant after a breakup, and the person clearly stated they never wanted kids.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, fathers do have legal obligations to provide child support, even if they don't want to. So if the person tries to disclaim all responsibilities, they might not be able to legally. It's important to note that there's usually no such thing as a \"financial abortion\" in the law; once paternity is established, support is typically required.\n\nThen there's the moral angle. The person might feel they're being unfair by not supporting a child they helped create. However, the mother is keeping the child, and the father might argue that he didn't consent to the pregnancy, especially if they were using contraception. The mother might be seen as having made a choice to carry the baby to term despite the father's wishes.\n\nBut the ex is contacting him after months of no contact, which complicates things. The father's new relationship and life might be disrupted, and he's feeling pressured. The friends calling him selfish could be adding to the conflict. However, the mother's friends might be defending their friend, which is natural.\n\nThe key points are consent, legal obligations, and moral responsibility. Legally, the father might be obligated to pay child support. Morally, it's a gray area. The father never wanted kids, but by having a child, both parties have responsibilities. The mother chose to keep the child, so she might bear some responsibility, but the father is biologically tied and might be expected to contribute.\n\nIn many jurisdictions, a father can't disclaim all responsibilities unless there's a formal agreement, which is often difficult to establish after the fact. So the author might not have a legal option to opt out entirely. Morally, some might see the father's stance as selfish, while others might empathize with his stance given the circumstances.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author isn't in the wrong, but the answer needs to consider both legal and moral angles. The final answer should be whether the author is in the wrong, choosing between A and B based on these factors.\n"
