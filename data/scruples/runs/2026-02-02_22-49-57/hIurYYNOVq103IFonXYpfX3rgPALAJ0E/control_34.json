We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person in this situation is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The user is asking if they're the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion,\" which means they don't want any responsibility for the child, no child support, custody, or contact.\n\nFirst, the background: They dated a girl for a few months, then broke up, had no contact for months. She gets pregnant and contacts him. He was clear he never wants kids. He refuses to get back together, and now he wants to cut all ties. The child is his, and he's freaked out because he has a new girlfriend and a new apartment. His ex's friends are calling him selfish.\n\nLegally, in many places, fathers do have to provide child support even if they don't want to be involved. So if he just walks away, he might be facing legal consequences. But he's talking about resigning his rights. That's a legal process, right? You can't just walk away; you might need the court to terminate your parental rights. But that's not easy, especially if the mother wants to keep the child. The mother can't force him to be a parent, but he can be forced to pay support. \n\nMorally, it's tricky. He was clear he didn't want kids, but they had sex and used contraception. However, it's not 100% foolproof. He's responsible for the child's existence, even if it was unexpected. On the other hand, he's not ready or willing to be a parent. But by not wanting any responsibility, he's denying the child a father. But is that his choice to make? \n\nThe ex's friends say he's selfish, which is a moral judgment. He might feel that he's not in a position to provide, but legally, he might have to. So if he's trying to avoid all responsibility, he's probably in the wrong legally. But morally, some might say he's being realistic about his inability to be a parent. Others might say that once a child is born, you have a duty regardless of the circumstances. \n\nSo the answer depends on legal and moral perspectives. Legally, he might have to pay child support, so wanting to avoid that is wrong. Morally, it's a gray area, but many would say he has a responsibility. So the answer is probably A, he's in the wrong.\n"
