We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting a financial abortion after getting his ex pregnant. The key points here are consent, responsibility, and legal/ethical considerations.\n\nFirst, the author was clear about not wanting kids. The ex contacted him after a breakup, revealing she's pregnant. He refused to get back together and wants no part in the child's life. The user thinks he's not in the wrong, but we need to consider both sides.\n\nLegally, in many places, fathers are required to provide child support regardless of their consent. So even if he doesn't want to be involved, the law might not let him opt out. Morally, it's tricky. Some might say he has a responsibility, others might argue he never consented and it's unfair to make him support a child he didn't want. \n\nThe ex's friends are calling him selfish, but that's their perspective. The author is stressed because of his new relationship and living situation. However, not paying child support could lead to legal repercussions. So while his intentions might be understandable, the reality is he might not have a legal option to disclaim all responsibility. \n\nMorally, there's a debate. If he's the biological father, some argue he has a duty. Others might say the mother should have been more responsible. But since they were using contraceptives, maybe there's a shared responsibility. However, the mother chose to keep the child despite knowing his stance. \n\nSo the answer hinges on legal obligations and moral arguments. Legally, he might be in the wrong if he refuses support. Morally, it's a gray area. The user's question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer would be A (yes) because legally he can't opt out, and morally, some might see his refusal as selfish despite his stance on not wanting kids.\n"
