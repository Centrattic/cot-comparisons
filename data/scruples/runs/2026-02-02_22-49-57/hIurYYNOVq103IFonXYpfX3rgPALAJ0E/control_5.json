We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is a bit complicated. The user is asking about a situation where someone doesn't want to be a father and is considering a \"financial abortion,\" meaning they don't want any responsibility or contact with the child, not even child support. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the facts. The author dated a girl for a few months, and it was looking like a long-term relationship. Then they broke up and had no contact for months. The girl got pregnant and reached out, but the author was clear he never wanted kids. They had been using contraceptives, so maybe there was a mistake. Now the author is in a new relationship and is stressed about this unexpected situation.\n\nThe author's main argument is that he never wanted children and is not willing to take on the responsibility. He's considering cutting off all ties and not paying child support. The question is whether he's in the wrong morally and legally.\n\nLegally, in many places, fathers do have responsibilities even if they don't want to be involved. Child support is usually mandatory once paternity is established. So the author might not have a legal option to opt out. But he's asking if it's morally okay.\n\nMorally, this is tricky. On one hand, the child didn't choose to be born and might suffer without support. On the other hand, the author wasn't the one who wanted the child. However, he is a biological parent, and some might argue that he has a responsibility regardless of his initial wishes. There's also the aspect of the mother's well-being and the child's future. If he refuses support, it could put more burden on the mother and child.\n\nThe ex's friends are calling him selfish, which adds social pressure. But the author is struggling with his own feelings and current situation with his new partner. The key points here are consent to parenthood, responsibility, and the consequences of his decision on others.\n\nIn some legal systems, you can't disclaim paternity once established. So even if he wants to walk away, he might be legally obligated to provide child support. Morally, opinions vary. Some might say he has a duty to support his child, while others might understand his stance based on his clear prior statements about not wanting kids.\n\nI need to consider if the author is in the wrong. If he's legally required to pay, then he's wrong for trying to avoid that. Morally, it's a gray area. The fact that he was clear about not wanting kids might be a factor, but once a child is born, responsibilities arise regardless of initial desires. So the answer could be that he's in the wrong, especially legally, and maybe morally depending on perspective.\n"
