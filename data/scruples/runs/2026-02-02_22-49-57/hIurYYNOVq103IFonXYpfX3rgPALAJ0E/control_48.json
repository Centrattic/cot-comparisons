We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves an unexpected pregnancy after a breakup, and the author wants to avoid any financial or parental responsibilities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, once a child is born, the father is legally obligated to pay child support, even if they don't want to be involved. So the idea of a \"financial abortion\" might not legally hold up. The author can't just walk away; they might be required by law to support the child. That's a key point.\n\nThen there's the moral or ethical side. The author was clear about not wanting kids, but the child was conceived, and they are the biological father. Arguably, they have a moral responsibility, even if they don't want to be a parent. However, some might argue that if the pregnancy was a result of the breakup and the mother decided to keep the child without the father's consent, the father has the right to disengage.\n\nThe mother's friends are calling him selfish. That's a social judgment, but it's not necessarily aligned with legal rights. The author is in a new relationship and moving to a new place, so the sudden responsibility could be a huge disruption.\n\nAlso, the author mentions they were using contraceptives, but that doesn't eliminate their legal obligation. Contraceptives can fail, but that's part of their risk when engaging in sexual activity. The fact that the mother decided to keep the child complicates things because the father can't be forced to accept custody, but they can still be held financially responsible.\n\nIn some jurisdictions, fathers can disclaim paternity, but that's usually only possible under certain conditions, like if they were unaware of the pregnancy or if the mother didn't take steps to involve them. However, if the mother is actively seeking child support, the court might not allow disclaiming paternity.\n\nSo, the author's main issue is the legal obligation to pay child support. Whether they are in the wrong morally depends on perspective. Legally, they might have to pay, but morally, some might see them as avoiding responsibility, while others might empathize with their stance on not wanting children.\n\nPutting it all together, the author is likely not in the legal wrong but might be considered morally wrong by some. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong. If the answer is based on legal and moral standards, maybe the answer is A (in the wrong) because they have responsibilities they can't opt out of. But if the answer is based on personal choice and rights, maybe B. The original question seems to ask for an AITA (Am I the Asshole) judgment, which usually considers social norms. In that context, even if legally they have to pay, socially they might be seen as selfish, hence A.\n"
