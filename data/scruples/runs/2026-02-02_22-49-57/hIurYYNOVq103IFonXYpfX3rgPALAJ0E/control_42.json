We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is complicated, but I'll start by breaking down the key points.\n\nFirst, the person had a relationship that ended a few months before the pregnancy was discovered. They were clear about not wanting kids. After the breakup, there was no contact. Then the ex reaches out saying she's pregnant. The author is shocked and refuses to reconnect or take responsibility, leading to anger from the ex's friends.\n\nThe author wants to disengage completely\u2014no contact, no child support, no custody. They mention a \"financial abortion,\" which I think refers to cutting off financial responsibility. The question is whether this is morally and legally acceptable.\n\nLegally, in many places, fathers have legal obligations to their children, including child support, even if they don't want custody. So legally, the author might be obligated to pay. But the legal aspect isn't the main question here; it's about moral responsibility.\n\nMoral responsibility is tricky. The author didn't want kids and was clear about that, but they were in a relationship where intimacy occurred. Contraceptives were used, but they failed. The author might feel it's unfair to be held responsible, especially after the relationship ended. However, the argument against them is that they contributed to the pregnancy, so they have a responsibility to the child, regardless of their feelings.\n\nEmotionally, the author is stressed and upset, especially with a new partner and a new home. They might feel overwhelmed. But the ex's friends think the author is being selfish. The author isn't trying to harm the child but wants out of the situation.\n\nI need to consider both perspectives. The author's stance is about personal choice and not wanting to be a parent. The other side is about the child's right to support and the mother's responsibility. However, the mother is keeping the baby, and the father's refusal to support could affect the child's well-being.\n\nLegally, the author might have to pay child support unless they can prove the paternity is uncertain or other factors. Morally, some might say everyone has a responsibility to their offspring, while others might argue that the author's clear stance against children and the breakup's timing make it unfair to hold them responsible.\n\nIn the end, the answer hinges on whether the author is considered morally obligated. If they were in a relationship and contributed to the pregnancy, even after a breakup, they might be seen as responsible. So, the author could be in the wrong from a moral standpoint, but legally it's a different matter. The question is whether they're the asshole, which leans more on moral judgment. So maybe answer A (Yes) because of the responsibility to the child, even if the author feels it's unfair.\n"
