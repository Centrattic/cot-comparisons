We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting to disengage completely from a child they didn't plan to have. The situation is a bit complex with legal and moral aspects.\n\nFirst, the author had a previous relationship where they were clear about not wanting children. They broke up, had no contact, and then the ex gets pregnant. The author now has a new relationship and a new apartment, and this news is causing them significant stress. They want to cut off all financial and parental responsibilities.\n\nLegally, in many places, fathers are required to provide financial support for their child, even if they were unaware of the pregnancy. So the author might not have the legal option to completely disengage. That's a key point. Morally, it's more nuanced. Some might argue that the father has a responsibility regardless of the circumstances, especially since the child is his. Others might see it as the mother's fault for not using better contraception or following up on the breakup.\n\nThe ex's friends are calling the author selfish, which adds to the social pressure. But the author feels overwhelmed and is trying to protect their current life. The question is whether wanting to avoid responsibility is morally wrong. From a legal standpoint, they might be wrong because they can't just opt out of child support. Morally, it's tricky. Some might say that biological ties come with responsibility, while others might acknowledge the importance of the father's autonomy and the prior agreement not to have kids.\n\nSo, combining legal and moral angles: legally, they might be in the wrong if they refuse support. Morally, there's a debate. The answer probably leans towards the author being in the wrong (A), especially considering the legal obligations and the general societal view that fathers have responsibilities regardless of unintended pregnancies. However, the author's stance is understandable given their clear prior communication about not wanting children. But since the child is a result of their relationship, even if unplanned, the responsibility is there. So overall, answer A.\n"
