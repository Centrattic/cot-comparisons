We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for wanting to avoid financial responsibility for a child they didn't want. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, once a paternity test confirms the man is the father, he's legally obligated to pay child support regardless of his wishes. So the idea of a \"financial abortion\" might not hold up legally. The author can't just resign from responsibilities; the court would likely enforce child support.\n\nThen there's the moral side. The author never wanted kids and made that clear, but they were in a relationship where they might have had sexual relations. Even if they were using contraception, it's possible there was a failure. The mother is keeping the child, so the argument is whether the father has a moral duty to support it. Some might say yes, because he's the father, others might side with his stance if he didn't consent.\n\nThe ex's friends are calling him selfish, but the author is also dealing with a new relationship and a new life. The emotional impact is significant for both parties. However, morally, walking away completely might be seen as abandoning the child, which could be considered selfish. But if he didn't want children at all, maybe he's not responsible.\n\nLegally, he can't avoid support if he's the biological father. So even if he wants to, he might not be able to. The question is if he's in the wrong. The answer depends on whether legal obligation equals moral responsibility. If the law says he has to pay, then maybe he's in the wrong if he refuses. But if he's following the law and using court-ordered support, maybe not. But if he's trying to avoid it entirely, he's in the wrong.\n\nThe user says they think the author isn't in the wrong, but the answer needs to be A or B. The legal aspect is key here. Since he can't legally resign from responsibilities, wanting to do so might not make him morally wrong, but the attempt to avoid legal obligations could. The mother is keeping the child, so the father's refusal to support is against the law. Therefore, he's in the wrong. But maybe not if the law can't make him. Wait, the law does require child support, so he's in the wrong if he refuses. So answer A. But the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Hmm. Need to balance legal vs. moral. If he's following the law, he's not wrong. If he's trying to avoid it, he is. The author is seeking a \"financial abortion,\" which isn't a real thing. Legally, he can't do that, so he's in the wrong for wanting to avoid his legal duties. So answer A.\n"
