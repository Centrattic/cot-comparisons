We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person in this situation is in the wrong. Let's see. The scenario is about a guy who had a past relationship where he clearly stated he never wanted kids. They broke up months ago with no contact, and now the ex is pregnant and wants him to support the child. He's refusing to pay child support, doesn't want any contact or custody, and is considering a \"financial abortion\" by disclaiming paternity. His friends are calling him selfish and hurtful.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In many places, if a man is the biological father, he has legal responsibilities, including child support. Even if he doesn't want to be involved, the law might require him to pay. But if he can legally disclaim paternity, maybe that's different. However, I think that if the child is born and he's the biological father, disclaiming might not be straightforward. There's usually a presumption of paternity if he's married to the mother at the time of birth or listed on the birth certificate, but if he's not, he might have to take legal steps to establish or disclaim. Not sure, but maybe the answer is that he can't just walk away legally.\n\nThen there's the moral side. He didn't want kids, the breakup was months ago, but the ex is now pregnant. The user is asking if it's morally okay for him to refuse all responsibility. Some people might say that as a parent, you have a duty, but others might argue that the pregnancy resulted from a past relationship and he's not in a position to be a parent. But the ex and her friends are upset he's not supporting her. His current relationship and new apartment are mentioned, which might imply he's in a better position financially, but he's under stress.\n\nThe key points here: he was clear about not wanting kids, the relationship ended months before the pregnancy. Legally, he might still be responsible unless he can disclaim. Morally, some might see him as selfish, others as respecting his own boundaries. But the ex is keeping the baby, so he can't force an abortion or adoption. However, disclaiming paternity could be possible if proven he wasn't the father, but the tests show he is. So legally, if he's the biological father, can he disclaim? If so, then maybe he's not wrong. But if the law requires support regardless, then he's in the wrong.\n\nAlso, the term \"financial abortion\" is a bit of a misnomer. It's not an abortion, but disclaiming parental responsibility financially. But in many jurisdictions, once you're a biological parent, you can't just walk away from financial responsibilities. So legally, he might be in the wrong. Morally, it's a gray area. The community on Reddit usually leans towards the moral responsibility, even if it's not legal. But the answer here is to say whether he's in the wrong. The question is if he is. The possible answer is A (yes) because he's being selfish, but the legal angle might require it. However, if he's being honest and the child isn't his, but tests say it is, then maybe not. Wait, the user says \"the kid is mine\" so he can't disclaim on that basis. So if he's the biological father, then legally he must pay, so he can't just refuse. Morally, if he's not willing to be a parent, then not contributing financially might be seen as wrong. The ex is keeping the child, which is her right, but he's not in a position to support it. The friends are upset, which adds social pressure. But the user is asking if he's in the wrong. The answer might be A because he's refusing to take responsibility, but some might argue he's not in the wrong if he's being honest. But given that he's the father, it's likely A.\n"
