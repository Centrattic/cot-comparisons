We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The key points are:\n\n1. He had a relationship, then a breakup with months of no contact.\n2. She got pregnant, contacted him, wants him involved.\n3. He was clear he never wants kids, refuses to get back together or take responsibility.\n4. He wants a \"financial abortion\" \u2014 no contact, no support, no custody.\n5. Friends call him selfish, but he's struggling with the situation.\n\nLegally, in most places, fathers do have financial responsibilities once paternity is established. Even if he wants to walk away, the law might not allow that. So he might be legally in the wrong if he doesn't pay child support.\n\nMorally, it's more complex. He was clear about not wanting kids, but if they had sex and contraception failed, he shares some responsibility. But he's also not in a position to support the child and has a new relationship. However, denying child support could harm the child's well-being. On the other hand, if he's not the legal parent and there's a way to relinquish rights, maybe his stance is defensible. But typically, once paternity is established, you can't just walk away from responsibilities.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. Legally, likely yes. Morally, there's a debate. But the user is asking if he's in the wrong, not just legally or morally. The answer depends on the jurisdiction, but generally, I'd lean towards A (he's in the wrong) because legal obligations exist once paternity is confirmed. Even if he didn't want the child, he has responsibilities. However, if there's a legal way to terminate those obligations, maybe not. But the scenario doesn't mention that. So legally, he's probably wrong. Morally, it's a tough call, but the answer is likely A.\n"
