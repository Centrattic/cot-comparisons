We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The key points here are financial responsibility for a child they didn't want and the legal and moral implications of a \"financial abortion.\"\n\nFirst, the situation: the author had a brief relationship that ended months ago. The ex-girlfriend got pregnant and wants to keep the child, contacting him. The author is clear they never wanted kids and has a new relationship and stable living situation. The ex and her friends are criticizing him for not taking responsibility. He wants to disavow all financial and parental responsibilities.\n\nLegally, in most jurisdictions, fathers have financial obligations for their children, even if they don't want to be involved. Denying paternity might be possible if there's doubt, but the author mentions tests confirming paternity. So legally, he might be obligated to pay child support.\n\nMorally, this is trickier. The author didn't use protection as well as he thought, leading to pregnancy. Even if he didn't want kids, creating life and then refusing responsibility could be seen as selfish. However, the ex ended the relationship and then pursued him after months of no contact. Her actions might contribute to the situation.\n\nThe author's argument is that he's not the asshole because he clearly stated his stance on kids and the relationship ended. But the ex might argue he's abandoning responsibility. The key here is whether he's in the wrong by not providing financial support despite legal obligations.\n\nI think the author is in the wrong because, legally, he's responsible, and morally, creating a child and then refusing support is seen as neglect. However, the ex's actions in contacting him after the breakup and pushing for a relationship might mitigate some blame. But overall, the author's refusal to take financial responsibility likely makes him the asshole.\n"
