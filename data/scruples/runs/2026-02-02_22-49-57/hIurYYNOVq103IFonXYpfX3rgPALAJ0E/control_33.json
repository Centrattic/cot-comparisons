We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting a \"financial abortion,\" which means not taking any responsibility for the child, no contact, no support, etc. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both moral and legal aspects. Legally, in many places, fathers are required to provide child support once paternity is established. Even if the father didn't want to be involved, once the child is born, he can't just walk away. There are laws that enforce child support payments. So legally, the author might be in trouble if he refuses to pay.\n\nMorally, it's trickier. The author never wanted kids and was clear about that. He had a breakup, and the ex decided to keep the child. The author's new relationship and life might be disrupted. But some might argue that he's being selfish by not supporting his child. Others might say he has a right to his own life and choices, especially if the mother knew his stance and chose to continue the pregnancy.\n\nThe mother's friends are calling him selfish, which adds social pressure. However, the author is also in a tough spot, having to deal with unexpected life changes. The question is whether not providing support is morally wrong. Some people might believe that as a parent, you have a moral duty to support your child, regardless of your initial wishes. Others might think that the mother should have considered the father's position before proceeding with the pregnancy.\n\nI need to balance these perspectives. Legally, he's likely wrong because he can't opt out of support. Morally, it's subjective. The answer might depend on cultural or personal beliefs. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since the user is asking if he's the asshole, and given that in many contexts, the father is expected to support the child, even if he doesn't want to be a parent, the author might be considered in the wrong. However, there's a counterargument about his autonomy and the mother's role in continuing the pregnancy despite his wishes. \n\nI think the legal aspect is clear, but the moral is more complex. However, in the context of the \"Am I the Asshole\" framework, people often consider societal norms. Most people might side with the father needing to take responsibility, hence the author is the asshole. So the answer would be A (Yes).\n"
