We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation they described. Let me break down the details first.\n\nThe author dated a girl for a few months, and it seemed like it could be a long-term relationship. Then they broke up and there was no contact for months. The girl then comes back saying she's pregnant and wants support. The author is clear they never wanted kids. They refused to get back together, and now are considering a \"financial abortion\" by not paying child support, no contact, etc. The question is whether they're the asshole for wanting this.\n\nFirst, from a legal perspective: In many places, if you're the biological father, you're legally responsible for child support, even if you weren't involved at the time. So the author might not have a legal option to opt out. But laws can vary. Some places might allow termination of parental rights, but that usually requires court approval and there's a process. Also, the mother could potentially seek child support through the courts.\n\nMorally, it's a bit tricky. The author's position is that they never wanted children and the pregnancy was unexpected. They might feel pressured into a responsibility they didn't consent to. But on the other hand, if the author is the father, some might argue that they have a responsibility to support their child. The mother's friends are calling the author selfish, which might indicate societal pressure towards taking responsibility.\n\nThe author mentions they have a new girlfriend and a new apartment, so maybe their current situation makes taking on a child's financial burden difficult. But financial responsibility is part of parenthood, whether wanted or not. The author might be seen as avoiding a duty they have to their child.\n\nHowever, the pregnancy happened after a breakup, so there's ambiguity about consent or knowledge. The author might argue they were deceived into a situation where they became a father without intending to. But if they were the biological father, some would say that's a consequence of the relationship.\n\nI think the key points here are legal responsibility and moral obligation. Legally, the author might be required to pay child support. Morally, people might have different views. Some might say taking responsibility is necessary regardless of wanting the child, others might empathize with the author's situation since they were clear about not wanting kids and the breakup happened.\n\nBut the author is asking if they're the asshole for wanting to opt out. The term \"financial abortion\" here refers to cutting off all financial ties. If the author is legally bound to provide support, then refusing could make them look like they're avoiding responsibility. However, if there's a legal way to terminate parental rights (which is possible in some cases but not easily), they might have a way out. But typically, these rights are hard to terminate without the mother's consent.\n\nAlso, the author's claim that they were using contraception and don't know how it happened\u2014maybe there's a fault there, but that's not clear. The mother could be at fault if she wasn't using the contraception properly. But that's not relevant to the author's responsibility.\n\nIn terms of the mother's friends calling the author selfish, that's a social judgment, but not necessarily a legal one. The author's actions might be seen as morally wrong by some for not taking responsibility, but legally, it depends on the jurisdiction.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author might be in the wrong if they are legally obligated to pay and are refusing. Morally, it's a gray area, but taking the stance that you have no responsibility could be seen as selfish. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
