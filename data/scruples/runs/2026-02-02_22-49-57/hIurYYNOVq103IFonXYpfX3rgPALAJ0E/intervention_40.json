We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong. The main issue here is about parental responsibility and whether the author is justified in not providing financial support for a child they didn't want and were in a past relationship. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, once paternity is established, the father is legally obligated to provide child support. So if the author is trying to avoid that, they might be facing legal consequences. But maybe there's a way to legally relinquish parental rights? I'm not sure how that works. Some states allow termination of parental rights, but that usually requires court approval and proof that the parent is unfit or that the child's best interest is served. If the author is just cutting off contact and not wanting anything to do with the child, that might not be enough. The court might still require them to pay child support regardless.\n\nThen there's the moral angle. The author is clearly against having children and was upfront about it. The ex-girlfriend might have known that, but still continued. The author is now in a new relationship and their life has changed, so they don't want to be involved. But from a moral standpoint, some people might argue that the father has a responsibility to the child, regardless of their past relationship. Others might see the author's position as valid, especially if the child support is a significant burden and the father doesn't want to be a parent.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that they were using contraception. That might affect how people view the situation. If both parties were using contraception, maybe there's a sense of shared responsibility, but the ex still chose to keep the baby. However, even with contraception, there's always a risk of failure, so that might not absolve either party.\n\nThe ex's friends are calling the author selfish, but the author is standing by their decision. The key here is whether the author is being fair and responsible. Legally, they might be required to pay, but morally, opinions could be split. Some might say the author is in the right for not wanting to be a parent, others might say they're in the wrong for not supporting their child.\n\nI need to check if there's a legal way to terminate support. If the author can legally relinquish rights and responsibilities, then maybe they aren't in the wrong. But if they can't, and the court still requires support, then they might be breaking the law. However, the user's question is about being in the wrong morally, not legally. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to weigh both sides.\n\nIn summary, the author's position is about not wanting to be a parent and not wanting financial responsibility. Legally, they might have obligations regardless. Morally, it's a grey area. Some people might support the author's decision, others might think they're avoiding responsibility. The answer might depend on cultural or personal beliefs about parental duty. Since the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, I need to see if there's a strong argument for B.\n"
