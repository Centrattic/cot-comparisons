We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author had a relationship that ended a few months ago. They were clear they never wanted kids. The ex contacted him after being pregnant and wanted to get back together. He refused, made it clear he doesn't want to be a father. Now he's with a new girlfriend, a new apartment, and he's considering a \"financial abortion\" to avoid child support and any responsibilities. His ex and her friends are calling him selfish and hurt, but he's not wanting any part in the child's life. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, let's break down the legal aspects. In many places, once a man is determined to be the father, he's legally responsible for child support. But is there a way to disavow those responsibilities? From what I know, once paternity is established, you can't just walk away. There are legal consequences for not paying child support. So maybe the author is looking for a legal loophole here, but it might not exist. Legally, he might be in a tough spot, but the question is about being in the wrong morally, not just legally.\n\nMorally, this is more subjective. The author was clear about not wanting kids, but they had a sexual relationship where pregnancy was a risk. Even if they used contraceptives, they know that's not 100% foolproof. The ex is now pregnant and wants to keep the child. The author is saying he's not taking responsibility because he never wanted it. But does that make him selfish? Some might argue that contributing to a child's life is a responsibility, even if it's unexpected. Others might say that enforcing a person's right to not have children against their will is important, especially if they were explicit about their stance.\n\nThe author's new relationship and new life might be cited as a reason to not take responsibility, but that's not exactly relevant. The fact remains that he's a parent now, and some would say that comes with certain obligations, regardless of the circumstances. The ex's friends are upset because he's not engaging, but if he wasn't in the relationship anymore and was clear about not wanting kids, maybe he's not at fault for not continuing the relationship.\n\nAlso, the ex is keeping the child, so the author isn't forcing her to abort or give up the child. He's not interfering with her right to keep the baby; he's just not wanting to be involved. That might be seen as morally acceptable if he's not trying to remove the child from her, but he's still responsible financially in many places.\n\nSo, the author might be in a legally obligated position, but morally, it's a gray area. If he's being honest about his stance and not manipulating to avoid responsibility, some people might see him as in the right. Others might see him as shirking responsibilities. The key points are whether he was clear about not wanting kids before, whether he's not interfering with the mother's decision to keep the child, and the legal realities of child support.\n\nI think the answer here is B. The author is not in the wrong. He was clear about his stance on children, and while he has legal obligations, morally, he's not the one who caused the pregnancy intentionally. However, this is a nuanced situation where opinions might differ. Since the question is whether he's in the wrong, and given the context, B seems correct.\n"
