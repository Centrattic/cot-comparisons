We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit-style post is in the wrong. The situation involves an unexpected pregnancy after a breakup. The author is clear they never wanted kids and are now seeking a \"financial abortion\" by cutting off all responsibility. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most places, once paternity is established, men are legally obligated to provide child support. The author can't just resign their rights without going through legal channels. Even if they don't want to be involved, they might still have to pay unless the court agrees to terminate their rights, which isn't easy.\n\nEthically, there's a debate. The author didn't want kids and the pregnancy was a surprise, but they are a parent now. Some might argue that cutting off all contact and refusing support is selfish. Others might see it as respecting their personal choice and not wanting to be a parent. \n\nThe mother's perspective is also important. She wants to keep the child and is seeking support. Her friends are upset with the author, but he's not forcing her to keep the baby. The author isn't trying to stop her from raising the child, just not being involved financially or otherwise.\n\nMorally, it's a tough call. The author is honest about their stance, but the situation is complicated. Legally, they might not have a choice but to pay. So, is he in the wrong? Maybe not in terms of his feelings, but legally he might have obligations. The answer might hinge on the context of the law versus personal ethics. \n\nThe user says they think the author isn't in the wrong. I need to decide if the answer is A or B. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Considering both legal and moral angles, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because he's not forcing the mother to keep the baby and is being honest, even though legally he might still have responsibilities. But ethically, some might see him as selfish. However, the question is about being in the wrong, not about legal obligations. So, in terms of morality, the answer could be B.\n"
