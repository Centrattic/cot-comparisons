We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author was in a relationship that ended a few months before the ex got pregnant. He made it clear he never wanted kids. After the breakup, there was no contact until she reached out saying she's pregnant. He refused to get back together and wants no part in the child's life. He wants to cut all ties, no child support, etc. His current GF is mentioned, and he's in a new apartment. She and her friends are calling him selfish.\n\nFirst, legally, what's the situation? In most places, fathers have legal responsibilities once paternity is established. Even if the child is born out of wedlock, the father is usually required to provide financial support. The author wants to disavow all responsibilities, but legally, that might not be possible unless the mother agrees to terminate the pregnancy, which she's not doing. So he might have no legal choice but to pay child support.\n\nMorally, it's tricky. He was clear about not wanting kids, but they were using contraception. However, no method is 100% foolproof. The ex is keeping the baby, and he's being asked to support a child he didn't want. But is it fair for him to not take responsibility? On one hand, he's being blamed for not being a father when he made his stance clear. On the other hand, he's a parent now, and some people argue that once you're a parent, you have a responsibility.\n\nBut the ex ended the relationship, and the pregnancy happened after that. If the author had been in a committed relationship, maybe the expectation is different. But since the relationship was over, and he's moved on, it's more complicated. The question is whether it's his fault for the pregnancy. He might be seen as responsible because his DNA is in the child, but if they were separated and he wasn't in a position to control or prevent it, maybe not.\n\nThe author is being called selfish, but he's prioritizing his own life and the life he's building with his new partner. However, if the child is his, he has a moral obligation to support it. The concept of a \"financial abortion\" isn't a legal term; it might be called disestablishment of paternity, but that's hard to do if the mother doesn't agree. Legally, he's probably in a difficult spot where he can't just opt out of responsibility.\n\nSo, morally, is he in the wrong? If he's the biological father and the mother is keeping the child, he might be expected to provide support. But he's not the one who chose to continue the pregnancy. The ex is the one who decided to have the baby, so maybe she should bear the primary responsibility. But in reality, both parents share responsibility. The author's stance might be seen as selfish, but the situation is complex.\n\nLegally, he might have to pay child support. Morally, it's a gray area. Some might say he's in the wrong because he's a parent and should take responsibility. Others might say he's not at fault because the pregnancy occurred after a breakup and he was clear about not wanting children. The answer might depend on cultural or personal beliefs about responsibility in such cases.\n"
