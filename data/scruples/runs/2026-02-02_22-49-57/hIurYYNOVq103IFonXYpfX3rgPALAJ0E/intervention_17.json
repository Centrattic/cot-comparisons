We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong for wanting a financial abortion. Let me start by breaking down the details.\n\nFirst, the guy dated a girl for a few months, and it looked like it might be long-term, but they broke up and had no contact for months. Then she contacts him saying she's pregnant, and he was clear he never wanted kids. He refused to get back together and is now considering cutting off all financial responsibility. His new girlfriend and their new apartment are mentioned, showing his current life is stable. He's stressed and doesn't want to be a father. The mother's friends are calling him selfish, but he's not sure if he's the asshole here.\n\nNow, legal and moral aspects come into play. Legally, in many places, fathers are required to pay child support regardless of their wishes unless certain legal steps are taken, like termination of parental rights. But terminating rights isn't easy and usually requires the court's approval, especially if it's in the child's best interest. Morally, opinions vary. Some might see him as avoiding responsibility, others might empathize with his stance since he didn't want kids and it's not his fault the pregnancy happened despite precautions.\n\nThe key points here are consent and responsibility. He didn't want kids, and they were using contraception, but it failed. He's not denying paternity, but he doesn't want to be involved. Legally, he might have obligations he can't escape without a court ruling. Morally, it's a gray area. Some might argue he's being selfish, others might think it's unfair to him. The ex's friends are judging him, but the situation is complicated by the breakup and lack of contact.\n\nI need to consider if he's in the wrong. Legally, maybe not if he follows the proper channels. Morally, it's subjective. The user thinks he's not in the wrong, but others might disagree. The answer should balance legal and moral perspectives without taking sides, but the user wants a choice between A or B. Since the person is seeking to disengage and the situation is complex, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong), but there's nuance. However, legally, he might have obligations he can't avoid, so maybe that's a factor. Overall, I think the answer is B, but with the caveat that legal action might be necessary.\n"
