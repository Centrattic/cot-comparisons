We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for wanting a \"financial abortion,\" which they clarify means not having any contact, child support, custody, etc. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, parental rights and responsibilities are established by law. Even if someone doesn't want to be involved, they might still be legally obligated to provide child support. The user mentions not wanting to pay, so I should check if that's legally permissible. But the user also says they don't want to force the mother to get an abortion or give up the child for adoption, which seems morally neutral.\n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The user is clear they never wanted kids, and the pregnancy happened despite using contraceptives. They didn't get back together with the ex after the breakup, which complicates the situation. The ex's friends are calling them selfish, but the user is prioritizing their own life and their current relationship. \n\nI need to think about consent and responsibility. The user didn't cause the pregnancy on purpose, but they are a biological parent. Do they have a moral responsibility to support the child? Or is the mother solely responsible? This can be a gray area. \n\nAlso, the user's new partner and new apartment are part of their current life they don't want to disrupt. They're stressed and don't want to take on the responsibilities of parenthood. Their refusal might be seen as selfish by others, but they're being honest about their limits.\n\nLegally, in many places, a man can disclaim paternity if certain conditions are met, but it's not always straightforward. The mother's consent might be needed, and the process could vary by jurisdiction. If the user can legally disclaim paternity without the mother's consent, that might be an option. If not, they might be stuck with legal responsibilities regardless of their feelings.\n\nMoral arguments could swing both ways. Some might say that as a parent, you have a duty to your child regardless of wanting the pregnancy. Others might argue that if you didn't consent to the pregnancy and are not involved, you shouldn't be forced into parenthood. \n\nConsidering all this, the user isn't necessarily in the wrong because they didn't want to be a parent and are being honest about their limits. However, the legal side might require them to take responsibility. The answer would depend on local laws, but morally, it's a complex issue where the user's stance is understandable given their circumstances. So, the answer is B.\n"
