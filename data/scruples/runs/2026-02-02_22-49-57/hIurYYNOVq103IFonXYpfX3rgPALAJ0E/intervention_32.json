We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the situation is in the wrong for wanting a financial abortion. First, I need to recall what a financial abortion entails. From what I know, it's when a man doesn't want to be involved in the child's life financially, even if the mother keeps the baby. \n\nThe man was in a relationship that ended, they were using contraception, but she became pregnant. He's clear he doesn't want kids, and after the breakup, they had no contact. Now he's in a new relationship and moving forward. He wants to disassociate completely from the child, no contact, no support. \n\nLegally, in many places, fathers do have child support responsibilities once paternity is established. So if he's legally the father, he can't just opt out. But the mother might have to go through the court to establish that. Morally, it's tricky. He's not the one who wanted the child, and he's been upfront about not wanting kids. But by having sex, there's an assumption of responsibility, even if they used contraception. \n\nThe mother's friends are calling him selfish. But is it fair? He's not the one who decided to keep the baby. He's trying to protect his new life and relationships. The mother had the choice to terminate, but she chose to keep it. So he's not wrong for not wanting to support a child he never wanted. \n\nHowever, there's a counterargument that he's being selfish by not taking responsibility. But since he didn't want the child and wasn't the one to pursue getting back together, maybe he's justified. Also, the mother's actions post-breakup\u2014waiting to contact him and then expecting support\u2014could be seen as a problem. \n\nI need to consider both legal and moral angles. Legally, he might not have a choice if paternity is confirmed. Morally, it's about responsibility versus personal choice. Since he's been clear about not wanting kids and the situation happened after a breakup, he's not in the wrong. So the answer is B.\n"
