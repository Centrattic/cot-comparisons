We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author was in a relationship that ended, and they made their stance clear about not wanting children. The ex then became pregnant and reached out, suggesting getting back together. The author refused, and now wants to avoid any financial or parental responsibilities. The ex's friends are calling the author selfish, and the author is seeking validation on whether they're an asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion.\"\n\nI need to consider both moral and legal aspects here. Legally, in many places, biological fathers are required to provide child support once paternity is established. Even if the author doesn't want custody or contact, they might still be legally obligated to pay. The concept of \"financial abortion\" isn't a recognized legal term, so the author can't just opt out of responsibilities. They might have to go through legal processes to establish or disestablish paternity, but if it's already confirmed through tests, there's not much they can do to avoid it.\n\nMorally, it's more nuanced. The author is in a tough spot because the pregnancy happened despite using contraception. However, they were clear about not wanting kids, so the ex might have known this. Still, the author's refusal to accept any responsibility could be seen as selfish, especially if the child is going to be raised by someone else. On the other hand, the author is also dealing with their own life changes, like a new relationship and moving, which adds to their stress.\n\nThe key points here are consent and responsibility. The author made their stance clear, but once a child is involved, societal and legal expectations often shift. Even if the author didn't want the child, they might still have a responsibility. However, the ex's actions\u2014getting pregnant after a breakup and then expecting financial support\u2014could also be seen as taking advantage. It's a complicated situation where both parties have valid points, but the legal system usually sides with the child's best interest, which includes financial support from both parents.\n\nIn summary, while the author might not be at fault for the pregnancy, their refusal to accept any responsibility could be seen as morally questionable, and legally, they might not have a choice. The answer is likely A, meaning the author is in the wrong.\n"
