We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for wanting a \"financial abortion,\" which I think means not taking any responsibility for the child financially or otherwise.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author had a relationship that ended months ago. They were clear about not wanting kids. The ex got pregnant, reconnected, and wants to get back together. The author says no, doesn't want to be a father. Now the ex is determined to keep the kid, and the author is considering not providing any support.\n\nLegally, in most places, parents are required to provide child support. Even if the author doesn't want custody or contact, they might still have legal obligations. So maybe the author can't just opt out legally. But the question is about being in the wrong morally, not just legally.\n\nMoral perspective: People might argue that as a parent, you have a duty to support your child, regardless of the circumstances. Others might say that the author was explicit about not wanting kids, so the ex should have been more responsible. But the author is also faced with an unexpected situation, and the ex did use contraception. However, no method is 100% foolproof. \n\nThe author's new relationship and new apartment\u2014this could affect their ability to cope, but it's their reality. The ex's friends are calling the author selfish, which is a common judgment in such cases. But is that fair? Well, the author is not being selfish in wanting to avoid responsibility if they didn't intend to have a child. However, society often places the responsibility on the father, even if the pregnancy was unintended.\n\nThe key points here are consent to parenthood. The author didn't consent, but once a child is born, parental rights may be automatic. So the idea of a \"financial abortion\" isn't recognized in most legal systems. The author can't legally disown the child. Morally, it's tricky. Some might see it as the author being realistic about their inability to handle parenthood, while others see it as abandoning responsibility.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The author was clear about not wanting kids, but the ex proceeded despite the breakup. The use of contraception failed, but maybe both parties share responsibility. The author is now in a difficult position, and their response is to avoid all responsibility. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the author might not be in the wrong legally, but morally, there's a gray area. However, the question is whether they are in the wrong here. The answer depends on societal norms. In many cultures, there's an expectation that fathers support their children financially. So even if the author isn't at fault for the pregnancy, they might still be expected to contribute. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author might be seen as in the wrong for refusing all responsibility, even though they didn't want to be a parent. But if the legal system forces them to pay, then morally, they might not be in the wrong if they have no choice. However, the question is about being the asshole, not just legal obligations. The AITA subreddit often leans towards people being expected to take responsibility, so the author might be considered the asshole for not wanting to support the child they fathered, regardless of circumstances.\n\nI think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because they're refusing responsibility for a child they fathered, even if unintentionally. But some may argue B. However, the community's perspective might lean towards A here.\n"
