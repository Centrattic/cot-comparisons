We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about an unexpected pregnancy after a breakup. The author never wanted kids, the relationship ended, they had no contact for months, and then she gets pregnant. He's now in a new relationship and wants to cut all ties, not pay child support, and not be involved.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, once paternity is established, fathers are legally responsible for child support. Even if they don't want to be involved, the law might require them to pay. So the author's desire to avoid financial responsibility might not be legally possible. But the question is about being in the wrong morally, not just legally.\n\nMorally, there's the idea that both parents have responsibilities to a child they helped create. Even if the pregnancy was unintended, some might argue that the father has a duty to support the child financially. Others might say that if both people used contraception and it failed, it's not his fault, and he shouldn't be forced into parenthood against his will. \n\nThe author's stance is that he never wanted kids and is in a new relationship. He's stressed and doesn't want to be part of the child's life. The mother is holding onto the belief that they could get back together, which he clearly rejected. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the mother's emotional response. Her friends are calling him selfish, which adds to the moral judgment. But was he wrong to be clear about his intentions? If he didn't want to be a father, is he morally obligated to support the child? \n\nAnother angle: the use of contraception. They were \"fairly strict\" with it, so maybe it wasn't entirely his fault. But accidents can happen. However, as a parent, one might take responsibility regardless of how the pregnancy occurred. \n\nThe author is seeking a \"financial abortion,\" which is a term for cutting financial ties. Legally, he can't do that if paternity is established. Morally, some might see it as abandonment, others as protecting his own life and new relationship. \n\nI think there's a balance here. Legally, he's probably bound to pay. Morally, opinions might split. But the key is whether he's in the wrong. If he's not the one who wanted the child and was clear about his stance, some might side with him. However, the idea that a parent can disown a child they helped create is controversial. So maybe he's not entirely wrong, but he might not be right either. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nConsidering all this, I think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because he didn't want the child and was upfront, but there's a moral obligation to support the child. However, given the circumstances, maybe he's not in the wrong. The legal part complicates it, but the question is about being in the wrong, not legal consequences. So, I think the answer is B.\n"
