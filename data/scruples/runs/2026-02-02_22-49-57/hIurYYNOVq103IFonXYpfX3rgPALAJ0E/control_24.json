We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a man who is faced with an unexpected pregnancy from a past relationship. He never wanted kids, they broke up months ago, and now the ex is pregnant. He's considering a \"financial abortion,\" meaning he doesn't want any contact, child support, custody, etc.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, fathers do have legal obligations to their children, even if they don't want them. Child support is usually mandatory unless the paternity is challenged, but since he's confirmed as the father through tests, he might have a hard time avoiding that. Legally, he might not be able to just walk away entirely. But maybe there are exceptions, like if the mother is the sole parent and he's not involved. However, the mother might have options for termination or adoption, but she chose to keep the baby. So he can't force her to terminate.\n\nMorally, this is tricky. He didn't want kids and was clear about that. The situation is that they used contraception, but it failed. The ex wants to keep the baby, and he's refusing to be involved. He's in a new relationship and his life has changed. Is it selfish to not take responsibility? Some might say that as a father, you have a duty regardless of the circumstances. Others might argue that he was clear about his intentions and wasn't involved after the breakup. \n\nThe ex's friends are calling him selfish, which adds social pressure. But from his perspective, he's dealing with shock and anxiety. He's also in a new relationship, so maybe he doesn't want to disrupt that. The key points here are legal obligations and moral responsibility. Legally, he might have to pay child support, so he can't just resign all rights easily. But if he can legally terminate parental rights, that might be an option, though it's usually difficult because it's in the child's best interest to have support.\n\nIn some states, if the father voluntarily signs away rights and the mother agrees, it might be possible. But if the mother is dead set on keeping the child, the court might not allow termination of rights. So legally, he might not be able to opt out completely. Morally, it's complex. He didn't cause the pregnancy intentionally, but he is a parent now. However, given the circumstances of the breakup and his clear stance against kids, some might see his position as reasonable. Others would argue that he's responsible now regardless of his initial wishes.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Legally, he might have obligations despite wanting out. Morally, opinions could differ. The question is whether he's in the wrong. If the law requires him to provide support, and he refuses, then he's in violation of the law, which would make him in the wrong. Morally, it's subjective. But the question is whether he's in the wrong, not just legally or morally. If the answer is based on legal and moral standards, the answer could vary. However, since the user is asking in a general sense, maybe the answer is more about whether his actions are justified. Since he's not the one who wanted the pregnancy and was clear about his stance, but is now facing consequences, the community might be split. However, in the context of AITA (Am I the Asshole) forums, often the person is considered the asshole if they refuse to take responsibility for their actions. So maybe the answer is A, he is in the wrong. But I need to check the details again. The user is asking if he's in the wrong. If the law requires him to pay child support, then he is in the wrong if he refuses. However, if he can legally disentangle himself, then maybe not. But given the information, he's not in a position to do that easily. Therefore, the answer might be A.\n"
