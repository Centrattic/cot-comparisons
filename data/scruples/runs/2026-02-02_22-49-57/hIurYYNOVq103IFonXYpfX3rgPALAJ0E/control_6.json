We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong for wanting a financial abortion. The key points here are: he had a past relationship where they were using contraception, they broke up, she got pregnant, he didn't want kids, and now he's refusing any financial or parental responsibilities.\n\nFirst, legally, in most places, fathers are required to provide child support regardless of their willingness. So he can't just opt out of that. But the question is more about moral wrongdoing. He's clear he never wanted kids, and the pregnancy happened after a breakup. The mother is keeping the child, and he's not trying to force an abortion or adoption, just not taking responsibility.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, some might say he's selfish for not supporting a child he helped create. Others might argue that he's not in the wrong if he's not the one choosing to have the child. The mother made the decision to keep it. But he's also not being forced to be a parent; he's just not taking financial responsibility. However, societal norms often place responsibility on the father for child support regardless of the circumstances.\n\nHe's also dealing with trauma and stress, which is understandable. But if he's being asked to be part of the child's life, he's refusing entirely. That could be seen as abandoning responsibility. The mother's friends are calling him selfish, which adds to the social pressure. \n\nSo, considering both legal and moral aspects, he might not be in the wrong legally, but morally, there's a strong argument that he's being selfish by not providing support. Hence, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because he's refusing to take any responsibility for the child he contributed to creating.\n"
