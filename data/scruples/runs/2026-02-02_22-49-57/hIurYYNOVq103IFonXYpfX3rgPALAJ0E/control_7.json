We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting a financial abortion, meaning not taking any responsibility for the child. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the author was in a relationship that ended a few months before the pregnancy. They had no contact until the ex reached out saying she was pregnant. The author had clearly stated they didn't want kids, and the ex wants to keep the child. The author now has a new girlfriend and a new apartment, and they're upset about the situation. They want to cut all ties and not pay child support. The ex's friends are calling the author selfish.\n\nSo, the main points here are: The author didn't want children, the relationship ended, the ex got pregnant, and now the author is against taking responsibility financially. Legally, in many places, even if you don't want to be a parent, you're still legally responsible for child support. Morally, it's a gray area. The author might feel they were wronged, but as a biological parent, there's an argument about responsibility regardless of intent.\n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Legally, they might be, because denying child support can have legal consequences. Morally, some might say they're selfish for not taking responsibility, while others might empathize with their stance given the circumstances. The ex did approach them after a breakup, but the author's refusal to support the child is the key issue here. The fact that the author had previously been clear about not wanting children might be a point in their favor, but it doesn't absolve them of responsibility once a child is involved.\n\nI think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because, regardless of the circumstances, once a child is born, the parent has legal and moral obligations. Wanting to disavow all responsibility seems to ignore that obligation. Even if the pregnancy happened without their consent or knowledge, the child is theirs, so they have a responsibility. However, maybe the legal side varies, but morally, they might be considered selfish for not wanting to support their own child.\n"
