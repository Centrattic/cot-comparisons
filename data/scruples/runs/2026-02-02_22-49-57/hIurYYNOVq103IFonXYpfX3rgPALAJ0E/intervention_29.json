We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong, specifically regarding wanting a \"financial abortion.\" Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe author had a relationship that ended months ago. The ex-girlfriend, now pregnant, wants to get back together, but the author is clear he never wants kids. He refuses to rekindle the relationship and is considering cutting off all financial responsibility for the child. He's worried about his new relationship and living situation. The ex's friends are criticizing him as selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, fathers are legally obligated to provide child support regardless of their willingness. So, the idea of a \"financial abortion\" might not be legally feasible. The author might not be able to renounce his parental rights that easily. But the question isn't just about law; it's also about morality and societal expectations.\n\nMorally, people might argue that the author is responsible because he contributed to the pregnancy. However, the author mentions they used contraceptive methods, which complicates that argument. The ex's friends call him selfish, but does the author have a right to distance himself completely?\n\nIt's also important to consider the context of the breakup. They had been separated for months, and the author clearly communicated his stance on not wanting children. The ex contacting him after the breakup to announce the pregnancy might add to the complexity.\n\nI should check if there's a middle ground. Even if he can't avoid child support, he might have the right to visitation or other legal considerations. But the author is seeking to completely cut ties, which might not be possible. If he wants to disclaim paternity, is that possible legally? In some cases, if there's a voluntary acknowledgment, he could disclaim, but if the DNA test confirms paternity, that might not be an option.\n\nThe author's stance is about not wanting to be involved, which some might see as avoiding responsibility. Others might empathize with his stated desire not to have children. However, society often places the father with responsibility regardless of their initial intentions. The ex's friends' criticism might be harsh, but the author's refusal to support the child financially could be seen as abandoning a duty.\n\nSo, putting it all together: Legally, he might have to pay child support. Morally, some might say he's in the wrong for not taking responsibility, while others might understand his position given his clear communication and the circumstances of the pregnancy. The fact that they were using contraceptives could shift some blame, but not entirely. The author is in a tough spot, but the answer hinges on legal and moral perspectives. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong; I need to decide if that's accurate.\n"
