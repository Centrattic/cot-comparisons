We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's start by breaking down the situation. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting a financial abortion. First, I need to understand what a financial abortion entails. From the context, it seems like the author wants to disclaim any parental responsibilities, including child support, custody, and contact. They don't want to be involved in any way.\n\nThe key points here are the legal and moral aspects. Legally, in many jurisdictions, fathers have certain responsibilities even if they didn't want the child. Once paternity is established, they might be required to pay child support. The author mentions that the mother has confirmed the child is theirs through tests, so legally, he might not have a way out of financial responsibility. So, if he wants to \"resign any rights and responsibilities,\" there might be legal hurdles. He can't just walk away; the court might enforce child support.\n\nMorally, this is trickier. The author was clear about not wanting kids, but the breakup was months prior, and there was no contact. The mother reached out after becoming pregnant. The author argues they were using contraceptives, so maybe there's a sense of betrayal or surprise. However, even with contraception, there's a risk, and the author is now a parent whether they wanted it or not. The mother is keeping the child, so the author's refusal to support could be seen as selfish, especially if they were in a relationship where responsibilities are expected.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of the author's current relationship. They have a new girlfriend and a new life, and this situation is causing them significant stress. They might feel overwhelmed and not ready for parenthood. However, the ethical question is whether someone can morally disclaim a child they didn't want. Some might argue that the child is innocent and deserves support regardless of the circumstances. Others might say the author is being honest about their limitations.\n\nAlso, the mother's perspective is important. She's going through a tough time and is being supported by her friends, who are upset with the author. The author's refusal to acknowledge the child could be hurtful, but he's also in a difficult position. The mother might have known about his stance on children, so there's a question of whether she should have considered that before deciding to keep the child.\n\nIn terms of legal options, the author might need to consult a lawyer to explore if there are any avenues to disclaim paternity, but typically, once a child is born, parental rights are established. The author's best bet might be to work out a legal agreement, but it's unlikely he can completely avoid responsibility. Morally, it's a tough spot, but society often places the burden on both parents to support their child.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is likely in the wrong from both a legal and moral standpoint. Legally, he can't just opt out of financial responsibility. Morally, while he didn't want the child, being a parent comes with responsibilities regardless of intent. The answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
