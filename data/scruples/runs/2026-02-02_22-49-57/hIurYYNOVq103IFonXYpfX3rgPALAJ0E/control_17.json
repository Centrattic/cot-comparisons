We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by breaking down the situation.\n\nThe user is asking if someone is the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion.\" The scenario is that he was in a relationship that ended months ago, and now the ex is pregnant. The user made it clear he never wants kids, they broke up, and then she got pregnant. He's freaked out, doesn't want any part of the child, and wants to cut all financial ties. His new girlfriend and new apartment are mentioned as part of his current life, which this situation is disrupting.\n\nFirst, legally, in most places, fathers have responsibilities even if they don't want to be involved. So he can't just walk away from child support. That part might be a legal issue. But the question is about moral wrong, not just legal.\n\nMoral-wise, people might argue different sides. On one hand, he never wanted kids, and the pregnancy happened after they broke up. But they were in a relationship, and if they were using contraceptives and it failed, maybe he's not entirely at fault. However, once a child is born, there's a societal expectation that both parents contribute. But he's not saying he wants to be a parent, just not financially responsible. \n\nThe ex wants to keep the baby, and her friends are calling him selfish. From a moral standpoint, some might say that he has a responsibility to support the child, regardless of his feelings. Others might say that since he made it clear he didn't want kids and they were separated, he's not at fault. \n\nBut the key points here are: 1) Did he have a responsibility to prevent pregnancy? 2) Is he morally obligated to support a child he didn't want? 3) Is cutting all ties morally acceptable?\n\nThe user used \"financial abortion\" as a term, which isn't a legal term but refers to cutting financial support. Legally, he can't do that, but morally, people might have different opinions. Some might think it's selfish to abandon a child you're responsible for, even if the child is not yours by choice. Others might empathize with his situation given his clear stance on not wanting kids.\n\nAlso, the fact that they were using contraceptives but it failed complicates things. It's not entirely his fault, but he's still a parent now. There's a debate between personal responsibility versus unforeseen circumstances. \n\nIn many cultures, child support is seen as a duty, so morally, he might be seen as the asshole for not supporting the child. On the flip side, if he never wanted children and it's a significant burden, some might argue he's not at fault. However, the fact that he's trying to disengage completely without considering adoption or other options might make people see him as selfish.\n\nThe ex's friends are upset because he's refusing to acknowledge the child. That could imply that society expects some level of involvement. But the user is adamant he can't handle it. \n\nI think the answer hinges on whether the author is considered morally responsible for the child's well-being despite his initial intentions. If society values supporting one's children regardless of circumstances, then he's in the wrong. If personal autonomy and initial wishes are more valued, then maybe not. But given the typical societal norms, the answer might lean towards A (he is in the wrong) because he's choosing to disengage from a responsibility that's generally expected of parents.\n"
