We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for wanting a financial abortion. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe author had a relationship that ended months ago. They were clear that they never wanted kids. The ex contacted them, saying she's pregnant and wants support. The author is against getting back together and wants to avoid any financial responsibility. They have a new girlfriend and a new life, and this situation is causing them a lot of stress. The author is considering a financial abortion, which I think means disclaiming any parental rights and responsibilities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, once you're a biological parent, you can't just disclaim all rights. There's usually a legal obligation to provide child support, even if you don't want custody. The author might not be able to legally avoid financial responsibility, but maybe they can terminate parental rights through a court process, which is possible in some jurisdictions, especially if the mother agrees. However, this can be complicated and might not be allowed unless there are specific circumstances like abuse or neglect.\n\nMorally, this is a grey area. The author was clear about their stance on not wanting kids, so the ex might have known this. However, the author is now facing the consequences. The ex's friends are calling the author selfish, which adds to the social pressure. But the author is also dealing with the stress of an unexpected situation that they didn't plan for and are now being accused of being selfish for not taking responsibility.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, some might argue that the author is responsible because they are the biological father. Others might say that since they were clear about their intentions and the ex chose to keep the child, she should bear the responsibility. However, in most societies, parental responsibility is expected, even if the parent doesn't want to assume it. \n\nThe author's new relationship and stable life are also factors. They might feel that taking on a child would be unfair to both their new partner and the child. But the child's well-being is a consideration too. However, the author isn't refusing to acknowledge paternity, just not wanting to be involved. The ex is the one keeping the child, so maybe the author's main issue is the financial burden.\n\nLegally, if the author can't disclaim parental rights, they might have to pay child support. But if they can terminate rights through legal means, then they might be able to avoid it. But that's a big if. Morally, the author might not be in the wrong for not wanting to be a parent, but they might still have obligations. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's position is understandable given their clear stance and the unexpected nature of the situation. However, legally and morally, there's a case that they do have some responsibilities. But the question is whether they're in the wrong. I think they're not in the wrong because they were clear about their intentions, and the ex chose to proceed with the pregnancy. The author isn't forcing the ex to keep the child but is also not taking on a role they never wanted. So the answer is B.\n"
