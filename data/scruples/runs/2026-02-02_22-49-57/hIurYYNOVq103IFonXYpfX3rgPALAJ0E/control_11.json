We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author dated a girl for a few months, it was looking like a long-term relationship, but they broke up and had no contact for months. Then she contacts him saying she's pregnant. He was clear he never wanted kids. He didn't want to get back together and is now worried about financial responsibility. He's with a new girlfriend, new apartment, and is stressed. He's considering a \"financial abortion,\" meaning no child support, no custody, no contact. He's been called selfish, but he doesn't want to be a father. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should think about legal aspects. In many places, once paternity is established, a father is legally responsible for child support, regardless of relationship status or consent. So the author might not have the option to completely disengage if paternity is confirmed. Legally, he might be required to pay child support unless there's some sort of legal termination of parental rights, which usually requires court involvement and has specific criteria. Just wanting to disengage might not be enough legally.\n\nThen the moral side. The author was clear about not wanting kids, but they were in a relationship where sexual activity likely occurred. The argument could be that both parties have responsibilities. The mother chose to carry the child to term, which the author can't control. But he's arguing he shouldn't have to support a child he didn't want. Morally, some might see him as selfish for not taking responsibility, while others might empathize that he was clear about his stance and shouldn't be forced into parenthood against his will.\n\nThe ex's friends are calling him selfish, but the author points out that he's already in a new relationship and life situation. The key points here are consent to parenthood. If he was explicit about not wanting children, and they were using contraception, maybe there's a shared responsibility. However, the fact that the pregnancy happened despite contraception is a complicating factor. Did he contribute to the situation, or was it an accident? The author is confused about how it happened.\n\nAlso, considering the mother's actions: she ended the relationship, then approached him with the pregnancy. He's refusing to rekindle the relationship, which is his right, but he's also refusing any financial responsibility. Legally, in many jurisdictions, he can't opt out of child support if paternity is established. So trying to avoid that might be legally problematic. Morally, it's a tough call. Some might argue that biological fatherhood entails responsibility regardless of consent, while others might argue that consent to parenthood is necessary and since he never gave it, he shouldn't be forced to pay.\n\nAlso, the term \"financial abortion\" isn't a legal term. It might refer to the idea of avoiding financial responsibility, but legally, that's not how it works. The author might not have a legal avenue to avoid support if he's the father. So the answer might depend on the specific laws where they are, but the question is about whether he's in the wrong morally and if he's in the wrong legally.\n\nOn Reddit, people often argue both sides. Some would say he's in the wrong because he's not taking responsibility for his actions, even if he didn't intend to become a father. Others would say he's not in the wrong because he was clear about his desires and shouldn't be forced into a role he never wanted.\n\nI need to consider if there's any legal way for him to disengage. If there's a legal process to terminate parental rights, which is possible in some cases, but usually requires court action and showing that termination is in the child's best interest, which is a high bar. Without that, he's likely stuck with financial obligations.\n\nSo, the author's desire to avoid financial support might not be legally feasible. Morally, it's a gray area. Some might see him as selfish, others as a victim of circumstances. The main point is that legally, he might be in the wrong if he's avoiding responsibilities that the law requires. Morally, it's more subjective. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong in general, not just legally or morally. Since the community often weighs in on both aspects, but the answer here is A or B.\n\nIn the Reddit context, the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole?) subreddit often has discussions where people are called out for being selfish or not taking responsibility. The common sentiment might lean towards the author being an asshole if he's avoiding support, but others might empathize with his position. However, if he's in the wrong legally by trying to avoid responsibilities, then the answer would be A. If he's not in the wrong because the situation is beyond his control or he's not legally able to disengage, maybe B. But the key is the legal and moral aspects.\n\nI think the answer is A because he's being irresponsible by not taking the financial responsibility, especially if the law requires it. Even if he didn't want the child, once he's the legal father, he's obligated. So trying to avoid that is morally questionable and likely legally problematic. Therefore, the author is in the wrong.\n"
