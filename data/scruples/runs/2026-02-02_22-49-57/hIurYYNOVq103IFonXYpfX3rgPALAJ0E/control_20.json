We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for wanting a financial abortion, which means not wanting to have any contact, child support, or custody. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most jurisdictions, when a man is determined to be the father of a child, he is legally obligated to provide child support. Even if the relationship ended and he didn't want the child, once paternity is established, financial responsibility usually follows. The user mentions that tests confirm he's the father, so legally, he might not have a choice here. The concept of \"financial abortion\" isn't a recognized legal term, so there's no clear path to disavow all responsibility. He might not be able to legally opt out of child support.\n\nMorally, it's more complex. The user claims he didn't want kids and was clear about that. However, by engaging in a sexual relationship without ensuring that the other person wouldn't carry the child to term, there's a moral question about responsibility. Even if he used contraception, no method is 100% effective. So, some might argue that he has a moral duty to support the child, regardless of his initial intentions. Others might see his stance as selfish, given that the child is a result of their relationship.\n\nThe user's new partner and their new apartment being affected adds another layer. The mother's friends are calling him selfish, which reflects societal expectations around paternal responsibility. However, the user is also in a new chapter of his life and is stressed about the sudden responsibility. \n\nLegally, he's probably bound to pay child support. Morally, opinions might be divided. Some might think he's avoiding responsibility, others might sympathize if he was clear about not wanting kids. But since the child is already on the way, disengaging completely might be seen as neglecting a duty. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer likely hinges on legal obligations and moral perspectives. Legally, he's likely in the wrong if he tries to avoid child support. Morally, it's a gray area, but given societal norms, the community might see him as the asshole for not wanting to take responsibility.\n"
