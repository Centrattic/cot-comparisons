We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting a financial abortion, meaning not taking responsibility for the child financially. The scenario is that the author had a relationship, they broke up, then the ex got pregnant. The author was clear they didn't want kids and now wants nothing to do with the child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most places, fathers are legally required to provide child support, even if they don't want to be involved. So the author can't just opt out legally. That's a key point. If the mother takes legal action, he might be forced to pay. So maybe the author is underestimating the legal ramifications here.\n\nThen there's the moral aspect. The user says they think the author isn't in the wrong. But some people might argue that as a biological father, he has a moral responsibility. Others might say that if he was clear about not wanting kids and the mother proceeded despite that, he's not responsible. But wait, the mother is keeping the child, so maybe she's the one making that choice. But the author still has a duty as a parent, even if he doesn't want to be involved. \n\nThe mother's friends are calling him selfish, which is a moral judgment. The author is stressed about his new relationship and living situation. His main argument is that he never wanted children and the situation is beyond his control. But does that absolve him of responsibility?\n\nAlso, the use of contraception failed, which happens, but both parties might share responsibility. However, the mother chose to continue the pregnancy. \n\nLegally and morally, it's complicated. Legally, he can't opt out. Morally, opinions might differ. Some might say he's justified, others not. The question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer options are A or B. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. But I have to decide based on analysis.\n\nThe key factors are: legal obligations can't be avoided, moral responsibility is subjective. If the question is about being in the wrong morally, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), but legally he's not off the hook. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since the options are about being in the wrong, and the user's own view is B, but I need to assess based on the situation.\n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because while he has legal obligations, morally, his stance might be justified given his prior intentions. However, some might argue he's in the wrong for not taking responsibility. But the question is about being in the wrong, and the answer depends on perspective. Since the user's view is B, and I agree that he's not in the wrong morally (though legally he is), the answer would be B.\n"
