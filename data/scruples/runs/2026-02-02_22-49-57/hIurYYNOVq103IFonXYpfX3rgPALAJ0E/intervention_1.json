We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a man who ended a relationship with a woman, and after some time, she tells him she's pregnant. He was clear he doesn't want kids, so he's against getting back together and wants no part in the child's life. He's looking into a \"financial abortion\" to avoid child support and any legal responsibilities.\n\nFirst, I need to consider legal aspects. In many places, once paternity is established, fathers have legal obligations to support their child. Even if the father doesn't want custody or contact, child support is usually mandatory. So legally, he might not be able to completely opt out. But the user is asking about moral responsibility, not just legal.\n\nMorally, this is tricky. The man was upfront about his stance on not wanting kids, but he was involved in a relationship where pregnancy is a possible consequence. Even if they used contraception, it's not 100% foolproof. The mother has the right to keep the child, but the father's responsibility is a point of contention. However, he's now in a new relationship and feels the child isn't his to care for. \n\nThe mother's friends are calling him selfish. That's a common reaction, but does that mean he's in the wrong? The man's autonomy and his clear communication about his desires should be considered. If he didn't plan to be a father and made that known, is it fair to hold him responsible now? On the other hand, he's using this term \"financial abortion,\" which some might see as trying to avoid responsibility without considering the child's needs.\n\nBut the child's rights come into play here. Even if the father doesn't want to be involved, the child has a right to support. The man's refusal could be seen as neglecting that responsibility. However, he's also not the one who chose to carry the pregnancy to term. The mother made that decision. \n\nIn terms of ethics, some might argue that he's not in the wrong because he communicated his stance upfront. Others might say that being involved in a relationship carries inherent responsibilities, even after the relationship ends. It's a balance between personal autonomy and societal expectations.\n\nLegally, he's probably bound to pay child support once paternity is confirmed. Morally, there's a debate. If he's not willing to take on the responsibility of parenthood, maybe he should have been more cautious. But since the method of contraception failed, it's not entirely his fault. The key is that both parties have to consider the potential consequences of their actions in a relationship.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author isn't in the wrong. Considering all angles, I think the answer is B because he made his stance clear, and the mother chose to keep the child. However, legally he might have obligations, but morally, he's not entirely at fault.\n"
