We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the author of the scenario is in the wrong. The question centers around the concept of a \"financial abortion,\" where the author wants to disavow any responsibility for the child, including no child support, no custody, and no contact. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most places, once paternity is established, the father has legal obligations to provide child support. Even if the father doesn't want a relationship with the child, the law typically requires financial support. So legally, the author can't just opt out of child support. That part is clear. So if he wants to resign all rights, that's possible in some jurisdictions, but the court might not allow disclaiming child support. So maybe the author is under a misapprehension about the legal options here.\n\nNext, the moral aspect. The author is a biological father, and the mother is keeping the child. The author never wanted children, but the child is now a reality. From a moral standpoint, some might argue that the father has a responsibility to the child, regardless of his feelings. Others might say that since he's not involved in the child's life and the mother is the one caring for it, he shouldn't be forced to support it financially. However, the mother had a choice too; she could have considered options like adoption. But she chose to keep the child, so the father's responsibility is a point of contention.\n\nThe author's current partner is mentioned, and their new life together is disrupted. The author is clearly stressed and overwhelmed. The mother's friends are criticizing him as selfish. This is a common dynamic in such situations, where the father is blamed for not being supportive, but the mother might also have a responsibility to consider the father's wishes if they were known.\n\nThe author's actions: he rejected getting back together, which is reasonable if he doesn't want to rekindle the relationship. But he's also refusing any financial responsibility. The key here is whether he's aware of the legal implications. Even if he wants to disengage completely, the law may not allow that. So the author might be in denial about what's possible legally.\n\nMoral arguments vary. Some people believe that having a child creates a responsibility, regardless of intent. Others might argue that the mother should have taken precautions to prevent pregnancy if she knew the father's stance. The author did use contraception, but they failed. That's a valid point; using contraception doesn't guarantee 100% effectiveness, so it's not entirely his fault.\n\nIn terms of being an asshole, the author's stance is to avoid all responsibility, which some might see as selfish. However, if the father feels he can't be a parent and the mother is capable, there's a case for the mother's responsibility. The author might be in the wrong if he's avoiding legitimate obligations, but if the law can't force him, perhaps he's not. But morally, the debate is more nuanced.\n\nSo, considering all these points, the author is likely in the wrong because he's trying to disavow all responsibilities that come with being a father. Legally, he can't opt out of child support, and morally, many would argue he has a duty to the child. However, there's a counter-argument that the mother should have considered adoption. But since she's keeping the child, the father's refusal to support is seen as selfish. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
