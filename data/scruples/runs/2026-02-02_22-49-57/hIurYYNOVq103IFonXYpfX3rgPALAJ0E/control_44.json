We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for wanting a \"financial abortion,\" which means not taking any financial or parental responsibility for the child.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, laws regarding child support and parental rights vary. If the child is biologically his, even if he wants to disown the child, he might still have legal obligations. The mother usually has the right to keep the child, and the father might be required to pay child support. However, if he disclaims paternity, there might be legal procedures, but if tests confirm he's the father, he can't just walk away legally. So, legally, he might have to pay child support.\n\nMorally, this is trickier. The man claims he never wanted children and the pregnancy was a surprise. But the child is his, so even if the conception was a mistake, he might feel morally responsible. The mother is determined to keep the child, so cutting off all contact and not supporting it could be seen as selfish. The mother's friends are calling him selfish, which adds to the moral judgment.\n\nHe's in a new relationship and has a new life, which he's worried about. His new partner might not want to take in a child he's financially responsible for. That's a valid concern for him, but it's also a reason to consider the mother's responsibility. However, the mother is the one who chose to keep the child, so he might argue that she should handle it. But he's also in a tough spot because he didn't plan for this.\n\nOn the other hand, the mother might be struggling, and he might have a duty to support the child as the biological father. Even if he doesn't want to be a parent, he might have a moral obligation to support the child financially. However, if he didn't have a relationship with the mother anymore, maybe the mother is responsible. But conception happened when they were a couple or at least in a relationship.\n\nAlso, the use of contraception failing is part of the situation, so both might share responsibility. The fact that he was clear about not wanting kids is part of his defense, but maybe the mother also knew that. If she knew he didn't want kids, maybe she should have been more careful, but that's not a common ethical stance. Usually, even if someone doesn't want kids, the responsibility falls on both parties.\n\nSo, legally, he might be required to pay child support. Morally, people might view him as selfish for not taking responsibility, but he's also in a difficult situation. The key points are legal obligations and moral responsibilities. Since the answer is to choose between A (in the wrong) or B (not in the wrong), I need to decide based on the balance of these factors.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. Legally, he might have to pay, so he can't just disown. Morally, some might see it as selfish, but others might understand his position. The community might be split, but the question is about being in the wrong. The answer could be A if he's legally obligated and morally expected to take responsibility, but B if he's not violating laws or clear moral duties. However, given that he's the biological father, even if he doesn't want to be a parent, he's likely responsible financially. Therefore, he's in the wrong for wanting to avoid that responsibility.\n"
