We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wanting to avoid financial responsibility for a child they didn't want. The situation involves a past relationship where they were clear about not wanting kids, a breakup, and then the ex becomes pregnant. The author is now in a new relationship and doesn't want to be involved, hence the \"financial abortion\" idea.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, fathers have legal obligations for child support once paternity is established. Even if the father didn't want the child, the law often requires financial support. So the author might not be able to legally opt out. But the question is about being in the wrong morally, not just legally.\n\nMorally, it's tricky. On one hand, the author was clear about not wanting kids, and the pregnancy happened despite precautions. On the other hand, once a child is born, they have a right to parental support. Some might argue that the author is responsible because they were a parent, regardless of intent. Others might say that the ex-partner should have taken more responsibility, especially since the author was clear about their stance on kids. The fact that they were using contraceptives might be a point in the author's favor, but no method is 100% foolproof.\n\nThe ex's friends are calling the author selfish, but the author is prioritizing their new life and emotional well-being. The author isn't refusing to acknowledge the child's existence entirely, just not wanting to have contact or financial responsibility. There's a difference between not wanting to be involved and cutting off all support. However, denying child support could be seen as abandoning responsibility.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Legally, they probably can't avoid support, but morally, it's a gray area. The author's actions stem from a place of not wanting to be a parent, which is a personal choice. However, the child's well-being comes into play. The author might be seen as selfish for not supporting a child they helped create. But if the author was transparent about their stance, maybe the ex should have considered that before deciding to keep the baby. The key points are consent, responsibility, and the child's rights. The answer isn't straightforward, but I think the author isn't in the wrong morally, even if they are legally obligated. So the answer would be B.\n"
