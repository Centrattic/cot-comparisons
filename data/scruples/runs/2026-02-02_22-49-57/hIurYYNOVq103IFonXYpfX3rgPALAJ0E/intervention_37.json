We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through their situation carefully.\n\nThey were in a relationship that was heading towards being long-term, but then they broke up and had no contact for months. The ex-girlfriend comes back saying she's pregnant and wants support. The author is clear they never wanted kids, which is a big deal for them. They rejected getting back together and now are considering a \"financial abortion\" to avoid any responsibility. The new girlfriend is part of their new life, and the author is really stressed about this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, child support is a legal obligation once paternity is established. The author might not be able to just walk away from financial responsibility. But maybe they can contest paternity if there's uncertainty, but the tests confirmed it's theirs. Legally, the author might be forced to pay child support regardless of their feelings.\n\nMorally, it's tricky. The author didn't want kids and made that clear, but the ex didn't get pregnant intentionally? Wait, the author says they used contraceptives strictly, but that might not be the case. If the ex was on birth control and failed, or if there was a mistake, maybe both parties share some responsibility. But the author is now trying to avoid all responsibility. The ex's friends are calling them selfish, which makes me think the author is being seen as not taking responsibility. However, the author is clear that they don't want a child and are in a new relationship. Is it fair to make them support a child they never wanted?\n\nI think the key points are the legal obligations they can't escape and the moral responsibility. Even if they don't want the child, they are biologically responsible. Legally, they have to pay child support, which makes the \"financial abortion\" impossible. Morally, some might argue they should take responsibility, others might empathize with their stance. But the author is in a difficult spot. However, the fact that they rejected the mother's request to reconcile might have contributed to the situation. But the core issue is the child support. Since they can't legally avoid it, maybe the author isn't in the wrong for wanting to, but they are in a legally binding situation. The answer depends on legal and moral perspectives. The question is whether they are in the wrong. The author might not be in the wrong morally for not wanting a kid, but legally they are obligated. The original question is if the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A or B. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to decide based on the context. The author is stuck with legal obligations, but morally, they might not be wrong for not wanting to be a parent. So the answer is B.\n"
