We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the question is whether the person is in the wrong for wanting a financial abortion. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe user was in a relationship that ended a few months ago. They were clear they didn't want kids. The ex got pregnant, and now wants him involved. He's really against it, doesn't want to be a dad, and wants no responsibility. He's with a new girlfriend, moved into a new apartment, and this news is causing him a lot of stress. He's considering a \"financial abortion,\" which I think means not paying child support or having any legal responsibilities.\n\nFirst, legally, in many places, fathers are required to provide financial support for their children, regardless of their consent. So even if he doesn't want to be involved, he might have to pay child support. That's a legal aspect to consider. But the question is about morality and whether he's in the wrong.\n\nMoral standpoint: He didn't want kids, was clear about it. The ex continued the pregnancy against his wishes. He's not the one who decided to keep the baby; she did. So morally, is he responsible? Some might say yes because he's the father, biologically, so he has some responsibility. Others might argue that since he was clear about not wanting kids and the pregnancy happened despite precautions, he shouldn't be forced to take responsibility.\n\nBut then, there's the argument that once a child is born, the father has some obligation regardless of the circumstances. Even if the pregnancy was a surprise, the child now exists and needs care. So refusing all responsibility could be seen as selfish.\n\nAlso, the ex's friends are calling him selfish. That might be on them, but maybe there's some merit if he's choosing not to support his own child. The user is in a new relationship, which adds stress. But the new GF's situation might not be relevant here.\n\nLegally, he can't avoid child support if the court orders it. Morally, it's a gray area. He didn't want the child, but now that it's coming, he's responsible. The ex isn't forcing him to be a parent, just to support financially. So maybe he's in the wrong for refusing to support his own child. But if the pregnancy happened without his consent and he was clear about not wanting kids, is that the ex's fault?\n\nI think the key points are: he was explicit about not wanting kids, the pregnancy happened without his knowledge, and he's not willing to take on responsibilities. But once the child is born, he has a legal and moral responsibility. So he might be in the wrong for not wanting to support the child. However, the situation is complicated because he wasn't expecting this and is in a new relationship. But the main issue is the child's well-being. So the answer might lean towards him being the asshole because he's refusing to support his own child, even if he didn't want to be a father.\n"
