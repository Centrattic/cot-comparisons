We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy who had a past relationship where they broke up months ago. The ex then got pregnant and contacted him. He never wanted kids, and he's clear about that. He doesn't want to get back together, doesn't want responsibility for the child, and wants to avoid financial support. His ex and her friends are criticizing him as selfish.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In many places, if you're the biological father, you might have legal responsibilities, like child support, even if you don't want custody. But can he legally disclaim paternity? That depends on the jurisdiction. Maybe if there's a legal process to establish that he's not the father, but the tests show he is. So legally, he might have to pay child support. If he wants to terminate parental rights, there are procedures for that, but usually require court involvement and sometimes the consent of the mother. If she wants to keep the child, he can't unilaterally stop support.\n\nMorally, it's more complex. He's against kids in general, but the pregnancy happened. He's in a new relationship and new apartment, so maybe he feels unprepared. But the mother might argue that he's responsible since it's his child. The fact that they used contraceptives but it still happened\u2014maybe that's a point, but both parties are responsible. However, once the child is born, denying support could be seen as selfish. But he's not forcing her to have the baby; he's just not wanting to be involved financially. \n\nThe user is asking if he's the asshole. The ex and her friends think he is, calling him selfish. But if he's legally required to pay, then refusing could be seen as not taking responsibility. On the other hand, if he didn't want kids and it's a surprise pregnancy, maybe he's not the only one at fault. The mother also chose to keep the child. \n\nI think the answer here might be that he's not in the wrong legally if there's a way to terminate parental rights, but morally, it's a gray area. However, since the question is about being an asshole, the community might side with him because he's taking a stand on his personal choice, even if it's difficult. But others might argue he's being selfish. In AITA posts, often people are called out if they act without considering others, but here he's trying to protect his own situation. Hmm. It's a tough call. The answer could be B (not in the wrong) because he's not forcing her to have the baby, just not wanting to be financially responsible. But maybe the legal obligation complicates that. I need to check if in the legal context, he can avoid support. If he can't, then maybe he's not in the wrong morally but legally has to pay. But the question is about being an asshole. If he's not being cruel or malicious, just making a hard choice, maybe he's not the asshole. So I think the answer is B.\n"
