We basically went a few months with no contact, until she contacted me, saying she was a few months pregnant and needed my support. I was floored. We'd barely spoken since the breakup, and I was clear as day about the fact that I NEVER wanted kids. \n\nThis was one of the worst things that could conceivably happen to me. She suggested getting back together, which I shut down right out of the gate. I explained that we were through months ago, and that I don't want to be a father, and hung up. She is dead set on keeping it, there have been tests, and the kid is mine, though I dont know how the fuck it happened, since we were fairly strict with contraceptives.\n\nI have a new GF, and we've just moved to a great new apartment. This phonecall literally shook me to my core, and I am freaking out like crazy. I've been searching for every possible way out, and I heard of a financial abortion, or whatever its called. Basically I want to resign any rights and responsibilities for the kid, since I never wanted him/her to begin with. I refuse to pay out the ass for a kid I don't want, and I obviously won't and can't force the mother to get rid of the baby, or give it up for adoption.\n\nHer friends have called me, saying that I really hurt her by refusing to acknowledge this kid, and calling me selfish and whatnot, but I can't handle all that stuff right now, or ever probably. Am I the asshole for wanting a \"financial abortion\", that is, no contact, no child support, no custody, and is it morally and legally okay???\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for wanting a financial abortion, meaning they don't want any responsibility for the child. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the legal aspects. In most places, when you're a biological parent, you have legal obligations, including child support. So if the author is trying to disclaim all responsibility, that's probably not possible. The mother can take them to court for child support, and they might have to pay regardless of their feelings. Legally, they might be in a tough spot here.\n\nNext, the moral side. The author made it clear they didn't want kids, and the breakup was months ago. The mother is choosing to keep the child, so the question is whether the author is morally obligated to support a child they didn't want. Some might argue that since the child exists, the responsibility is shared, but others might see it as unfair to the author. However, there's also the argument that contributing to someone's well-being is a moral duty once you've created a life.\n\nThen there's the situation of the author's current life with their new partner and new apartment. They're stressed and feel blindsided. The mother's friends are calling them selfish, but the author is standing by their decision. It's a complex emotional situation. \n\nBut legally, can they just walk away? Probably not. Most jurisdictions require child support. So the author can't just disclaim all responsibility. That might mean the author is legally in the wrong if they refuse to pay, but morally, it's debatable. \n\nThe user says they think the author isn't in the wrong. But I need to check if the author's actions are legally permissible. If the answer is about being in the wrong, both legally and morally, then maybe the answer is A or B. But the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, not just legally. Since the user is asking for a personal opinion, the answer would depend on whether the author's refusal to pay is morally acceptable. However, the legal aspect complicates things. \n\nIn conclusion, the author might not be morally wrong because they had already made their stance clear about not wanting children, but legally, they are likely obligated. The question is whether being in the wrong is about morality or law. Since the user is asking if the author is in the wrong, and considering both aspects, I think the answer is B (not in the wrong) but with the caveat that they might still have legal obligations. However, the community might see the author as selfish, but legally, they can't opt out. Since the question is about being in the wrong in a general sense, probably B.\n"
