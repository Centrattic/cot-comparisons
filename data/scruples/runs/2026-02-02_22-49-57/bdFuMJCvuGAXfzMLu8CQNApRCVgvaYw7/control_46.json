I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple living in a studio apartment where the wife wants some alone time, so she asks her husband to leave for a few hours. The husband gets hurt and feels unwelcome, even though he's home a lot. The wife values her alone time and has always loved living alone. They can't move to a bigger place because of financial issues.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the wife is in the wrong. The key points are the need for personal space versus the husband's feelings. In a studio apartment, there's limited space, which can make constant togetherness challenging. The wife has a valid reason for needing alone time to decompress, read, or watch shows without feeling observed. It's reasonable for someone to seek a few hours of privacy, especially after working full-time.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband's reaction might be a sign that he's not comfortable with the request, possibly feeling that his presence is being rejected. He might be struggling with the adjustment from living alone to sharing a small space. His response of feeling unwelcome and wanting specifics about the time could indicate insecurity or a need for more validation. However, that doesn't necessarily mean the wife is wrong. People have different needs for personal space, and it's a common issue in close living quarters.\n\nThe wife isn't asking for the entire weekend; she's just seeking a couple of hours. The husband's availability is high, so the logistics might not be the issue. The core problem seems to be communication and mutual understanding of each other's needs. The wife isn't being unreasonable; she's expressing her need without making it a demand, but the husband's emotional response complicates things.\n\nFinancial constraints prevent moving, so they have to work through this. The wife's request is about a temporary solution to a personal need, not a permanent problem. The husband might need to find alternative ways to spend time alone or with friends, which he hasn't done effectively. The wife isn't in the wrong because her need for privacy is valid, and the husband's reaction might stem from deeper issues that need addressing through communication rather than assigning blame.\n"
