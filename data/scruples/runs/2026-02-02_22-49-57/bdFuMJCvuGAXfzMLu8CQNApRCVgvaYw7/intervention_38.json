I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. They live in a studio apartment, which is small and doesn't have much personal space. The author works full time, and the husband works only 10-20 hours a week. The husband doesn't go out much or meet friends. The author wants some alone time, so she asks him to leave for a couple of hours. But when she does, he gets hurt and feels unwelcome. The author values alone time, having previously lived alone. They can't move to a bigger place yet because of financial issues.\n\nSo, the author's request is for personal space, which is reasonable. The husband's reaction seems to be about feeling rejected or not included. The problem here is communication and differing needs. The author isn't being selfish; she's asking for something that's important for her well-being. The husband's issue might be more about his feelings of insecurity or not feeling at home. \n\nThe key points are: The author has a legitimate need for alone time, especially given the living situation. The husband's job and social habits mean he's home a lot, but that doesn't negate the author's need. The husband's reaction is emotional, but that doesn't make the author wrong. The author is trying to balance their lives, and the husband's response is about feeling unwelcome, but the author isn't keeping him out all the time, just a couple of hours on certain days.\n\nFinancial constraints prevent moving, so the author can't just solve the problem by moving. It's a realistic situation. The husband's friends are busy, so he might not have many options, but the author isn't forcing him to go out with friends\u2014just to leave for a few hours. The husband's response seems to be about the principle of being asked to leave, not the specific method.\n\nIn relationships, both partners need to have their needs respected. The author is communicating her need, which is valid. The husband needs to address his feelings and find ways to manage his time or social interactions. The author isn't wrong for asking for her space. So, the answer should be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
