I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation (the author) is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. The author lives in a studio apartment with their husband, which means they don't have much alone time. The husband works part-time and doesn't go out much, so when the author asks him to leave for a few hours to have some alone time, he gets hurt and feels unwelcome. The author feels that the husband has plenty of free time and doesn't understand his reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their living situation. A studio apartment is small, and with both people being home a lot, especially since the husband's work hours are limited, it's reasonable for the author to want some personal space. The fact that the husband is home alone on other days (like Friday and Monday) suggests that he does have time alone, but he's not using it to go out or meet friends. The author's request for a couple of hours alone isn't unreasonable given the lack of space.\n\nNext, the husband's reaction. He's feeling hurt and not welcomed, which is a red flag. If he's not using his free time to socialize or find activities, then maybe he needs to take responsibility for that. The author is just asking for some time to have the space they need, which is a valid need. The husband's response seems to be more about his feelings of being excluded rather than the practical aspect of needing time alone. \n\nThe author isn't being inconsiderate; they're acknowledging the husband's presence and even offering that he doesn't have to do anything specific, just leave for a few hours. The husband's insistence on knowing exact hours and his friends' availability might be an overreaction. The author is balancing their own needs with the husband's schedule, and it's a common issue in close living quarters.\n\nConsidering the financial situation, they can't move yet, so the author is stuck in the current setup. It's understandable that they want to maintain their mental health by having some alone time. The husband's reaction might stem from insecurity or not feeling included, but the author's request is reasonable. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't wrong for wanting some alone time in their own home. The husband's hurt feelings might be valid, but the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries to maintain their well-being. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
