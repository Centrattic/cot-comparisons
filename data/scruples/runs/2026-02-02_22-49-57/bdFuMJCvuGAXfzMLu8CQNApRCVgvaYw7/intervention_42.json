I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original post (OP) is in the wrong for asking her husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. \n\nFirst, the situation: They live in a studio apartment, so space is limited. The OP works full-time, her husband works part-time (10-20 hours/week). She wants some alone time, which he doesn't provide, leading to tension. The husband feels hurt and not welcome when she asks him to leave. They can't afford a bigger place due to financial instability.\n\nKey points to consider:\n1. **Need for personal space**: Living in a studio apartment with someone means less privacy. The OP values alone time, which is a valid human need. It's not unreasonable to want a few hours to herself.\n2. **Husband's reaction**: He's hurt and feels unwelcome. That's emotional, but his job situation is stable? Wait, no\u2014he works part-time and his job isn't stable. Maybe he's home a lot because of limited hours, leading to more time together. But he doesn't socialize much, so maybe he's feeling cabin fever?\n3. **Communication issues**: The husband is asking for specifics (how many hours she needs, what he should do). This might indicate he's not just upset about the time but perhaps feels his needs aren't being considered. He might want more assurance that he's valued in the home.\n4. **Financial constraints**: They can't move to a bigger apartment yet because of his unstable job and high city costs. So the problem isn't easily solved by changing the living situation.\n5. **Alternatives**: The OP suggests he can go out alone or meet friends. He doesn't do that often, so maybe he's reluctant. It's possible he doesn't have the social connections or the desire to spend time away from home, but he's not working enough to be out. However, that's his choice, not the OP's fault.\n\nIs the OP wrong? She's advocating for her own needs, which is reasonable. The husband's reaction is about feeling unappreciated, but the OP isn't at fault for needing space. The problem seems more about the husband's emotional response and possibly his own lack of initiative to find activities. The OP isn't being selfish; she's making a reasonable request given the circumstances. The husband's feelings are valid, but that doesn't make the OP wrong. The root issue might be a lack of communication or understanding of each other's needs. So the answer would be B (Not in the wrong).\n"
