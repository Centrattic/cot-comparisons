I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for asking her husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. The situation involves them living in a studio apartment, which doesn't offer much privacy. The husband works part-time and stays home a lot, so the author wants some alone time but feels like she can't get it with him around. When she asks him to leave, he gets upset and feels unwelcome. They're also not in a position to move due to financial reasons.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author values her alone time and has a valid need for it, especially since they live in a small space with no kids. It's reasonable to want personal space. On the other hand, the husband might feel that his presence is being rejected, especially if he's not used to being in the apartment or if he's sensitive about his role in the household. His reaction seems to be more about feeling unwelcome rather than the actual request for time alone.\n\nThe key points here are mutual understanding and communication. The author isn't asking for the entire weekend; just a couple of hours on a Saturday. The husband's response, however, seems to overreact and generalize it to not having a relaxing weekend. The author's reasons are practical and reasonable, and the husband's job situation isn't stable, so moving isn't an option right now. \n\nAlso, the husband's work hours are limited, so he has more time at home. The author's request for alone time isn't unreasonable, especially since she's the one working full-time. It's about balancing both partners' needs. The husband might need to find other ways to spend his time or engage in activities independently, which is a common part of relationships. The problem might stem from communication issues rather than the request itself. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? I don't think so. She's asserting her need for personal time, which is a common and healthy aspect in relationships. The husband's reaction is more about how he perceives the request rather than the request being inherently wrong. The issue lies more in their communication and how they address each other's needs, not necessarily the author's actions. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
