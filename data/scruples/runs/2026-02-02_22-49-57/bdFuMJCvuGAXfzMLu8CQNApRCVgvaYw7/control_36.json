I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for asking her husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. They live in a studio apartment, which means no privacy. She works full-time, and he works part-time (10-20 hours a week), so he's home a lot. She wants some alone time, so she asks him to leave. But when she does, he gets hurt and feels like it's not his home. She's been asking him to meet friends or go out, but he's not doing that often. She's also considering moving to a bigger place but can't because of financial issues.\n\nNow, the key points here are about personal space and mutual understanding. She's valuing her alone time, which is understandable. But he's feeling rejected or unwelcome when she asks him to leave. He's not working much, so maybe he's feeling like he's not contributing or is isolated. The husband's reaction might stem from insecurity or a need for validation.\n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, asking for personal space isn't inherently wrong. Everyone needs some time to themselves. But how it's communicated matters. If she's not considering his feelings or the reason he's not going out (maybe he's lonely or stressed), that could be an issue. But the problem seems more about mismatched needs. She needs alone time, he needs to feel included and part of the home. \n\nThe fact that he's not socializing much and gets hurt when asked to leave might indicate he's struggling with his own issues, like social anxiety or low self-esteem. She's trying to balance her needs with his, but it's a common conflict in relationships. Since she's not being unreasonable (a couple of hours) and he's not meeting friends often, maybe the husband's reaction is overblown. However, she could be more sensitive about her requests and check in with him. \n\nBut in the scenario, she's explaining her reasons clearly, and the husband is the one getting hurt. The user is asking if she's wrong. Since both have valid needs, but she's not being inconsiderate, maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong). The main issue is communication and both needing to find a middle ground, but she's not the one at fault here.\n"
