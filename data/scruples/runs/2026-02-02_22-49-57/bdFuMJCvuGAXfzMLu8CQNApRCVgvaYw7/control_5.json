I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for asking her husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. They live in a studio apartment, which is pretty tight. She works full-time, he works part-time, and he's home a lot. She wants some alone time but feels guilty when she asks him to leave. He gets hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome. They can't move to a bigger place yet because of financial issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author wants personal space, which is valid. Many people need alone time to recharge. The husband feels that if she wants him out, it means he's not welcome in their home. That's a hurtful feeling, especially for someone who's already working less hours and might feel like he's not as busy. He's probably feeling insecure or unappreciated.\n\nBut the problem is the communication. The author is asking him to leave, which might come across as pushing him out. Maybe she should have tried other ways to create space without him leaving. But on the other hand, she's been clear that she values alone time, and he's not meeting her needs. The husband's reaction is emotional, which complicates things. He's not being unreasonable in wanting to feel included and part of the home.\n\nThe fact that they can't move yet adds to the tension. They're in a studio apartment because of financial constraints. The husband's job is unstable, so he's not contributing as much, which might make him feel even more like he's not part of the household. The author might not realize how her requests affect him emotionally. However, her need for alone time is also understandable. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, both might have some role. The author could try to communicate better, maybe set aside specific times when they both can have space or find activities they can do separately within the apartment. The husband might need to take initiative to find things to do on his own, but if he's not meeting friends or going out much, that's on him too. So maybe the author isn't entirely wrong, but there's room for both to adjust. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since she's asking for space, which is a basic need, and he's overreacting, maybe she's not in the wrong. The answer might be B (No).\n"
