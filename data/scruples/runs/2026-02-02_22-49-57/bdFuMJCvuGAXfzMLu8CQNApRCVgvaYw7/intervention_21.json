I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is wrong for asking her husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThey live in a studio apartment, which is small, so no privacy. She works full time, and he works part-time. She wants some alone time because she prefers living alone and values personal space. When she asks him to leave, he feels hurt and doesn't feel welcome. He also mentions that he's home alone on other days, like Friday and Monday, but she thinks he has plenty of free time. They can't move to a bigger place because of financial issues.\n\nFirst, I should consider her perspective. She's in a small space, working full time, and needs some time to herself. It's understandable that she wants alone time, especially if that's what she's used to. Her request seems normal\u2014everyone needs personal space sometimes.\n\nThen there's her husband's reaction. He feels that when she asks him to leave, it implies he's not welcome in their home. He might be feeling rejected or unappreciated. His job situation is unstable, so maybe he's already feeling insecure about contributing financially, which could be affecting his emotional response. Also, if he doesn't have friends to hang out with, being asked to leave might be difficult for him socially.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual understanding. She's asking for a couple of hours to herself, which isn't unreasonable. However, the way he reacts suggests there's an emotional component. It might help if they can talk about underlying issues, like his feelings of not belonging, or his social activities. Maybe she could explore other ways to get alone time without him leaving, like setting specific times when they don't interact, or creating a small space he can use separately in the apartment.\n\nBut the question is whether she's wrong. From a basic human need standpoint, needing alone time isn't wrong. She's not making a demand that's excessive. However, the issue might be in how the request is communicated or his interpretation of it. If she could frame it more as wanting time to recharge rather than him needing to leave, maybe he'd feel less rejected. Still, the core of her needing time to herself is valid. So I think she's not in the wrong. The problem is more about their communication and his emotional response, not her initial request.\n"
