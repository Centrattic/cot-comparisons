I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author of the situation described is in the wrong. Let me read through the scenario again carefully.\n\nThe author is a woman who lives in a studio apartment with her husband. They both work, but she works full-time and he works 10-20 hours a week. She wants some alone time because the studio apartment gives them no privacy. When she asks him to leave for a few hours, he gets hurt and questions what she wants him to do. He also feels like he can't relax if he's not home on weekends, even though he's home alone on other days like Friday and Monday. They can't move to a bigger apartment yet due to financial instability.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is asking for personal space, which is a valid need. People often require alone time to decompress, especially after a full-time job. The husband, on the other hand, might feel that his presence is a given and that being asked to leave implies he's a burden. His job situation is part-time, so maybe he's home more and feels the home is his base. His hurt feelings might stem from feeling unappreciated or excluded.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual understanding. The author isn't asking for a lot\u2014just a couple of hours. The husband's reaction seems to be about feeling unwelcome rather than the time itself. However, the author has a right to her space, especially in a living situation where physical separation isn't possible. The fact that they can't move due to financial reasons adds stress as well.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because seeking alone time is reasonable. The issue might be more about how the request is communicated and the husband's emotional response. If both sides can work on communication, understanding each other's needs, it's a common problem in close living situations. So, the answer should be B (No).\n"
