I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. They live in a studio apartment, so space is limited. The author wants some alone time, which they value a lot. The husband works fewer hours and isn't out much, which the author points out. When the author asks him to leave, he gets hurt and feels unwelcome. The user is asking if the author is at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's need for alone time is valid. Living in a studio apartment with someone else can lead to a lack of personal space, especially if you're used to living alone. The author works full-time, so having a few hours to themselves on the weekend isn't unreasonable. They're not asking for something extreme, just a couple of hours on a Saturday afternoon.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband seems to be taking it personally. He feels like the apartment isn't his home yet, which might be a red flag. If he's not used to the environment, maybe he's not adjusting well. But the author is the one who initiated the situation. However, the husband's reaction might be an overreaction. He's supposed to be there for the author, and if she needs time to herself, it's part of maintaining a healthy relationship. The husband's job situation is unstable, but that shouldn't mean he can't find things to do when he's not working. The fact that he's home most of the time and doesn't have friends to meet might be a separate issue.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the husband is home alone on other days, like Friday and Monday. So the request is just for a couple of hours on Saturday. The husband's response that he can't relax without those hours might be an overgeneralization. The author isn't asking for a lot, and the husband's feelings of not being welcome could be a communication problem on his part.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author isn't wrong for wanting time to herself. It's important for personal well-being. The husband's reaction is problematic, but that doesn't mean the author is at fault. The key here is that the author is setting a boundary for her own mental health, which is reasonable. The husband needs to find ways to be okay with her needing time alone, but that doesn't mean the author is in the wrong for asking.\n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
