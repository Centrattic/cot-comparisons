I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. The situation involves them living in a studio apartment, which offers no privacy. The author works full-time, while the husband works part-time and spends most of his time at home. The husband feels hurt when she asks him to leave so she can have some alone time, and he perceives it as not being welcome in his own home. The author is trying to balance their need for personal space with her husband's feelings.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their living situation. A studio apartment is a small space, and with both partners being home frequently, it's natural for the author to desire some alone time. The fact that the husband works fewer hours might mean he's home more, which could contribute to the lack of privacy. The key points here are the author's need for personal space versus the husband's feelings of being excluded.\n\nThe husband's reaction is also important. When she asks him to leave for a few hours, he becomes hurt and questions the exact amount of time and activities he should do. This suggests he might feel that the requests are inconsistent or that he's not being considered. His comment about not having a relaxing weekend if he can't stay home on Saturday implies he might feel his needs aren't being met either. However, the author points out that he has free time on other days, which complicates things.\n\nAnother angle is the financial aspect. They can't move to a bigger apartment because of the husband's unstable job and the high cost of housing in their city. This means the current living situation is a temporary constraint, but it's affecting their current quality of life. The author's request is about managing their shared space, not about long-term solutions they can't afford.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, communication is key. The author is expressing a need for alone time, which is a valid personal boundary. However, the husband's feelings of not being welcome indicate a possible miscommunication. It's not just about the time she wants alone, but how he perceives her requests. The fact that they've been together for two years and this is still an issue might suggest that they haven't found a middle ground yet.\n\nI should also consider cultural or social norms. In some contexts, asking a partner to leave for a few hours might be seen as reasonable, especially if the space is shared and both need personal time. On the other hand, the husband's reaction could stem from feeling undervalued or neglected. It's a balance between individual needs and relationship harmony.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether the author's request is justified. Since she's not asking for excessive time and the husband has other days to be alone, it seems reasonable. However, the husband's emotional response might be valid as well, indicating a deeper issue about feeling included in the home. The author isn't in the wrong for having needs, but perhaps there's room for both to communicate better and find compromises that address both parties' needs.\n"
