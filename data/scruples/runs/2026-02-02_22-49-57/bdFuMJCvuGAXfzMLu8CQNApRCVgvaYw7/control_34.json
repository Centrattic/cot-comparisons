I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for asking her husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. \n\nFirst, the situation is that they live in a studio apartment with no privacy. The wife values alone time, which is understandable. She works full-time, while her husband works part-time. He's often at home, and when she asks him to leave to have some time to herself, he gets hurt and feels unwelcome. The husband's job is unstable, and they can't afford to move to a bigger place right now.\n\nSo, the key points are: the wife's need for personal space, the husband's feelings of being unwelcome, and their financial situation. The wife is asking for a few hours on a Saturday, but the husband reacts negatively. She's not asking for a lot\u2014just a couple of hours to herself. The husband, however, feels that if he can't be home on Saturday, his weekend isn't relaxing, even though he's free on other days. \n\nI need to consider both sides. The wife has a valid need for personal space, especially in a studio apartment where privacy is limited. It's common for people to need some alone time. On the other hand, the husband might feel that his presence is constant and that his wife's request makes him feel like an outsider. But the husband does have a lot of free time, as the wife points out. The problem might be communication or differing needs.\n\nIs the wife in the wrong? She's asking for a reasonable request\u2014some time alone. The issue might be how the husband reacts, not the request itself. The husband's reaction seems extreme if he has plenty of time when she's at work. The wife isn't asking for a lot, just a few hours on a specific day. The husband's job situation is unstable, but that doesn't necessarily mean he can't find things to do. The fact that he's not meeting friends much could be a point where he might need to take initiative to find activities.\n\nSo, the wife isn't in the wrong for wanting her space. The problem might lie in the husband's reaction and maybe not enough effort from him to engage in activities when he's not working. The wife is trying to communicate her needs, which is important in a relationship. The husband could be feeling insecure or neglected, but the wife's request is reasonable. Therefore, the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
