I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the original post (OP) is in the wrong. The situation is that OP lives in a studio apartment with her husband. She wants some alone time, so she asks him to leave for a few hours on weekends. Her husband takes it badly, feeling unwelcome and not understanding why she needs the time. They can't move to a bigger place because of financial issues.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. OP values alone time, which is reasonable. Studio apartments are small, so privacy is limited. She works full-time, he works part-time. He's home a lot, not going out much. She wants time to herself, but he feels it's a rejection. They can't move because of money.\n\nIs it OP's fault? Well, wanting alone time isn't unreasonable. People need personal space. But how she communicates it matters. If she asks him to leave and he feels hurt, maybe there's a communication issue. However, the problem might be that he's not used to the apartment feeling like his home yet. He might be struggling with the adjustment. His reaction seems a bit over-the-top, especially since he has time alone on other days. She's not asking for much, just a few hours on Saturday. He's also home on Friday and Monday. Maybe he's not using that time to go out. \n\nThe husband's response of needing specific hours and what to do when friends aren't available seems like he's not taking responsibility for finding his own time. It's his job to manage his free time, not hers. OP isn't at fault for needing her space. She's not being selfish; she's trying to maintain her mental health and personal time. The husband's feelings are valid, but he needs to adjust. The answer should be B, she's not in the wrong. They need to work on communication and him taking initiative to find activities. The husband's reaction is the issue here, not her request.\n"
