I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for asking her husband to leave for a few hours. Let me break down the details.\n\nFirst, they live in a studio apartment, which is very small. The wife works full-time, while her husband works part-time (10-20 hours a week). He's mostly home when she is, and she needs alone time. She values solitude and used to live alone. When she asks him to leave, he gets hurt and feels unwelcome. The husband's job is unstable, and they can't move because of financial issues in a high-cost city.\n\nThe key points here are the need for personal space versus the husband's feelings of not being welcome. The wife isn't asking for a lot; just a couple of hours. The husband's reaction seems more about feeling rejected rather than the time itself. He's home a lot, so having some time alone shouldn't be unreasonable. However, his emotional response might indicate deeper issues, like insecurity or a need for validation.\n\nBut is she in the wrong? Well, she's the one who moved into the apartment, and he's been there almost two years. The fact that he doesn't feel it's his home yet could contribute to his sensitivity. However, having alone time is a reasonable request. The problem might be communication. She's explaining her need, but he's taking it personally. Maybe she could frame it differently, like suggesting activities for him instead of just asking him to leave, but the core request isn't unreasonable. The husband's reaction seems more about his feelings of not belonging rather than the action itself. So, I think the wife isn't in the wrong here. The answer should be B.\n"
