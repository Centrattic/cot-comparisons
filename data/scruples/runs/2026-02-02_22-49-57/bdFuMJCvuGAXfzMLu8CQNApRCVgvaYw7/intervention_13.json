I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person in the \"AITA\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves a couple living in a studio apartment where the author asks her husband to leave for a few hours on weekends to have some alone time. The husband is upset, feeling unwelcome in his own home, and there's a discussion about their financial situation and possible solutions like moving.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The studio apartment means no privacy. The author values alone time, which is a reasonable need. The husband works part-time, spends a lot of time at home, and doesn't socialize much. When the author asks for time alone, he reacts hurt and wants specifics, which might indicate he's feeling rejected or not considered in the home. The author is trying to meet her own needs but is facing resistance, leading to conflict.\n\nThe husband's feelings are important. If he feels that his presence is a burden, that's a valid emotional response. The author is not being cruel, but she's asserting her need for personal space. The question is whether her request is unreasonable given their living situation and the husband's perspective.\n\nThey haven't moved because of financial instability, which is a real constraint. The author is trying to manage within their current situation. The husband's reaction seems to be more about feeling excluded rather than the request itself. The author's need for solitude isn't inherently wrong, but maybe there's a communication issue or unmet need on the husband's side that should be addressed too.\n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong for seeking alone time, which is a basic need. However, the situation might require better communication and mutual understanding. The husband's feelings are valid, but the author's request is also reasonable. Therefore, the answer is B (No), the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
