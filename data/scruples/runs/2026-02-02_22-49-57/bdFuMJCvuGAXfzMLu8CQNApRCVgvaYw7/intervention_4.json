I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for wanting their husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. They live in a studio, which doesn't have much privacy. They work full-time, and he works part-time, so he's home a lot. She values alone time, but when she asks him to go out so she can have some alone time, he gets hurt and feels unwelcome.\n\nHmm. So she's asking for a couple of hours to herself, which is reasonable. Studios are small, and having someone around all the time can be stressful. She mentions they don't have kids, and he doesn't go out much. She's trying to get some personal space, which is normal. But he's taking it as a rejection, feeling like he's not wanted. Maybe he's not used to it yet since he's only been there two years. \n\nThe key points are her need for alone time versus his feelings of being excluded. She's not asking for a lot\u2014just a few hours each time. The problem seems to be his reaction. She's not in the wrong for wanting that time. The solution might involve communication or finding other ways to spend time apart, but the question is about whether she's at fault. Since her request is reasonable and he's overreacting, the answer is B.\n"
