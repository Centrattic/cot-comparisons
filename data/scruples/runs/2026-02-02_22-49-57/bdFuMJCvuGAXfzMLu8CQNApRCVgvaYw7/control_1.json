I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple in a studio apartment where the husband is home a lot, and the wife wants some alone time by asking him to leave for a few hours. The husband gets hurt and feels unwelcome.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The wife values her privacy and alone time, which is understandable, especially in a small space. She works full-time and wants some personal time. On the other hand, the husband works fewer hours and might be feeling isolated since he's home most of the time. He might feel that when she asks him to leave, it's a rejection or that he's not part of the home.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual understanding. The wife is asking for something reasonable, but the way the husband reacts might indicate deeper issues. If he's not meeting friends often and is home a lot, maybe he's lonely. But the wife's need for alone time is also valid. However, the husband's reaction of feeling unwelcome could be a problem. \n\nBut the question is whether the author (the wife) is in the wrong. From the description, she's not being mean; she's trying to balance her need for space with their current situation. The husband's response is more problematic because he's taking it personally and not considering her needs. The wife isn't asking for a lot of time, just a couple of hours on a Saturday. Given that they can't move due to financial reasons, she's trying to make the best of the situation. So, the wife isn't in the wrong. The husband's feelings are his responsibility, and maybe they need better communication strategies. The answer should be B (No).\n"
