I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple living in a studio apartment where the wife is asking her husband to leave for a few hours on a Saturday to have some alone time. The husband gets hurt and feels unwelcome, and there's some tension around the living situation and his job instability.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The wife values her alone time because they live in a small space. She works full-time, and he works part-time, so he's home more. She just wants a few hours to herself. On the other hand, the husband feels that when she asks him to leave, it makes him feel like he's not welcome in their home. He might also feel that he's not getting enough social time or that his needs aren't being considered. \n\nThe key points are communication and mutual understanding. The wife is asking for personal space, which is a valid need. People need alone time to recharge. However, the husband's reaction of feeling unwelcome and his need for social interaction are also important. The problem might be how the request is being communicated or the lack of compromise. \n\nThe wife isn't being unreasonable by wanting some time alone, especially given their living situation. The husband's job is unstable, so he might not have the resources to move to a bigger place yet, and his part-time schedule means he's home a lot. It's possible that he's feeling isolated and the requests for him to leave are adding to that. \n\nThe answer hinges on whether the wife's request is reasonable and if the husband is overreacting. Since the wife is just asking for a couple of hours and not excluding him from the home entirely, she's not in the wrong. The issue might be more about how the request is framed and the need for both to communicate their feelings better. The husband's reaction seems more about feeling unappreciated rather than the request itself. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. She has a valid need for alone time, and the problem lies more in the husband's feelings of being unwelcome and the couple's communication issues rather than her request itself.\n"
