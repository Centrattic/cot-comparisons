I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple living in a studio apartment where the wife wants some alone time, so she asks her husband to leave for a few hours. The husband feels hurt and doesn't feel welcome. The author is wondering if they're at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author (the wife) works full-time, and the husband works part-time, so he's home more. She values alone time, which is valid. Studio apartments are small, so no privacy. She's not asking him to leave every day, just a couple of hours on a Saturday. But when she does, he gets hurt and questions why she needs specific hours and what he should do. He also mentions his weekend plans and that he's home alone on other days. \n\nThe husband's reaction seems to stem from feeling unwelcome. Maybe he feels like his presence is burdensome, especially since he's not working much. He might be struggling with his identity or confidence, given his job instability. The financial aspect of moving to a bigger place isn't feasible right now. \n\nThe author's request is reasonable for her mental health and personal space. It's important for relationships to have mutual respect for each other's needs. However, communication is key here. The husband's reaction might be due to insecurity or not feeling included. The author isn't being selfish; she's asking for time to herself, which is a common need. The husband needs to work on his feelings of not being welcome and perhaps find other ways to have his own time, rather than taking it personally. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. She's advocating for her needs, which are valid. The issue might be more about the husband's emotional response and their communication. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
