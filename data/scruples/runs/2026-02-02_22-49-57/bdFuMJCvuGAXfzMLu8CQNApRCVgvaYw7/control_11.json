I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So, the situation is a couple living in a studio apartment. The wife wants some alone time, so she asks her husband to leave for a couple of hours. The husband feels hurt and doesn't see why he can't stay home, even though he's home a lot already. The question is whether the wife is at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The wife values her alone time, which is understandable. Studio apartments are small, so lack of privacy is a common issue. She works full-time, and he works part-time, so maybe their schedules mean he's home more. She's asking for a few hours to herself, which seems reasonable. The husband's reaction is that he feels unwelcome and that his time is being controlled. He might feel like his presence is always a burden or that he's not part of the home.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. The wife's need for alone time is valid, but the way she communicates it might be a problem. If she's making him leave, maybe without considering his feelings, that could be an issue. But from her perspective, she's just trying to get some space. The husband's reaction seems a bit over the top. He's home a lot, but he's not working full-time and doesn't have many social activities. However, feeling that his home is being taken away is a valid emotional response.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). I need to decide based on the information given. The wife's request for alone time is reasonable, but the husband's feelings are also valid. However, the main issue is whether the wife is wrong in asking him to leave. Since she's in a small space and needs time to herself, and the husband is home a lot anyway, it's hard to say she's wrong. The problem might be more about how the request is made or the husband's sensitivity rather than the request itself. So the answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
