I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. The situation involves living in a studio apartment with a spouse who works part-time and doesn't go out much, leading to a lack of alone time.\n\nFirst, the author works full-time, so they might need personal time after work. The husband works less, so he's home more. The author values alone time, which is understandable. The husband reacts hurt when asked to leave, feeling unwelcome. \n\nI need to consider if the author's request is unreasonable. They mention that the husband has been in the apartment for two years and it's still not his home. Maybe he's adjusting to living together. The author isn't asking to kick him out but for a few hours of privacy. \n\nThe husband's reaction seems to be about feeling excluded. Maybe he doesn't have a strong social circle, so being asked to leave might make him feel like he's not part of the home. But the author is asking for personal time, which is a valid need. \n\nThe author also mentions financial constraints preventing a bigger apartment. So moving isn't an option right now. They're trying to manage with what they have. \n\nIs the author overstepping? It depends on communication. The author is expressing a need, which is okay. The husband's feelings are important too, but the author isn't being selfish; they're seeking balance. \n\nThe key point is that both need to meet in the middle. The husband should find ways to occupy himself when asked, but the author isn't wrong in wanting alone time. The problem might be in how the request is communicated and the husband's sensitivity. \n\nSo the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong. They're seeking personal space in a shared living situation, which is normal. The husband's reaction is the issue here, not the request itself.\n"
