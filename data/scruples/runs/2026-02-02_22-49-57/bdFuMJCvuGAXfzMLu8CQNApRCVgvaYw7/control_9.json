I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the original question is in the wrong. The author is asking for their husband to leave the studio apartment for a few hours on a Saturday afternoon so they can have some alone time. They mention that the husband gets hurt and feels unwelcome when they ask for this. The husband works part-time and has a lot of free time, but he seems to take it personally when she wants time alone. The author also explains that moving to a bigger apartment isn't an option right now due to financial issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is in a small living space with their partner, which naturally limits personal space. They work full-time and need some time to themselves, which is a reasonable request. The husband, on the other hand, might feel that his presence is being rejected or that the home isn't his. He might be sensitive about having his time managed by the author, especially if he's not working much. His reaction could stem from feeling isolated or insecure about his role in the relationship.\n\nBut the key point is whether the author is in the wrong. The author is asking for a reasonable amount of time alone, which is a basic need for many people. The husband's response of feeling unwelcome and becoming hurt seems like a misunderstanding. The author isn't asking for anything unreasonable; they're just seeking personal time. The husband's job situation being unstable might contribute to his need for social interaction, but that doesn't justify not respecting the author's needs. The author isn't rejecting him; they're setting boundaries for their own well-being.\n\nHowever, communication is crucial here. The author might need to approach the request differently, perhaps by being more understanding of his feelings and finding compromises. But the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Since the request for personal time is reasonable and the husband's reaction is over-sensitive, the author isn't necessarily at fault. The problem might lie in how the request is communicated or the husband's inability to process it without feeling hurt.\n\nIn summary, the author's need for alone time is valid. The husband's emotional response is problematic, but that doesn't make the author wrong. The author isn't being unreasonable by asking for a few hours to themselves. The issue is more about mutual understanding and communication rather than the author being in the wrong.\n"
