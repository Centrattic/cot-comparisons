I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for asking her husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. They live in a studio apartment with no kids, so space is tight. The husband works part-time (10-20 hours a week) and doesn't go out much. The author wants some alone time, which she valued when living alone. The husband gets hurt and questions the exact number of hours and what he should do when his friends aren't available. Also, they can't move due to his unstable job and high housing costs.\n\nFirst, the author's need for alone time seems reasonable. People often need personal space, especially in a studio where privacy is limited. She's working full-time, so maybe her time is more structured, while her husband's part-time schedule gives him more free time at home. But the husband's reaction is problematic. He's taking her request as not feeling welcome, which might be a hurtful interpretation. He's also being defensive about the specific hours and activities, which could indicate he's not comfortable with the idea of her needing time alone. \n\nThe husband's job instability and financial issues are real challenges, but that doesn't negate the author's need for personal time. The fact that they can't move right now due to these reasons is a valid point, but the author isn't asking to move; she's asking for a few hours alone. The husband might need to find alternative ways to spend time when his friends aren't available, like hobbies or other activities. However, his emotional response and insistence on specifics might not be the healthiest approach. \n\nThe day trip to the sea is on Sunday, and he's worried about having no relaxing weekend if he can't be home on Saturday. But he's already home alone on Friday and Monday. Maybe he's not using that time effectively, or he's feeling that his limited free time is being taken away. Still, the author is asking for a small window of time, not the entire weekend. \n\nIt's a communication issue, perhaps. The author isn't in the wrong for needing her space, but maybe she could approach the request more gently. The husband's reaction seems to stem from insecurity or feeling unwanted, which isn't the author's intention. However, the core need for alone time is understandable. The answer likely leans towards the author not being in the wrong, but there's room for both sides to improve communication and understanding.\n"
