I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave for a few hours. They live in a studio apartment with no privacy, and the husband works fewer hours, so he's home a lot. The husband gets hurt when she asks him to go out, making it seem like he doesn't feel welcome. The author wants alone time, which is something she values, but the husband is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has a full-time job, and the husband works part-time. They don't have kids, so the husband is at home more. The studio apartment setup means there's no separate space for either person. The author is asking for a few hours alone, which is reasonable for someone who values privacy. But the husband reacts negatively, feeling it's not his home anymore.\n\nThe key points here are about boundaries and mutual respect. The author is not being unreasonable in asking for alone time. Everyone needs personal space, especially in a small living situation. However, the husband's reaction is problematic. He's not taking into account her need for privacy and instead focuses on his own feelings of exclusion. The fact that he has other days when he's alone (like Friday and Monday) suggests that the Saturday request isn't unreasonable. \n\nThe wife's request is reasonable, and the husband's emotional response is part of the issue here. The author isn't in the wrong because she's asserting her need for alone time, which is a basic human need. The husband needs to take responsibility for his reaction and find ways to manage his time without feeling neglected. The situation is more about his inability to adjust rather than her being in the wrong. So, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
