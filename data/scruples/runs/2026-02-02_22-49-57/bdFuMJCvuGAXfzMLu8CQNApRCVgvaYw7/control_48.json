I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple living in a studio apartment, and the wife is asking her husband to leave for a few hours on the weekend to have alone time. The husband is getting hurt and feels unwelcome. The question is whether she's at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The apartment is a studio, so no privacy. The husband works part-time and is home a lot. The wife values alone time, which makes sense. She's not asking for a long time, just a couple of hours on a Saturday. The husband reacts negatively, feeling unappreciated and not welcomed in his home. He also brings up Friday and Monday as times he's alone, but she thinks he's being illogical because he has other free days.\n\nNow, considering the wife's perspective, she's justified in wanting personal space. Living in a studio can be tough for two people, especially if one is home more. It's reasonable to want some solitude. The husband's reaction seems more about feeling slighted than the request itself. He might be interpreting her need for alone time as rejection or not valuing his presence. That's a common issue in relationships where one partner's needs are seen as a personal attack.\n\nOn the husband's side, he might feel that he's contributing in his own way and that his need for a relaxing weekend is important. However, the wife's request isn't about excluding him all the time but having a few hours. The problem seems to be communication. The husband's response of getting hurt and wanting specific hours might be overreacting. It's possible he's struggling with the fact that the apartment isn't his, but that's a different issue. The wife isn't asking him to leave permanently.\n\nThe fact that they can't move due to financial reasons adds another layer. They have to work with what they have until his job situation improves. So, the wife is trying to find a solution within their current living arrangement. The husband's lack of friends or social activities might mean he's not used to being out, but that doesn't negate her need for space. \n\nIs the wife in the wrong? Probably not. She's advocating for her own needs, which is valid. The husband's reaction is more about how he feels about the situation rather than the request itself. The issue is more about how they communicate and understand each other's needs rather than the request being inherently wrong. So, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
