I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that she lives in a studio apartment with her husband. She wants some alone time because the small space means there's no privacy. She asks him to leave for a couple of hours, but he gets hurt and feels unwelcome in his own home. The question is whether she's wrong for doing this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their living situation. A studio apartment is really small, so it's understandable that both people might need some time apart to have personal space. She values alone time, which is a common need for many people. She mentions that she works full-time and he works part-time, which might mean different schedules. She also says he doesn't go out much or meet friends often, so maybe he's home a lot. But she wants time to herself, which is normal.\n\nHowever, when she asks him to leave, he feels hurt and thinks it's not fair. He seems to feel that he's being asked to do something that's not necessary because he's already home a lot. She's trying to have time alone, which is reasonable, but his reaction is emotional. The key here is whether her request is reasonable and if his reaction is valid.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I agree. She's asking for her own mental space in a small living situation. The problem might be communication. Maybe she needs to explain her needs better, but the request itself isn't unreasonable. He should understand that everyone needs alone time. The fact that he feels unwelcome might be his own issue with sharing the space. Also, they can't move to a bigger apartment right now due to financial reasons, so the studio will have to do for now. She's not being selfish by wanting time to herself. So, answer B (No).\n"
