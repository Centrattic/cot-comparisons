I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see here. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple living in a studio apartment where the husband works part-time and the wife wants some alone time. The wife asks him to leave for a few hours so she can have privacy, but he feels hurt and perceives it as not being welcome in his home. The question is whether the wife is wrong for asking.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The studio apartment has no alone time when both are home. The wife values alone time, which she used to have when living alone. The husband works less and is often home, which the wife points out. She's not asking him to leave all the time\u2014just occasionally, like on a Saturday afternoon. However, he reacts emotionally, feeling unwelcome, and questions the exact hours and what he should do outside. The wife is trying to communicate her need for space, which is a common human need. \n\nThe husband's reaction seems to be about feeling excluded or not valued. But the wife's request is reasonable given the living situation. It's a common issue in close living quarters. The wife doesn't have the financial stability to move right now, so she's trying to manage within the current setup. The husband's job is unstable, which adds to the financial constraints. \n\nIs the wife wrong? She's asking for her own mental well-being and personal space, which is valid. The husband's feelings are important too, but his reaction might be over the top. The wife isn't saying he can't be there all the time, just that sometimes she needs time alone. The fact that he's home a lot and could go out on his own (even if he doesn't have friends readily available) might be a point. The wife isn't refusing to spend time with him; she just needs some solitude occasionally. \n\nSo, the answer is probably B\u2014she's not in the wrong. She's clearly communicating her needs, which are reasonable. The husband's reaction is more about how he feels about his role in the relationship and possibly insecurity, but that doesn't make the wife's request wrong. The key here is whether her request is unreasonable, and considering the studio apartment and her history of valuing alone time, it's not. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
