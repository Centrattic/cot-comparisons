I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple in a studio apartment where the wife asks her husband to leave for a few hours on a Saturday afternoon to have some alone time. The husband gets hurt and feels unwelcome, and they can't move to a bigger place yet because of his unstable job and high housing costs.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. Studio apartments are small, so having no alone time can be tough. The wife works full-time and values her privacy, which is understandable. She's not asking for long periods but just a couple of hours. The husband, who works less, might feel like he's always at home and doesn't get enough social interaction. His reaction of feeling unwelcome is a problem, but does that make the wife in the wrong for asking for time to herself?\n\nThe husband's work schedule is part of the issue. He might not have the same opportunities to be out as she does, so when she asks him to leave, it's a way for him to have social time too. However, the wife's need for solitude is valid. Maybe the conflict arises from communication. The husband's response seems to be emotional rather than addressing the request. But the wife's request isn't unreasonable. She's being specific about the time and not excluding him from other parts of her life. \n\nThe fact that they can't move to a bigger apartment due to financial instability adds another layer. The wife might not be able to afford to wait for a better situation, so she's trying to carve out personal time now. The husband's reaction might stem from feeling that his presence is a burden, but that doesn't negate her need for space. \n\nLooking at the AITA (Am I the Asshole) structure, the key is whether the request was fair. The wife is asking for a reasonable amount of time, not to exclude him entirely. The husband's hurt feelings are his own reaction, but the wife isn't wrong for wanting solitude in a small space. The answer likely hinges on the idea that needing personal time is normal, and the husband's response is more about his feelings. So the author is not in the wrong.\n"
