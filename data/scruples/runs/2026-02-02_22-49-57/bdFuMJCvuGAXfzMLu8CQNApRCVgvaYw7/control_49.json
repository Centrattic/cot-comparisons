I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple living in a studio apartment where the wife (the author) wants some alone time, so she asks her husband to leave for a few hours. The husband is hurt and feels unwelcome, which is causing tension.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author values her alone time and needs it to feel at home. Studio apartments are small, so having someone else around all the time can be stressful. She works full-time, and he works part-time. He's home more, and maybe he's not used to being in the apartment all the time. The husband's reaction seems to be about feeling unappreciated or not being part of the home. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points are: Is asking for alone time reasonable? Does the husband have a valid point about feeling unwelcome? The author isn't asking for the entire weekend; it's just a few hours. The husband's response seems a bit over the top. But maybe there's a communication issue here. The author wants space, and the husband might feel that his presence is being rejected. \n\nConsidering that they live in a big city with unstable job situations, moving isn't an option right now. So they have to work with the current setup. The author isn't being selfish here; she's asking for a couple of hours of alone time, which is a common need in relationships. The husband's reaction of feeling hurt might stem from deeper issues, like feeling disconnected or not included. But the author isn't wrong for wanting alone time. It's not about excluding him all the time, just occasionally. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. She's advocating for her need for personal space, which is reasonable. The husband's response might be a sign that they need to work on communication and understanding each other's needs better, but the author's request itself is valid.\n"
