I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for asking her husband to leave their studio apartment for a few hours. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. They live in a studio apartment, which gives them no privacy. The husband works part-time (10-20 hours a week), so he's home a lot. The author works full-time but still needs alone time. She's been asking him to leave on weekends, like Saturdays, so she can have a few hours to herself. However, when she does this, he gets hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his home. He also wants specific times and activities, which seems to add pressure.\n\nThe author values alone time and has always loved living alone. She mentions that the husband has been in her apartment for almost two years and it doesn't feel like his home yet. The husband's job is unstable, and they can't afford a bigger place right now. They live in a big city where housing is expensive.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is wrong. Let's consider both sides. From the author's perspective, she has a right to personal space. Even in a shared home, needing some alone time is normal. The studio apartment setup makes that hard, especially when the other person is home a lot. But the husband is hurt because he feels unwelcome. His reaction might stem from not feeling like he belongs in the home, which could be due to the apartment still being hers and him not contributing to the move due to financial reasons.\n\nIs the author being unreasonable? She's not asking for a lot\u2014just a few hours on a Saturday. But the husband's emotional response suggests deeper issues. Maybe he feels undervalued or that his presence is a burden. The author might not be wrong in wanting alone time, but perhaps the way she's communicated it is hurtful. However, she mentions that he gets hurt and wants specifics, which complicates things. It's also possible that the husband's lack of social activities (not meeting friends often) makes being alone at home less desirable for him. \n\nThe author's situation is complicated by financial constraints and the husband's job instability. They can't move to a bigger place yet. The author is trying to manage her need for space without those resources. The husband's reaction might be about feeling that his wife doesn't want him in their shared home, even though it's her apartment. It could be a matter of communication. Maybe the author hasn't explained how important alone time is to her, or the husband is feeling insecure about his role in the relationship. \n\nIn terms of fairness, needing personal space is valid. However, the husband's emotional response might indicate that his feelings of belonging and security are not being addressed. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting time to herself, but there might be a need for better communication and compromise. Since the husband is home most of the time and the apartment is small, the expectation might be that they spend some time apart. However, the husband's feelings of not being welcome are a valid concern. \n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but there's room for both to work on their communication. The key here is that the author has a right to her space, and the husband's emotional response is a separate issue that needs to be addressed. The answer is likely B (No), as the author isn't in the wrong, but the situation requires both parties to understand each other's needs.\n"
