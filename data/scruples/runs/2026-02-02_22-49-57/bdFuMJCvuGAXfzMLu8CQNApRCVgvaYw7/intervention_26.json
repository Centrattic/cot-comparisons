I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. The situation is they live in a studio apartment with no alone time. The husband works part-time and stays home a lot, and when the author asks him to go out so she can have time to herself, he gets hurt and feels unwelcome. The author values alone time, which they couldn't have in a shared space.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a legitimate need for personal space, especially given the living situation. It's common for people to require some alone time, even in relationships. The husband, on the other hand, might feel that his presence is a burden or that he's not accepted in the home. His reaction could stem from feeling rejected, especially if he doesn't have many social outlets. His job situation being unstable might contribute to his low self-esteem or need for validation.\n\nThe author isn't asking for a lot\u2014just a couple of hours on a Saturday afternoon. The husband's response seems more about feeling unappreciated rather than the time itself. The author's reasoning is about needing solitude, which is a valid emotional need. The husband's issue is more about how he's feeling when asked to leave, possibly due to insecurity or lack of confidence.\n\nThe user's own opinion is that the author isn't in the wrong, and I need to decide if that's correct. Factors to consider: the author's need for alone time is reasonable, the husband's reaction is emotional but doesn't negate the author's right to that time. The husband's lack of social activities might mean he's using the author's home as his primary space, so being asked to leave could feel like a loss of that space. However, it's possible the husband is overreacting or not communicating his feelings effectively. The author isn't being selfish; it's a temporary request. The husband's suggestion to move to a bigger apartment is a possible solution, but they can't afford it yet. \n\nIn relationships, balance is key. The author is trying to meet her needs, and the husband's needs are also important. But the question is about who's in the wrong. Since the author's action is reasonable and the husband's reaction is emotional, it's more likely that the author isn't in the wrong. The problem here is communication and possibly the husband's own insecurities rather than the author's request.\n"
