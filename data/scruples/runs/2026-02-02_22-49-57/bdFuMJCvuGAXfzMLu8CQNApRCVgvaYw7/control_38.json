I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about asking a husband to leave the apartment for a few hours because they live in a studio with no privacy. The user is the one who works full time and wants some alone time. The husband works part-time and doesn't go out much. He feels hurt when asked to leave and questions why he can't be home on other days.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author has a valid need for alone time, which is important for mental health. Living in a studio with someone can definitely make alone time challenging. The husband, on the other hand, feels like the home isn't his and gets hurt when asked to leave. He might be feeling insecure about his role in the relationship or his self-worth being tied to being present in the home.\n\nCommunication seems to be an issue here. The husband's reaction is emotional, which might stem from deeper insecurities rather than the request itself. He might not feel secure in the relationship or have other stressors contributing to his response. The author is asking for something reasonable\u2014some personal space\u2014but the way it's being communicated might not be the best. Maybe the husband feels it's a rejection or that he's not wanted.\n\nFinancial constraints are also a factor. They can't move to a bigger place right now because of his job situation. The author is trying to balance their needs within the current living situation. The husband's job instability adds pressure, which might affect his emotional state.\n\nThe key question is whether the author's request is reasonable. The author isn't asking to be alone all the time, just a couple of hours. The husband, however, is not using his free time to socialize, which could be a point. But it's also possible that he's not comfortable with friends or has other reasons for not going out.\n\nIn terms of being \"in the wrong,\" the author's need for alone time is legitimate. However, the way the request is made or the husband's interpretation of it could be where the problem lies. The husband's reaction seems disproportionate if the author is just seeking some personal time. But the author should also consider the husband's feelings and maybe find a more empathetic way to communicate the need, perhaps suggesting alternative activities for him instead of just asking him to leave.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Probably not. They have a reasonable request. The issue is more about how to communicate it effectively and address the husband's insecurities. The husband's reaction is more concerning because he's making the situation personal and not considering the author's legitimate need. Therefore, the answer is B (No).\n"
