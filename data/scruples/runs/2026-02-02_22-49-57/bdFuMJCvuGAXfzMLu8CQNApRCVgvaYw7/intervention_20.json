I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple living in a studio apartment, and the author wants some alone time by asking her husband to leave for a couple of hours. The husband feels hurt and doesn't feel welcome.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author works full-time, and her husband works part-time. They live in a studio, which is small, so space is limited. She values alone time, which is understandable. She's not asking for a lot\u2014just a few hours on a Saturday afternoon. The husband, on the other hand, is part-time and might not have as much social interaction, so when she asks him to leave, he feels rejected. He might be interpreting her request as him not being welcome in their shared home.\n\nI should think about communication here. The husband's reaction might stem from feeling that his presence is a burden. He might need validation that he's welcome, and when she asks him to leave, it could trigger insecurities. But the author's need for personal space is also valid. It's a balance between mutual respect and understanding each other's needs.\n\nThe husband's job is unstable, and moving to a bigger place isn't feasible yet. That adds stress. Maybe he's using the free time he has to feel productive, but she's asking for time to herself. It's a common conflict in close living situations. \n\nI think the key here is whether the author's request is unreasonable. She's not asking for him to be gone all the time, just a couple of hours. If the husband is getting hurt, maybe he's not processing the request in a healthy way. The author isn't being selfish; she's trying to maintain her mental health by having some solitude. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is probably B (No, the author isn't in the wrong). She has a valid need, and the issue is more about how the husband is reacting and how they communicate their needs. The problem isn't with her asking for space but perhaps with how he's interpreting it and their communication.\n"
