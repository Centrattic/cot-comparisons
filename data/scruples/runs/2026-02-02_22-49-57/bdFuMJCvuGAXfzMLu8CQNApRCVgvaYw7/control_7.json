I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is in the wrong for asking her husband to leave the apartment for a couple of hours. They live in a studio apartment, which is small, so space is limited. She wants some alone time because she values being alone, and she works full time. Her husband works part-time and is home a lot. When she asks him to leave, he gets hurt and feels unwelcome.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is requesting personal space, which is a reasonable need. Many people need time to themselves. The husband, on the other hand, might feel that his presence is being rejected, especially since he's less busy and spends more time at home. The key points here are communication and mutual understanding. \n\nThe author isn't asking him to leave all the time, just for a few hours. She also mentions that he has time alone on other days. The husband's reaction seems to be about feeling unwelcome, maybe because he's not used to the arrangement yet. They've been together for two years, so maybe it's time to address this. \n\nThe situation with the job and moving to a bigger apartment is a factor, but that's their long-term plan. The immediate issue is about respecting each other's needs. The author isn't being selfish; she's seeking a balance. The husband might need to find other ways to spend time alone or engage in activities without her. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong. It's reasonable to ask for personal space, especially in a situation where that space is limited. The main issue is how they communicate their needs. The husband's reaction is valid emotionally, but it's important for both to understand each other's perspectives. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
