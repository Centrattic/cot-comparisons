I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand it.\n\nThe author is a person living in a studio apartment with their husband. Since it's a studio, they don't have much alone time when both are home. The author values alone time and sometimes asks the husband to leave for a couple hours to have some privacy. The husband works part-time (10-20 hours a week), so he's home a lot. The author works full-time. The husband doesn't go out much or meet friends often. When the author asks him to go out so she can have time alone, he gets hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome. He wants specific details about how many hours she needs and what he should do. They're planning a day trip, but he's upset if he can't stay home on Saturday. The author mentions that he's home alone on other days (like Friday and possibly Monday) and doesn't see why he's so upset. They can't move to a bigger apartment yet because of financial instability.\n\nSo the question is whether the author is in the wrong for asking the husband to leave. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author's perspective: They need alone time. It's a studio apartment, so personal space is limited. They work full-time and have the right to some personal time. The husband's job allows him to be home a lot, and the author is trying to balance their need for privacy without the husband being present. The husband, on the other hand, feels hurt and unwelcome when asked to leave. He seems to take it personally, maybe feeling that the home isn't his, and is frustrated when the author doesn't provide a specific schedule. The husband's reaction is emotional, suggesting he may not feel part of the home or that his presence is a burden.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The author is asking for reasonable time alone, which is a common need. However, the husband's emotional response and feeling unwelcome might indicate a deeper issue. The author's request is about personal space, but the husband's reaction might be about feeling excluded or not part of the home. The key here is whether the author's request is reasonable and if the husband's response is disproportionate.\n\nThe author is not asking the husband to leave every day, just occasionally for a few hours. The husband's part-time schedule gives him a lot of free time, and the author is trying to use that to have some solitude. The husband's issue seems to be about how it's presented, maybe not feeling comfortable in the home, or feeling that the author doesn't want him around. The author might need to communicate better, but the request itself is valid. The husband's response is more about his feelings rather than the request itself. \n\nFinancial issues prevent moving to a bigger apartment, so they have to work with the space they have. The author is trying to find a solution within their current situation. The husband's reaction could be due to feeling that the author doesn't value his presence, or that he's being asked to make sacrifices. However, the author is also trying to maintain their mental health by having some alone time, which is important in a relationship.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? I don't think so. They have a legitimate need for personal time. The husband's reaction is more about his feelings and possibly not understanding the author's need. The problem might be communication or the husband's emotional response rather than the request itself. Therefore, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong).\n"
