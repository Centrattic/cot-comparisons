I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out whether the author is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave for a few hours. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author lives in a studio apartment with their husband. Studio apartments are small, so there's no separate rooms except maybe a kitchen and a bathroom. The husband works only 10-20 hours a week, so he's home a lot. The author works full-time and wants some alone time, so they ask him to leave for a couple of hours on weekends. The husband gets hurt and feels unwelcome, thinking it's his home too. The author explains that the husband isn't out with friends much and has plenty of free time. They also mention that moving to a bigger place isn't feasible right now due to financial issues from the husband's unstable job and high housing costs in the city.\n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong and wants to know if I agree. Let me break this down. The key points are the studio apartment's layout, the husband's limited social life, the author's need for alone time, and the husband's reaction. The author is asking for a few hours of privacy, which is a reasonable request. The problem seems to be the husband's emotional response and not taking into account the author's need for space. \n\nBut maybe there's a misunderstanding here. The husband might feel that since he's living there, it's his home too. The author is the one who owns the apartment, but they're sharing it. However, the husband moving in two years ago suggests it's a shared living space now. The author's request isn't to leave every time but occasionally for a few hours. The husband's reaction of feeling hurt and questioning how long and what he should do suggests he's struggling with the idea of not being included. \n\nThe author's justification is that the husband has plenty of free time and the space isn't being used for anything else. The husband's job situation is unstable, but that's a separate issue. The author's need for alone time is valid, especially living in a tight space. The husband's response seems to be taking it personally, which might be a communication problem. \n\nI think the author is justified in wanting alone time. It's a reasonable request, especially in a small space. The husband's reaction is more about his feelings of not being included or feeling that the author doesn't want him there. The author isn't being selfish; they're asking for a few hours, not all the time. The husband's problem might stem from deeper issues of feeling undervalued or not having enough social connections. The author isn't in the wrong here because it's about mutual respect and understanding each other's needs. The husband needs to communicate his feelings better instead of reacting hurtfully. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
