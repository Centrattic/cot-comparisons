I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. The situation is that they live in a studio apartment, which is a small space. The husband works part-time and isn't out much, so he's home a lot. The author wants some alone time but when she asks him to leave, he gets hurt and feels unwelcome.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author has a right to personal space, especially since she works full-time and they don't have kids. Studio apartments are small, so alone time can be challenging. She's not asking for a lot\u2014just a couple of hours on a Saturday. But the husband is reacting emotionally, feeling like the home isn't his. That's a red flag. Maybe he feels insecure about his role or his contribution to the relationship.\n\nThe husband's job is unstable, and they can't move to a bigger place yet. That adds stress. But the author is trying to balance her need for space with his feelings. She's not being unreasonable by asking for time to herself. It's common for couples to need personal time, especially in a small living space. The husband's reaction seems more about feeling neglected or unappreciated rather than the request itself being wrong.\n\nI should also think about communication. The author is trying to communicate her needs, but the husband is interpreting it as rejection. They might need to work on how they express their needs to each other. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting alone time, but maybe she could approach it differently, like setting expectations earlier or finding compromises. However, the core issue is the husband's reaction, not the author's request. So the answer is B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
