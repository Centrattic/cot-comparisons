I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The question is whether the person who asked their husband to leave for a few hours is in the wrong. The situation is a studio apartment with no alone time, and the husband works part-time, so he's often home. The author wants some alone time, but the husband is hurt and feels unwelcome.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a valid need for personal space, especially since they work full-time and living in a studio can make that tough. It's reasonable to want some time alone, even a few hours. The husband's reaction seems hurtful, but why? He's home a lot and maybe feels like he's not part of the home or that his presence is resented. \n\nBut the author isn't asking him to leave every day or for long periods. Just a couple of hours on a Saturday. The husband's response of wanting specifics seems controlling. Also, the author mentions that he's home alone on other days, like Friday and possibly Monday, so there's time for him. The problem seems to be communication. The author's request is reasonable, but the husband's feelings are getting hurt, maybe because he hasn't adjusted to the living situation yet. \n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. From what's described, the author isn't being unreasonable. They explain their need for alone time, which is a common issue in small spaces. The husband's reaction is more about his feelings of not belonging, but that's on him to address. The author isn't at fault for wanting some personal time. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
