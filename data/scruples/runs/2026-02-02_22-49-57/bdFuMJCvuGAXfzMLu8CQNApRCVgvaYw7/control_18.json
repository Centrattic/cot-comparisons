I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again and break it down.\n\nThe author is asking their husband to leave the studio apartment for a couple of hours to have some alone time. They mention that the apartment is small, so there's no privacy. They work full-time, and the husband works part-time (10-20 hours a week), so he's home a lot. The husband gets hurt when asked to leave because he feels it's his home too. The author values alone time but the husband feels unwelcome. They can't move to a bigger place right now because of financial issues.\n\nHmm, the main issue here is about personal space and communication. The author is seeking time alone, which is understandable, especially in a studio apartment. But the husband's reaction is about feeling that his presence is being rejected. The author wants to go on a day trip on Sunday, and the husband is upset if he can't be home on Saturday too, even though he's home alone on Friday and Monday. \n\nI think the key points are whether the author's request is reasonable and if the husband's response is exaggerated. The author isn't asking for the entire weekend, just a couple of hours on Saturday. The husband's job situation is unstable, so maybe he's not used to having structured time or social activities. The author is trying to balance their need for solitude with the husband's feelings. \n\nIt seems like the author isn't in the wrong because having alone time is a valid need. The problem might be in how the request is communicated or the husband's interpretation. The husband's reaction of feeling unwelcome and being specific about the hours might be overreacting. The author is clear about their needs, and the husband's response could be about insecurity or not feeling included. \n\nSo the answer should be B (No), the author is not in the wrong. They're managing their need for space while considering their husband's situation, even though there's a communication issue on both sides.\n"
