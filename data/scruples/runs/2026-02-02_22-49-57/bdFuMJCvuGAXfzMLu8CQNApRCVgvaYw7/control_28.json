I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong for asking her husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. They live in a studio apartment with no alone time, and she works full-time while he works part-time. She wants some alone time because she values being alone. The husband gets hurt and feels unwelcome when she asks him to leave. They can't move because of financial issues.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider both sides. The author has a right to personal space, especially in a small living situation. She's working full-time and needs time to herself. On the other hand, the husband feels his needs aren't being considered. He works less hours and might feel like he's always home. But does that mean she's in the wrong for asking for time alone?\n\nThe key points: She's asking for a couple of hours, not the whole day. He has days when he's home alone, like Friday and Monday. He's supposed to meet friends but they don't have time. Maybe he's not making enough effort to find activities. She's trying to communicate her needs, which is reasonable. The husband's reaction seems a bit extreme, especially since he has other days off. The fact that they can't move yet because of financial instability adds pressure, but that doesn't mean she shouldn't have her needs met.\n\nThe husband's response of feeling unwelcome is a valid emotion, but maybe he's not processing it correctly. The author isn't rejecting him entirely; she's just asking for brief time alone. If he can't find other ways to spend his time, that's on him. The author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries for her mental health.\n"
