I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The author is a spouse who lives in a studio apartment with her husband. She's asking him to leave for a few hours so she can have some alone time. They both work, but she's full-time and he's part-time. The husband feels hurt and not welcome, interpreting her requests as him not being wanted in his own home.\n\nFirst, the studio apartment setup is cramped, which naturally limits personal space. The author values her alone time, which is a valid need. People need personal space even in relationships. But the husband's reaction is about feeling unwelcome. He might feel that the request is a rejection of his presence, especially since he's home more often and doesn't have a lot of social engagements.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual understanding. The author explains her need for solitude, which is reasonable. However, the husband's emotional response indicates he might feel insecure or unappreciated. It's not just about the hours she wants alone, but how the request is perceived by him. The author might not be in the wrong for wanting space, but maybe the way it's communicated or the frequency could be an issue. However, the situation doesn't specify any malicious intent from her side. The husband's issue seems more about feeling excluded rather than the request itself. Since the author is just seeking a couple of hours alone in a cramped space, and given that the husband has ample time alone during the week, her request isn't unreasonable. The problem lies in how it's affecting the husband's feelings. But the author's need for personal time is valid too. So, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
