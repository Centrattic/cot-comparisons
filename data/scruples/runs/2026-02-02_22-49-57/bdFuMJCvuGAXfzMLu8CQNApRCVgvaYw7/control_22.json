I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. They live in a studio apartment, which is small, so no alone time. The husband works part-time and doesn't go out much. The author values alone time and wants some hours to themselves. The husband gets hurt and feels unwelcome, and there's tension about moving to a bigger place because of financial issues.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are about personal space and communication. The author is seeking time alone, which is reasonable. But the husband is feeling rejected when asked to leave. The problem might be in how the request is made or how both are handling the situation. The husband's reaction suggests he might feel that his presence is a burden, or maybe he doesn't have enough social outlets. The author might not be wrong for needing space, but maybe they could communicate better or find a compromise. On the other hand, the husband's feelings are valid too. The situation is tricky because they can't move to a bigger place yet. \n\nI think the author isn't wrong because having time alone is important for mental health. But the husband's feelings are also valid. The issue here is mutual understanding. If the author is respectful and explains their needs without making the husband feel unwanted, it's a normal request. But if the husband is feeling isolated, maybe he needs to address his own social life. However, the author's need for personal space isn't unjustified. So, I lean towards the author not being in the wrong. They need to work on communication and finding solutions together, but the request itself isn't wrong. So answer B.\n"
