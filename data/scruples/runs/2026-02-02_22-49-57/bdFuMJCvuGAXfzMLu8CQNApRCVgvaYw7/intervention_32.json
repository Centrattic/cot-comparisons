I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a few hours.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. They live in a studio apartment, which is a small space with no separate rooms. The author works full-time, and the husband works part-time, so he's home more often. The author values alone time but isn't asking to be completely separate all the time. They just want a few hours to themselves, maybe on a Saturday afternoon. However, when the author asks, the husband gets hurt and feels unwelcome, even though he has plenty of free time otherwise.\n\nThe author also mentions that the husband's job is unstable, and they can't move to a bigger place right now. They're planning a day trip, and the husband is upset about not having a relaxing weekend if he's away on Saturday. The author is confused because the husband has free time on other days.\n\nHmm, so the key points are about personal space, communication, and differing needs. The author isn't asking for a lot\u2014just a few hours. It seems reasonable, especially since they don't have kids and the husband is home often. But the husband's reaction is emotional, feeling excluded. \n\nI should consider both perspectives. The author has a valid need for personal time, which is important for mental health. On the other hand, the husband might feel neglected or not included in the household. However, the author isn't refusing him entry to the home; they just want some alone time. The husband's response seems a bit over the top, given that he has other days to himself. \n\nThe author's request isn't unreasonable. They're not asking for constant separation but occasional space. The husband's job situation is unstable, but that doesn't justify his emotional reaction to a reasonable request. The author is trying to balance their needs with the husband's, but the husband isn't meeting them halfway. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're advocating for their own well-being. The issue might be more about the husband's communication style and possibly his own needs not being addressed. The answer should be B for No.\n"
