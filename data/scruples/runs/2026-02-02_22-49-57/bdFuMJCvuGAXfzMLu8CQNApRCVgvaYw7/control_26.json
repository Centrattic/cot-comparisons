I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about the author asking her husband to leave their studio apartment for a few hours to have some alone time. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. They live in a studio apartment, which is a small living space with no separate rooms. Both are home a lot\u2014the author works full-time, but her husband works only 10-20 hours a week. He doesn't go out much or meet friends often. The author values her alone time and wants to have a few hours without him. She's done this before, but he gets hurt and feels unwelcome. She's also planning a day trip on Sunday and he's upset if he can't stay home on Saturday.\n\nThe husband's job is unstable, and they can't move to a bigger place yet. The author is asking if she's wrong for wanting some time alone.\n\nSo, the key points are the author's need for personal space versus the husband's feelings of being unwelcome. The question is whether her request is unreasonable. \n\nIn relationships, having some alone time is normal and healthy. It's important for self-care and maintaining individual identity. Studio apartments can be challenging because there's no physical space to separate. The husband's reaction seems to be more about his feelings of not being included or valued in the home. However, the author is not asking him to leave all the time, just occasionally. \n\nThe husband's job situation and lack of social activities might contribute to his feeling of needing to be at home. But the author has valid needs too. It's a balance. The fact that she's already given him time on Friday and Monday might not matter to him, but it's a valid point for her. \n\nThe husband's response of getting hurt and wanting specific hours might be overreacting. The author isn't asking for a lot\u2014just a couple of hours. It's reasonable for her to want that, especially in a small space. \n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. She's advocating for her needs, which is important in a relationship. The husband needs to work on his feelings of unworthiness or insecurity, perhaps due to his job situation and lack of social life. But the request itself isn't unreasonable. So, the answer should be B (No).\n"
