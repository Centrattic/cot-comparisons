I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for asking her husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. They live in a studio apartment, so space is limited. The wife wants some alone time, which is understandable. She works full-time, and he works part-time, so he's home more. She's trying to get a couple of hours by herself, but when she asks, he gets hurt and feels unwelcome. He also questions the exact amount of time and what he should do outside. The wife thinks he's being overly sensitive and points out that he has plenty of free time otherwise.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The wife is not trying to exclude him all the time; just a few hours. She's valuing her own need for alone time, which is a common issue in close living situations. The husband's reaction seems to be more about feeling unappreciated or maybe not having his own space. But the wife has a valid point about the limited time she can have to herself. \n\nI should think about whether her request is reasonable. In a studio, there's no separate room, so even being in the kitchen is in the same area. The husband might not realize how much alone time is affected. The wife is asking for a specific window (Saturday afternoon), and he's countering by saying if he can't do that, his whole weekend is ruined, even though he has other days. \n\nAlso, the financial situation is a factor. They can't move to a bigger place yet because of his job stability. So the wife can't just fix the problem by moving. Her asking for a few hours might be a necessary compromise. \n\nThe husband's reaction seems a bit over the top. Feeling that the home isn't his yet might contribute to his hurt feelings. But the wife's need for personal space is also valid. It's a balance between mutual respect for each other's needs. \n\nSo, is she in the wrong? Probably not. She's communicating her needs, which is important in a relationship. The husband's issue is more about his own feelings of being unwelcome and not having enough social time, which might be his own personal issues. The wife isn't being unreasonable in asking for a few hours. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
