I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple living in a studio apartment with the husband working part-time. The wife wants some alone time, so she's asking him to leave for a few hours. He gets hurt and feels unwelcome, even though he has a lot of free time.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The wife values her personal space, which is understandable, especially in a small living space. She's working full-time, so maybe she needs some time to recharge. On the other hand, the husband feels that being asked to leave is him being excluded from his own home, which could affect his feelings of belonging in the relationship.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual understanding. The wife's need for alone time isn't unreasonable, but the husband's reaction suggests he might feel neglected or not valued. The problem arises when the wife's request leads to the husband feeling hurt. It's possible that their communication isn't aligned. If the wife can express her needs without making him feel excluded, maybe they could find a compromise. For example, maybe she could suggest activities he can do while she's having her alone time, or they could schedule specific times when they both know they can have alone time without feeling rejected.\n\nAlso, the husband's job situation and the financial constraints are important. They can't move to a bigger place right now, so they need to work with their current situation. The wife might need to be more empathetic towards the husband's feelings, especially if he's already feeling like the apartment isn't his. Maybe the husband's issue isn't just about the time but about feeling like he's not part of the home.\n\nBut at the same time, the wife's request for alone time is valid. Everyone needs personal space. The husband's reaction of getting hurt and wanting specific hours might be an overreaction. He could be taking it personally instead of seeing it as a need for personal space. However, the way the wife is asking might come off as dismissive of his presence in their home.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The wife isn't in the wrong for needing alone time, but perhaps she could approach the situation differently. The husband's reaction might stem from deeper insecurities or lack of communication. The answer might hinge on whether the wife's action is framed as a boundary that's reasonable versus the husband's emotional response. Since the question is whether the author (the wife) is in the wrong, if her request is reasonable and he's overreacting, she's not wrong. But if her way of asking is making him feel unwelcome, then maybe she's not communicating it well. However, the core issue is about personal space needs, which is a common challenge in close living situations. So the answer would likely be B (not in the wrong), but with the understanding that both partners need to work on communication.\n"
