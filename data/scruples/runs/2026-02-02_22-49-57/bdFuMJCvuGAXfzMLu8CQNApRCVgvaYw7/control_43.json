I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author (who is a woman in a relationship) is in the wrong for asking her husband to leave their studio apartment for a few hours. Let's break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the apartment is a studio, so there's no separate rooms. Both work, but she's full-time and he's part-time. He's often home, and she wants alone time, which he doesn't seem to get. When she asks him to leave, he gets hurt and questions the specifics. They can't move to a bigger place because of financial issues. \n\nSo, the key points here are about personal space needs and communication. The author feels the need for alone time, which is a common human need. However, her husband is taking it as a rejection or not feeling welcomed. He might feel that his presence is a burden or that the apartment isn't his home yet. \n\nBut the author's request is reasonable. She's not asking for a long time or every day. She just wants a few hours on a Saturday. The husband's reaction seems to stem from insecurity or feeling undervalued. The fact that he has time alone on other days (Friday and Monday) suggests he does have some alone time, but maybe not in the way he expects. \n\nThe problem might be more about communication. The author might not have explained her need clearly, or the husband might not be processing her request as a need for personal time rather than him being unwelcome. However, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting that time. It's important to balance both partners' needs. \n\nFinancial constraints are also a factor, making it hard to move. So the author isn't being selfish; she's trying to cope within their current situation. The husband's reaction seems a bit over the top, not considering that the author's request is legitimate. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong. She's advocating for her need for alone time, which is valid. The issue lies more in how the husband interprets her request and their communication. So the answer is B.\n"
