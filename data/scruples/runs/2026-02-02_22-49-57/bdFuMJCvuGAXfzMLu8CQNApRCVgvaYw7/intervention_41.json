I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThey live in a studio apartment, which means no separate rooms. The husband works part-time, so he's home a lot. The author wants some alone time because they value privacy. When she asks him to go out, he gets hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome. They can't move to a bigger place due to financial issues.\n\nHmm, the author is asking for personal space, which is a common need. But the husband is taking it personally, feeling like he's not welcome. The author's request is reasonable because even in a shared home, people need alone time. The husband having more free time might make him feel left out, but that's his issue to address. The author isn't being selfish; she's just asking for a few hours to herself. The husband's reaction seems more about his insecurities or not feeling part of the home. The author isn't wrong for needing space. So answer B.\n"
