I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple living in a studio apartment where the wife wants some alone time by having her husband leave for a couple of hours. The husband feels hurt and doesn't see the need since he's home a lot already.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The main issue is the request for alone time. The wife values her privacy and needs space, which is understandable. She works full-time, while he works part-time. They don't have kids. The problem arises when she asks him to leave so she can have time to herself, and he reacts negatively, feeling unwelcome. \n\nNow, considering the dynamics: the husband moving into her apartment two years ago but it not feeling like his home yet. That might contribute to his feelings of not being part of the space. His job instability and financial issues also play a role in not being able to move to a bigger place. He might feel that his presence is being rejected when she asks him to leave, even if it's just for a few hours. \n\nThe wife's perspective is that she's entitled to alone time, especially given the circumstances of living in a small space. The husband's reaction could stem from insecurity or not feeling integrated into the home. The fact that he has plenty of free time but still feels the need to be with her might indicate underlying issues about their relationship's balance.\n\nIs the wife in the wrong? Well, asking for personal time isn't inherently wrong. However, the way she communicates her needs might not be considering his feelings. She might not realize how her request affects him emotionally. On the other hand, the husband's response seems excessive if he's not using his free time to socialize or engage in activities. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, and I can see that reasoning. People do need personal space, especially in a studio apartment. But there's a communication gap here. The husband's hurt feelings suggest that there's more to his reaction than just the request itself. Maybe he feels neglected or that his presence isn't appreciated. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the request is reasonable. Since the wife is asking for a few hours of alone time in a situation where they share a small space, it's reasonable. However, the husband's emotional response indicates a deeper issue that might need addressing, like feeling excluded from his own home. But the act of asking for alone time isn't the problem here. The problem is how both parties are communicating their needs and feelings. \n\nTherefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The issue is more about mutual understanding and communication rather than the request itself being wrong. The husband needs to address his feelings of not being part of the home, but the wife is justified in her need for personal space.\n"
