I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong for asking her husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThey live in a studio apartment, which means they don't have separate rooms. The husband works part-time, so he's home a lot. The author wants some alone time because she values being alone and used to living alone. She asks him to leave occasionally, but he gets hurt and feels unwelcome. She points out that he has free time on other days, like Friday and Monday, and that they can't move because of financial issues related to his job.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about personal space and communication. The author is asking for her own time, which is reasonable. The husband's reaction seems to be that he feels rejected or not accepted in the home. But the author is clear that she's not denying him a place to stay; he's home a lot and has other days free. The problem might be that the husband is taking the request for alone time as a rejection rather than understanding it's a need for personal space. \n\nThe author isn't being mean or unreasonable. She's explaining her need for solitude, which is a valid human need. The husband's emotional response might stem from insecurity or feeling that his presence is burdensome. The fact that they can't move right now because of financial constraints adds another layer, but the author isn't asking for a move; she just wants some time apart.\n\nI think the author is in the right here. She's not wrong for needing space, and the issue is more about the husband's reaction and communication between them. So the answer should be B.\n"
