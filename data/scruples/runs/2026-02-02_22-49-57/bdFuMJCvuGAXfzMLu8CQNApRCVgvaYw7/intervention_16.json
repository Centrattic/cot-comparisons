I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. \n\nFirst, the couple lives in a studio apartment with no real alone time. The author works full-time, while her husband works only 10-20 hours a week. He doesn't go out much or see friends often. The author wants some alone time, which she used to have when living alone. She asks him to leave for a few hours on a Saturday, but he gets hurt and feels unwelcome. The husband is upset because he's home most of the time and doesn't have much social activity. The author also mentions that he's home alone on Friday and Monday, but he's still not okay with leaving on Saturday.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here, the author's request for personal space seems reasonable. Everyone needs some time alone, especially in a small living space. However, the husband's reaction is a key point. He's taking her request as a rejection, which might indicate deeper issues in their communication or emotional needs. The problem isn't just about the request itself but how both parties are handling it. \n\nThe author isn't wrong for needing and asking for alone time. The husband's hurt feelings might stem from feeling neglected or not included, but that doesn't make the author wrong. The situation suggests a communication breakdown rather than one person being entirely at fault. The husband's job instability and financial constraints add stress, which might affect his perspective. \n\nSo, while the author's request is valid, the husband's reaction is problematic. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting her space, especially given the circumstances. The main issue is how they handle each other's needs and emotions. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
