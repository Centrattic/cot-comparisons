I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking her husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. They live in a studio apartment with no alone time. She works full time, he works part-time. She values alone time, which he doesn't seem to understand. He feels hurt and says it's not his home.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective: she needs personal space, which is important for mental health. Living in a studio, it's hard to have privacy. She's not asking for a lot, just a couple of hours. On the other hand, her husband feels rejected when she asks him to leave. He might feel that his home isn't welcoming, especially if he's not used to sharing living space. He works less, so maybe he's more sensitive about his time at home.\n\nThe husband's reaction seems a bit over the top. If he has free time, like on Friday and Monday, maybe he could use that to do something. But the problem is that when she asks, he needs friends to be available, which might not be reliable. Also, he's comparing the weekend to other days, but maybe he's not using the other days to his advantage.\n\nThe user might be in the right because she's asserting her need for personal space, which is normal. However, the communication between them seems strained. The husband's feelings are valid too; he might feel that his partner doesn't want him there. It's a balance between personal needs and respecting each other's feelings. The answer likely leans towards B, not in the wrong, because she's reasonable and the husband's reaction is problematic. They need to communicate better and maybe find compromises, like specific times for alone space without making him feel unwelcome.\n"
