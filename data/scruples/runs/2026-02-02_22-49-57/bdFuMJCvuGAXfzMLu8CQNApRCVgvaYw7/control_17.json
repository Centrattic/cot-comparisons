I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author (the person asking the question) is in the wrong for asking her husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. They live in a studio apartment, which is a small space with no separate rooms. Both are home a lot\u2014she works full-time, and he works part-time. She values alone time, which is hard to get when he's around. So she asks him to leave for a few hours on weekends to have some privacy. But when she does this, he gets hurt and feels unwelcome. He also points out that he has free time on other days, like Friday and Monday, so why can't he just use those times?\n\nThe key points here are about personal space and communication. She's not asking him to leave every time, just occasionally. He's working less hours, so maybe he's home a lot more. But his reaction is emotional, feeling like the apartment isn't his home. That's a valid feeling for him, but she's also justified in needing some me-time. \n\nShe explains that moving to a bigger place isn't feasible because of financial issues and job instability. So the immediate solution isn't possible. The question is whether her asking for alone time is unreasonable.\n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong. Everyone needs some alone time, especially in a small living space. However, the way she communicates this might affect how he perceives it. Maybe she needs to approach it more sensitively, but the request itself isn't wrong. His reaction is about feeling rejected, but her need for space is valid. So the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
