I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by understanding the situation. The author is a woman who lives in a studio apartment with her husband. They don't have kids, and she works full time while he works part-time. The main issue is that she wants some alone time because the studio apartment doesn't offer much privacy. She asks her husband to leave for a few hours on weekends, like a Saturday afternoon, to have some space. But when she does this, he gets hurt and feels unwelcome in his own home. He also questions the exact number of hours she needs and what he should do when his friends aren't available. \n\nNow, the husband's job is unstable, and they can't afford a bigger place yet. They're hoping to move once his situation improves. The author is frustrated because she values alone time and has always loved living alone, but the husband seems to take her requests personally. \n\nFirst, I should consider both sides. The author has a legitimate need for personal space, which is important for mental health and well-being. Living in a studio with someone else, especially part-time, can be challenging for privacy. She's not asking for a lot\u2014just a few hours on a weekend. On the other hand, the husband might feel that being asked to leave is a rejection of his presence or that he's not part of the household. His hurt feelings could stem from feeling that his home isn't accepting of him, especially if he's home most of the time and not as social. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual understanding. The author is trying to meet her needs, but her husband feels hurt. It's possible that their communication isn't effective. The author might not be framing her request in a way that makes her husband feel valued. Maybe she needs to explain her need for alone time more clearly and reassure him that it's not about rejecting him, but about needing personal space. \n\nAlso, considering the husband's situation: he works part-time, doesn't go out much, and might have a hard time finding things to do. When she asks him to leave, he might feel like he's being pushed out of the home, especially if he doesn't have a strong social circle. The author might not realize the emotional impact of her request on him. \n\nHowever, the author's need for alone time is valid. People have different needs for personal space and introversion vs. extroversion. The problem arises when these needs clash. The husband's reaction seems extreme\u2014feeling that he can't have a relaxing weekend if he's not home on Saturday. But he does have other days free, like Friday and Monday. Maybe he's not using that time effectively or feels that the only time he can relax is on Saturday. \n\nThe fact that they can't move to a bigger apartment is a real challenge. They might need to work on finding a middle ground. Perhaps the author could explore other ways to get alone time without asking him to leave, like setting up a dedicated space in the apartment, even if it's a corner or a specific area. Alternatively, finding activities that they can do together but allow for some personal time in between. \n\nThe husband's insecurity about the home being his might also be a factor. He moved into her apartment two years ago, so maybe he hasn't adjusted to it being his home yet. The author might need to address this by involving him more in home decisions or making him feel more at home, which could help him be more open to her needing time to herself. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't in the wrong for needing alone time, especially in a marriage where both partners have different needs. However, the way she's approaching it might be contributing to the conflict. If her requests are framed as an ultimatum or without considering his feelings, that could be problematic. The husband's reaction is also an issue because he's taking it personally and not respecting her need for space. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting alone time. The problem is more about how their needs are communicated and respected. They need to find a solution that works for both of them. Therefore, the answer would be B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
