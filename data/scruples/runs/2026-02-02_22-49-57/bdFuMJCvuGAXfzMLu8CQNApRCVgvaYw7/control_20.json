I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple living in a studio apartment where the wife wants some alone time by asking her husband to leave for a few hours. The husband gets hurt and feels unwelcome. The user wants to know if the wife is wrong for asking this.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The key points are the studio apartment with no private space, the wife working full-time, the husband working part-time and being home a lot, leading to the wife needing alone time. She's asking him to leave so she can have some time to herself. The husband reacts negatively, feeling excluded. They haven't moved to a bigger place yet due to financial issues related to his job instability.\n\nSo, the question is whether the wife is in the wrong for making that request. Let's break it down. The wife has a legitimate need for personal space, which is important for mental health. Having no alone time in a studio apartment can be stressful. She's not asking for the entire day, just a couple of hours. The husband's job situation is less demanding, so he's home more, which might make the shared space more challenging.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband's reaction is hurtful. Feeling unwelcome in his own home is a strong sentiment. He might feel that his presence is a burden, especially if he's already at home a lot. The problem might be communication. The wife could be asking in a way that makes him feel like his presence is a problem, rather than expressing her need for space and including him in finding a solution.\n\nAlso, the husband's job stability and financial constraints are mentioned. They can't move to a bigger place yet, so the immediate solution is about managing their current living situation. The wife might need to consider compromise, like setting specific times for alone time that don't make the husband feel excluded. Maybe suggesting activities he can do on his own, or finding common time when they can each have some space without conflict.\n\nBut is the wife in the wrong? The act of asking for alone time isn't inherently wrong. Everyone needs personal space. However, the way she's communicating it might be an issue. If she's not considering his feelings or not finding a middle ground, that could be problematic. The husband's reaction is also a problem because he's taking it personally and not being supportive of her needs. The responsibility isn't entirely on the wife; it's a mutual issue. But the question is if the wife is in the wrong. Since she's expressing a legitimate need, but perhaps not in a way that considers his feelings, it's a bit of a gray area. However, in most cases, wanting personal space isn't wrong. The mistake might be in how she's handling the communication rather than the request itself. So likely, the answer is that she's not in the wrong. But I need to check if there are other factors. The husband's hurt feelings are valid, but the wife isn't being unreasonable. Therefore, the answer is B (No, she's not in the wrong).\n"
