I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple living in a studio apartment where the wife wants some alone time and asks her husband to leave for a few hours. The husband is upset about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. The author works full-time, and the husband works part-time. The studio apartment has no privacy, so she's asking for personal space. The husband feels hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome. He's not working much, so maybe he's home a lot, but she needs time to herself. \n\nThe key points are the need for personal space versus feeling unwelcome. The author isn't asking for days, just a couple of hours. The husband's reaction seems sensitive. Maybe he's used to living alone or needs more social interaction. But the author has a valid reason for needing alone time, especially in a small space. \n\nAlso, the fact that they can't move yet due to financial issues adds context. The husband's job is unstable, so moving isn't an option right now. The author isn't being selfish; she's asking for something reasonable. The husband's reaction might be more about his feelings of not belonging in the home. \n\nSo, I think the author is not in the wrong. She's advocating for her own needs in a situation where the living space is inherently cramped. The husband's feelings are valid, but the request seems fair. The answer should be B.\n"
