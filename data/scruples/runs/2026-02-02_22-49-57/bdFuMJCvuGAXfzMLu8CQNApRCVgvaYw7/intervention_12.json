I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a couple of hours. The scenario is a studio apartment with no alone time, and the husband works part-time, so he's home a lot. The author wants some personal space, but the husband feels hurt and not welcome.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is trying to get alone time, which is a reasonable need. Living in a studio apartment means shared space, but the husband's job situation is unstable, making it hard to move. The husband's reaction seems to be about feeling unwelcome, even though he's home often. The author is asking for specific hours, which the husband takes as a problem. \n\nOn one hand, needing personal space is normal. On the other, the husband's feelings of not being welcome might be valid if he's the one moving in. But the author has lived there longer and the husband's job is part-time. Maybe the husband should take initiative to find other things to do. But the author isn't unreasonable, just wants some time. The husband's response seems a bit over the top. The author isn't being selfish, just setting boundaries. So I think the answer is B, not in the wrong.\n"
