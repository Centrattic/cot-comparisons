I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for asking her husband to leave the apartment for a couple of hours. Let's consider the details.\n\nFirst, they live in a studio apartment, which inherently offers little privacy. The author values alone time, which is understandable. She works full-time, and her husband works fewer hours. He's home a lot and doesn't go out much. The author just wants a few hours of solitude on a Saturday afternoon. She's not avoiding him, but she needs personal space. \n\nThe husband reacts hurt, feeling unwelcome. He wants specific hours and activities, which might indicate he's feeling pushed to find time with friends. But the author is asking for a couple of hours, not a full day. Also, he's home alone on other days like Friday and Monday. The author isn't asking for a long period, just a short break.\n\nThey can't move yet due to financial issues. The husband is concerned about his weekend being ruined if he's not home Saturday. But the author is balancing her need for alone time with their current situation. The husband's reaction seems a bit over the top if he's home all day. The author isn't being selfish; she's seeking a reasonable amount of personal time in a cramped living situation. \n\nThe husband's response might be more about feeling rejected or insecure. The author's request is about her mental health and need for space, which is valid. Since they both have different needs, but the author's request is specific and not excessive, she's not in the wrong. The husband needs to respect her need for solitude, and maybe he should also work on his own social activities. So, the answer should be B.\n"
