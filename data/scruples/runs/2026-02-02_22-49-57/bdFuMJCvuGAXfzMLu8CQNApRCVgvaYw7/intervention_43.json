I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. The situation is a studio apartment where both live, and the husband works part-time. The author values alone time and wants some privacy, especially since they're in a small space. The husband feels hurt and doesn't feel welcome.\n\nFirst, the studio apartment setup means limited personal space. The author works full-time, so maybe they need some time to unwind. The husband's job is unstable, which complicates moving to a bigger place. The husband's reaction seems to be about feeling unwelcome, but he's home most of the time anyway. The author isn't asking for a lot\u2014just a couple hours on a Saturday. The husband's response seems a bit over the top, especially since he's home alone other days. It seems like the author is reasonable in their request for personal time, which is a common need in any relationship. The husband's feelings might stem from insecurity or not feeling included, but the author isn't doing anything wrong by seeking some alone time. So, probably the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
