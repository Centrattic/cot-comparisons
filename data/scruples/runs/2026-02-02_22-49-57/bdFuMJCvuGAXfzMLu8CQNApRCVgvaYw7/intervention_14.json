I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (the author) is in the wrong for asking her husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. They live in a studio, so space is tight. The author values alone time, which is understandable. She works full-time, the husband works part-time. He's home a lot, doesn't go out much. She wants some privacy.\n\nHusband's reaction is hurt, feeling unwelcome. He wants specifics on how long and what he should do. The author finds it confusing because he's home alone on other days. They can't move due to financial instability and housing issues.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, wanting alone time is normal. The problem arises in how the request is made. If she's being clear but he's taking it as rejection, maybe there's a communication issue. But the studio apartment situation makes alone time hard. The husband's emotional reaction might be more about feeling rejected than the actual request. The author isn't being unreasonable; it's about basic personal space. The husband might need to adjust or find other ways to spend time. Since the author isn't the one causing the conflict, just expressing a need, she's likely not in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
