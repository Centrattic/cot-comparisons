I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for asking her husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. The scenario is a studio apartment, so space is limited. Both are home a lot; she works full-time, he works part-time. She values alone time, which is hard to get in a studio. She asks him to leave sometimes, but he feels hurt and sees it as not his home. They can't move because of financial issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. The author wants personal time, which is a valid need. People need alone time for mental health. But the husband's reaction is hurt, feeling unwelcome. That's a conflict. The key points are: Is asking for a few hours alone reasonable? How does the husband's behavior and reaction factor in?\n\nThe author isn't being mean; she's trying to get some space. The husband's job is part-time, but he doesn't go out much. Maybe he feels neglected? But the author isn't refusing to spend time with him; she just needs some time alone. The problem seems more about communication and mutual understanding.\n\nThe husband's response is problematic because he's taking it personally and not respecting her needs. He's asking for exact hours and activities, which is unrealistic. The author isn't in the wrong for needing space. The issue is their communication and how they handle each other's needs. Since the author is trying to balance both their needs and the husband is not being cooperative, the fault isn't on her. So the answer should be B.\n"
