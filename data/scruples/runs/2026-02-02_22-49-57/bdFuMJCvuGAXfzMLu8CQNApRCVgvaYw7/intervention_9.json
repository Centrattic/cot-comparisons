I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. The key points here are the living situation, the dynamics between the couple, and their work schedules.\n\nFirst, they live in a studio apartment, which means there's no separate rooms. The wife works full-time, while the husband works 10-20 hours a week and spends a lot of time at home. She values alone time and wants a few hours to herself each Saturday. When she asks him to go out, he feels hurt and thinks he's not welcome. The husband's job is unstable, and they can't move to a bigger place right now because of financial issues.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to evaluate if her request is reasonable. She's asking for personal space, which is a basic need. The husband's reaction seems to stem from feeling like the apartment isn't his and that he's being excluded. However, he has plenty of free time each week, as mentioned on Fridays and Mondays. The problem might be communication or unmet expectations from the husband's side. The author isn't asking for excessive time or being selfish; she's just seeking some solitude. The husband's sensitivity might be about feeling undervalued or insecure in the relationship. Since they have plans for the future, like moving, maybe this is a temporary issue. So, the author's action seems justified, and the husband might need to adjust his expectations or communicate his feelings better. Therefore, she's not in the wrong.\n"
