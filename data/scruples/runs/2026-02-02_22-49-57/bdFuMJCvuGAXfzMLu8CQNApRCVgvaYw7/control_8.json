I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about the author asking her husband to leave the apartment for a couple of hours so she can have some alone time. They live in a studio apartment with no kids, and the husband works part-time. The husband is hurt and feels unwelcome when she asks for time alone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author values her alone time because they live in a small space, and she works full-time. It's a studio apartment, so privacy is limited. She's asking for a few hours of solitude, which is reasonable. On the other hand, the husband feels like he's not welcome in his own home when she asks him to leave. He might be feeling neglected or unappreciated, especially since he's home a lot and doesn't have many social activities. His job is unstable, so he might be struggling with identity or purpose, which could make his reaction more intense.\n\nIs the author in the wrong for wanting time to herself? Well, everyone needs personal space, especially in a small living situation. The fact that they don't have kids and the husband isn't working full-time might mean he's home more, which could lead to friction. But the husband's reaction seems overly hurt, possibly indicating deeper issues. The author isn't asking for a lot\u2014just a couple of hours. The husband's response of needing to know exact hours and what to do with his time might be a way to avoid the request, showing maybe he doesn't take responsibility for his own happiness.\n\nAlso, the author mentions that the husband has free time on other days, like Friday and Monday. So, the weekend isn't the only time he's home. They're also planning a day trip, so maybe the husband isn't getting enough time with her, but that's a different issue. The main point is about the author needing personal time. It's not unreasonable to ask for that, especially in a situation where the space is shared.\n\nLooking at the factors: communication is key here. The author might not be expressing her needs clearly enough, but the husband's reaction seems to stem from feeling unwelcome, which isn't the author's intention. However, the husband's job instability and lack of social activities might contribute to his feelings of resentment. The author isn't wrong for needing space; the problem might be in how the request is communicated or the underlying issues in their relationship.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for wanting alone time. It's a reasonable need. The husband's reaction might be more about his own insecurities or lack of engagement outside the home. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
