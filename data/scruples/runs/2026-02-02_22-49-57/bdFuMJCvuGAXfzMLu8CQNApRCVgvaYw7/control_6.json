I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a couple living in a studio apartment, and the author wants some alone time, so they ask their husband to leave for a couple hours. The husband reacts hurt, feeling unwelcome. The user wants to know if the author is at fault here.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The apartment is a studio, so space is limited. The author works full-time, while the husband works part-time. The husband doesn't go out much and doesn't have many friends. The author values alone time, which is something they loved about living alone before. They've been together for two years, and the husband hasn't adjusted to the space as his own. The author is trying to get some personal space, but the husband is taking it as a rejection.\n\nNow, the key points here are boundaries and communication. The author's need for alone time is valid. People have different needs for personal space, and in a studio apartment, it's harder. But the husband's reaction suggests he might feel insecure or not part of the home. The author isn't saying he can't use the apartment; they just want some time alone. However, the husband is interpreting it as not being welcome. There's a communication breakdown here. The author might not have explained their feelings clearly, leading to hurt feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband's feelings are real. If he's used to being alone (since he works part-time and doesn't go out much), having someone around all the time could be a new adjustment. The author might not be considering how this request affects him. The husband's job instability and the housing situation add stress, which could influence his reaction.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, they have a legitimate need for alone time, but how they're addressing it might need improvement. Instead of asking him to leave, maybe suggesting activities they can do separately in the apartment, or negotiating times when they can have alone time without making him feel excluded. The husband also needs to communicate his feelings better. The problem isn't entirely on one side; both need to work on communication. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they have the right to their own space and time, but the way they're asking is causing hurt, maybe there's some fault on both sides. But the primary issue is the husband's reaction. The author isn't wrong for needing space, but perhaps their approach could be adjusted. However, the husband's hurt feelings are a result of not feeling included, which is also a valid point. Considering all this, the answer might be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because their need for alone time is valid, but they should communicate better. Alternatively, maybe A (Yes) if the approach is causing more harm. Hmm. The husband's reaction is over the top, but the author's request is reasonable. The answer is likely B.\n"
