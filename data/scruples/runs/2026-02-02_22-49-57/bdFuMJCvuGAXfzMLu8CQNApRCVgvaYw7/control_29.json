I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking her husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. So, the scenario is they live in a studio apartment, which doesn't have separate rooms, so they're always together. The author wants some alone time, which she used to have when living alone. She's working full-time, while her husband works fewer hours and isn't out much. When she asks him to leave, he gets hurt and feels unwelcome. They can't move to a bigger place because of financial issues.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider both sides. The author's need for alone time is valid. People have different needs for personal space. She's not asking for a long time, just a couple of hours. But her husband feels it's his home too, and she's making him leave. He's sensitive about it, maybe because he's used to being home a lot and doesn't have many social outlets. His reaction is emotional\u2014he feels not welcome. The author might not realize that her request is affecting his feelings. \n\nBut then again, she has a legitimate need. The problem is the communication. Maybe she hasn't explained her feelings properly, or he hasn't expressed his feelings of needing to be present. The husband's job situation is unstable, which might add to his stress. If he's not working much, being home is his norm. The author is trying to balance her need for space with his feelings. \n\nThe key points here are mutual understanding and communication. The author isn't wrong for needing alone time, but maybe she could approach it differently. However, the husband's reaction is also a problem\u2014he's taking it personally and not being flexible. The author is in a right to ask for some time, especially since he's home a lot. The financial situation complicates moving, so they need to find a middle ground. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. She's asking for reasonable alone time, and the issue is more about their communication and his emotional response. It's a common issue in close living situations, and both need to work on understanding each other's needs better. But the author isn't wrong per se.\n"
