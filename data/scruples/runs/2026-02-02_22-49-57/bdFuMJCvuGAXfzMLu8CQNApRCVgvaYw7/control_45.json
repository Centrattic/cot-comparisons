I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple living in a studio apartment, which doesn't have much space. The author works full-time, while her husband works only 10-20 hours a week. They don't have kids. The author values alone time and sometimes asks her husband to leave for a couple of hours to have privacy. However, the husband feels hurt and doesn't feel welcomed in his own home when she asks.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is asking for personal space, which is a common need. Living in a studio apartment without a separate room means they're constantly in each other's presence. Even though they both have time at home, the author might need some solitude to recharge. On the other hand, the husband works part-time and might feel like he's not as busy. If he's home a lot, maybe he's used to being around, and the author's request for time alone seems like him being unwanted. That could hurt his feelings, especially if he doesn't have many social outlets.\n\nThe husband's reaction of feeling unwelcome is important. It's possible that his emotional response is a sign that he's sensitive about his role in the relationship or his self-esteem. The author might not be aware that her request is making him feel this way. It's also mentioned that he doesn't have many friends to hang out with, so when she asks, he might feel like he has to find something to do just to get out, which could feel forced or like he's being rejected.\n\nThe author is not asking for a huge amount of time, just a couple of hours. There are other days when he's home alone, like Friday and Monday, so maybe he's not using that time to do things he enjoys. It could be that he doesn't have hobbies or activities to occupy himself when alone, so when the author asks, it's a problem because he doesn't have a plan. The author might not realize that his discomfort isn't just about her asking but also about his own habits.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author has a right to need personal space. It's a common need, and it's not unreasonable to ask for a few hours alone in a shared space. However, the way the husband is reacting might indicate that they need to communicate better about their needs. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting time to herself, but maybe she could approach the request more sensitively, perhaps to understand why he feels that way. The husband might need to work on his feelings of being unwelcome and perhaps find more activities to do when alone, rather than taking it personally.\n\nThe fact that they can't move to a bigger apartment right now due to financial reasons adds another layer. The author is dealing with the constraints of their living situation without being able to change it yet. So, she's trying to manage within the current setup, which is understandable.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for wanting alone time, which is a normal need. The issue lies more in the husband's emotional response and how they communicate their needs to each other. The author's request is reasonable, and it's up to both partners to find a solution that works for both.\n"
