I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is she asks her husband to leave the studio apartment for a few hours so she can have some alone time. The apartment is small, no privacy, both work but he works less hours. She wants time alone, which he interprets as not being welcome.\n\nFirst, is it reasonable for her to want alone time? Studio apartments are known for having no privacy. Since they both work but his hours are part-time, he's home more. She values alone time, which is a common need. So asking him to leave for a few hours seems like a reasonable request for self-care.\n\nHe reacts by feeling hurt and questioning the exact time and what he should do. That seems like a defensive reaction. If he's home all the time anyway, maybe he's used to that and doesn't want to leave, even if it's for his own good. But does that mean she's wrong to ask? Probably not. She's not asking him to do something harmful; just to go out for a few hours. His friends might not have time, but maybe he could go for a walk or something else. \n\nThe fact that she's been living with him for two years and he still doesn't feel it's his home might indicate some deeper issues. Maybe he's not adapting well to the living situation. But that doesn't put the blame on her. She's explaining her needs, which are valid. Also, they're planning to move when his job situation improves, so she's considering the future.\n\nHe's upset about the day trip and Saturday plans, but he has free time on other days. It seems like he's prioritizing his own feelings over her need for space. The key here is whether her request is unreasonable. Since the apartment is small and they live in a big city, moving isn't an option yet. Her need for alone time is understandable.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. She's asserting her need for personal space, which is reasonable. His reaction is more about his own feelings of insecurity or lack of adjustment. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
