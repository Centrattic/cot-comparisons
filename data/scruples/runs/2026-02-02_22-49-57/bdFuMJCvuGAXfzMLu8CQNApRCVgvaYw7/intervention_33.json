I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking her husband to leave the apartment for a couple of hours. They live in a studio apartment, which means no privacy. The author wants some alone time because she's used to living alone. The husband works part-time and isn't out much, so he's home a lot. When she asks him to go out, he gets hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author has a valid need for personal space, especially since she's used to being alone. Studio apartments are tough because they don't offer much privacy. On the other hand, the husband feels hurt and sees it as not being welcomed. He might feel neglected or unappreciated. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual understanding. The author is asking for her space, which is reasonable, but she might need to approach it in a way that doesn't make her husband feel unwelcome. Maybe setting boundaries without making it about \"his\" home versus \"hers\" could help. The husband's reaction suggests he might have deeper insecurities or needs for social interaction that aren't being met. \n\nThe situation also mentions that they can't move due to financial issues. So, they have to work with their current living situation. The husband's job instability adds another layer of stress. It's possible he feels insecure about his role or stability, which might make him more sensitive to requests for alone time.\n\nThe author isn't wrong for needing space, but maybe she could communicate better. Explaining the need without making it sound like a rejection of him might help. The husband, however, also needs to consider her need for privacy. It's a balance. Since the author is asking if she's in the wrong, the answer would likely be no, but there's room for both to adjust their approach. So the answer is B.\n"
