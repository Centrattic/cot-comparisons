I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong for asking her husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. They live in a studio apartment, so space is limited. The author values alone time, which is something she's always appreciated. Her husband works part-time, so he's around more. When she asks him to leave, he gets hurt and feels unwelcome.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author has a valid need for personal space, which is important for mental well-being. Studio apartments can be tough for couples without kids because there's no private area. The husband's reaction seems to be about feeling excluded or not valued, maybe even a sense of not belonging in the shared space. But is that a valid reason to refuse to leave for a few hours?\n\nThe husband's job is unstable, and they can't move yet due to financial constraints. So they're in a tough situation, but that doesn't mean the author's request is unreasonable. The key here is communication and mutual understanding. The author is trying to maintain her mental health by having some time alone, which is a normal need. However, the husband's hurt feelings might stem from feeling that his presence is a burden rather than a problem with the living situation.\n\nIs the author wrong for asserting her need? Probably not. Everyone needs alone time. However, the way the request is made could be a factor. If she's clear and considerate, explaining her need without making him feel rejected, that's better. But the problem here is more about his reaction than her request. The author isn't at fault for needing space, especially in a studio apartment. The husband might need to find ways to manage his time alone or seek activities on his own. So the answer should be B\u2014she's not in the wrong.\n"
