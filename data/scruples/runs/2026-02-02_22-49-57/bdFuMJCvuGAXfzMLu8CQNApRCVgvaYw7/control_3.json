I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. The situation is that they live in a studio apartment, so there's no privacy. The husband works part-time and isn't out much, so the author wants some alone time. The husband gets hurt and feels unwelcome when she asks him to leave.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a valid need for personal space, especially since they're in a studio and there's no alone time. She values her privacy and has always liked living alone. But the husband is taking her request personally, feeling like he's not welcome in his own home. That's a problem because he's supposed to feel comfortable there. \n\nShe's not asking for a lot\u2014just a couple of hours on a Saturday. He's home a lot anyway, so maybe he's not using his time well. But his reaction is emotional, which might stem from feeling insecure or not adjusted to living together. The author's request isn't unreasonable, but maybe she's not addressing his feelings. However, the husband's job is unstable, and moving isn't an option yet. \n\nI should also think about communication. The author might need to explain her need better, but he's not meeting her halfway by finding friends to spend time with. He's not taking initiative to manage his time. The author isn't wrong for wanting space; it's a common issue in close quarters. The husband's reaction is more about his feelings of being unappreciated. So the author isn't in the wrong here. Answer B.\n"
