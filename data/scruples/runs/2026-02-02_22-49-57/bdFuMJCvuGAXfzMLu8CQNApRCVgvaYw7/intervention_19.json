I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a couple living in a studio apartment where the wife feels the need to ask her husband to leave for a few hours to have alone time. The husband takes it personally and feels unwelcome.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze both sides. The wife works full-time and values her alone time, which makes sense given the small living space. She's not asking for a lot, just a couple of hours. The husband, on the other hand, works less and spends more time at home. He's hurt because he feels like the apartment isn't his home anymore. He's also not really engaging with friends, so maybe he's feeling isolated too. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual needs. The wife has a valid need for personal space, especially in a studio where alone time isn't easy. But the husband's reaction suggests he might be feeling insecure or neglected. The question is whether her asking for time alone is unreasonable given their living situation.\n\nI should consider if asking a partner to leave for a few hours is within the realm of normal requests in a relationship. Since they don't have kids and he has a lot of free time, maybe the husband could find other ways to spend time. But he's not meeting friends often, so maybe he's not used to being out. The wife is trying to balance her need for space with his presence. \n\nThe husband's job situation is unstable, so moving isn't an option right now. So the wife's request is a temporary solution. The problem seems to be more about communication and understanding each other's needs rather than one party being wrong. \n\nI think the wife isn't in the wrong. She's expressing her need for alone time, which is reasonable. The issue is more about how the husband is responding and their communication. So the answer should be B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
