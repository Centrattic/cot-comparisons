I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author lives in a studio apartment with her husband. She wants some alone time, so she asks him to leave for a few hours. He gets hurt and feels unwelcome. They don't have kids, and he works fewer hours. The main issue seems to be about space and time in a small living area.\n\nFirst, the author's reasoning: she values alone time and has a full-time job. She tries to give him opportunities to go out (suggesting meeting friends on Saturday), but he doesn't take them. He reacts negatively when she asks for time alone. The husband's job is unstable, which complicates moving to a bigger place. \n\nI need to consider both perspectives. The author has a right to personal space, especially in a shared living situation. But the husband might feel that his need for a relaxing home environment is being neglected. However, the author isn't asking him to leave every day; just a couple of hours on a Saturday afternoon. She's also trying to accommodate his social life by suggesting meeting friends. \n\nThe husband's reaction seems more about feeling excluded rather than the act of being asked to leave. He might be struggling with the transition of moving in and not feeling it's his home. But the author is the one who has to balance her own needs with his. Since they can't move yet, they have to find solutions. The key is whether her request is unreasonable. She's not asking for a lot, just a few hours. The husband's response of getting hurt and questioning how many hours she needs seems to overreact, implying maybe he's not considering her need for alone time. \n\nSo, the author is trying to maintain her mental health and personal space, which is valid. The husband's reaction might stem from insecurity or lack of understanding. Since the author is the one initiating the request respectfully and the husband is not meeting his own social needs, the author isn't in the wrong. The answer should be B.\n"
