I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about asking her husband to leave their studio apartment for a couple of hours so she can have some alone time. They live in a studio, which has no separate rooms, so when both are home, they're always together. The author works full-time, while her husband works part-time, so he's home more. She values alone time, which is understandable. She's tried suggesting he meet friends or go out, but he gets hurt and feels unwelcome. She's thinking about the possibility of moving to a bigger place, but that's not feasible right now due to financial issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author is asking for personal space, which is a basic need. In a studio apartment, having someone constantly around can be draining. She's not asking for a lot of time, just a couple of hours. On the other hand, her husband feels that when she asks him to leave, it makes their home feel like not his. He might feel that his presence is being rejected, especially since he's already home a lot. He might be struggling with feelings of loneliness or not being included in the household dynamics.\n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual understanding. The author isn't wrong for needing alone time, as everyone has the right to personal space. However, maybe there's a way to approach this without making her husband feel unwelcome. Perhaps setting up a compromise, like specific times when she needs space, or finding activities they can do together that allow her some independence. The husband's reaction suggests deeper feelings of insecurity or not feeling part of the home. He might need reassurance that he's valued in the relationship.\n\nFinancial constraints prevent moving to a bigger place, so they have to work with what they have. The author could explore other ways to create alone time, like setting up a quiet corner for herself or scheduling his outings on days when she doesn't need space. However, the problem isn't just about the space but how they handle their needs. If the husband is truly hurt and reacts negatively, the author might need to address his feelings more directly, ensuring he knows that her request for alone time isn't a rejection of him but a need for personal well-being.\n\nIn conclusion, the author isn't in the wrong for needing personal space. It's a natural and healthy need. The issue might lie in how the request is communicated and how the husband perceives it. Both need to work on communication to balance each other's needs without feeling neglected or unappreciated.\n"
