I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple living in a studio apartment. The author wants some alone time, so they ask their husband to leave for a few hours. The husband gets hurt and feels unwelcome. The question is whether the author is wrong for asking this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. They live in a studio, which is small, so personal space is limited. The author works full-time, while the husband works part-time. The husband is home a lot and doesn't have many friends. The author values alone time and has always liked living alone. When they ask for time alone, the husband gets upset and feels it's not his home. The author also mentions that the husband isn't working much and the financial situation makes moving to a bigger place difficult.\n\nSo, the main points are: the author's need for personal space vs. the husband's feelings of not being welcome. The author isn't unreasonable in wanting time to themselves, especially in a small space. However, the way the request is made might affect how the husband feels. The husband's reaction is about feeling excluded, maybe not understanding the necessity. The author is trying to balance their own needs with the husband's comfort. Since the husband has a lot of free time and the author isn't asking for a long time each day, it's a reasonable request. The husband's hurt feelings might be due to feeling that his presence is a burden. The author isn't in the wrong because they have a valid need, and the husband's job situation is unstable, so moving isn't an option right now. The problem is more about communication and mutual understanding rather than the author being at fault. So, the answer is B.\n"
