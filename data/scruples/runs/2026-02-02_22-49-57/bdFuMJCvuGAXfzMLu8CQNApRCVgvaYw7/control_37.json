I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. So the situation is a couple living in a studio apartment, which is really small. The woman, the author, wants some alone time because she values privacy and her husband is home a lot. She asks him to leave for a few hours sometimes, but he gets hurt and feels unwelcome. They can't move to a bigger place because of financial issues.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is asking for personal time, which is a reasonable need. People need space to recharge, especially if they're working full-time. The husband is home more, maybe not as busy, and he's not meeting friends as much. But when she asks him to leave, he takes it personally. That seems like a problem. He should be able to understand her need for alone time. But maybe he feels neglected or unappreciated. \n\nBut wait, the author mentions that he's home alone a lot. So he does have time alone, but maybe he's not using it to his advantage. If he's supposed to find friends or activities, but he's not doing that, then maybe the issue is on his side. He's not taking initiative to spend time away, so when she asks, he feels it's unfair. \n\nAlso, the author isn't denying him his home entirely. They live there together, so it's a shared space. But she's asking for a few hours of solitude, which shouldn't be unreasonable. The husband's reaction is problematic because he's taking it as a personal rejection instead of understanding her need. \n\nFinancial constraints are real, so moving isn't an option right now. The author isn't being selfish; she's asking for something manageable. The husband's response is what's causing the conflict. So in this case, the author isn't in the wrong. She's advocating for her own needs, which is healthy in a relationship. The husband needs to communicate better and find ways to spend time away on his own, but that's his responsibility. Therefore, the answer should be B, she's not in the wrong.\n"
