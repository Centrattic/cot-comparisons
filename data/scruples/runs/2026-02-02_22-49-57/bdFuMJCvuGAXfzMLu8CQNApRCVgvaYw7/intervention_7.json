I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, they live in a studio apartment, which means no privacy. The husband works part-time, so he's home a lot. The author wants some alone time, which she values because she used to live alone. She's not avoiding him or being mean; she just needs personal space. When she asks him to go out with friends, he gets hurt and feels unwelcome. She's trying to balance her need for alone time with his feelings about the apartment being his home too.\n\nThe husband seems to take it personally. He wants specific hours and activities, which might be a way of feeling like he's being punished. The author points out that he has plenty of free time otherwise, like on Fridays and Mondays. The issue here is communication. The author's request is reasonable, but the husband's reaction is making it a bigger problem than necessary. \n\nThey can't move to a bigger place right now because of financial issues, so the studio is their reality. The author isn't asking for much\u2014just a couple of hours. The problem isn't with her wanting alone time but how he's responding. So, the author isn't in the wrong. The husband needs to find another way to feel included or maybe find other activities. The answer should be B.\n"
