I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for asking her husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. They live in a studio apartment, which is small, so no alone time. The author values her alone time, which makes sense. She works full-time, and her husband works part-time, so he's home more. She wants some time to herself, but when she asks him to go out, he gets hurt and feels unwelcome. The user wants to know if the author is wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has a valid need for personal space. Living in a studio with someone else, especially when one person is home more, can lead to feeling like there's no privacy. It's important for mental health to have some alone time. On the other hand, the husband feels like he's being asked to leave his own home, which he doesn't have. He might feel neglected or unimportant, especially if he's already home most of the time. His job is unstable, so maybe he's also feeling insecure about his situation.\n\nThe author mentions that the husband doesn't have friends to go out with, so when she asks him to meet friends, he can't. That might add to his frustration. He feels like the only time he gets to relax is the weekend, and if he can't go out then, it's all taken up. The author might not realize that he's not just being difficult but might have his own issues with feeling isolated or not having a good work-life balance.\n\nThe user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). The key points are mutual needs: the author needs alone time, the husband needs to feel at home. The problem seems to be communication. The author's request is reasonable, but the husband's reaction is problematic. However, maybe the author could find a compromise, like specific times when they can have alone time without making it feel like he's being kicked out. But the author isn't wrong in wanting her space. The husband's feelings are valid too, but it's not entirely the author's fault. The situation is complex, but the author's need for personal space isn't unreasonable. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
