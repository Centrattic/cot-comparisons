I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the situation is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. They live in a studio apartment with no alone time, and the husband works part-time, so he's around a lot. The author wants some time alone but the husband feels hurt and doesn't want to leave.\n\nFirst, the author's request is about needing personal space. That's a common issue in close living situations. The studio apartment setup means they're always together, which can be draining. The author works full-time, so after work, needing some time to themselves makes sense. The husband, though, is home more and feels like he's not welcome. He's getting hurt when asked to leave, which suggests he might feel neglected or unappreciated.\n\nThe husband's job is unstable, and they can't move to a bigger place right now. So the author is constrained by financial and logistical factors. The husband's reaction might stem from feeling that his presence is a burden. But the author isn't asking for him to leave all the time, just a couple of hours on a Saturday. The husband also has other days when he's alone, like Friday and Monday. The author is trying to balance their needs, but the husband's emotional response complicates things.\n\nCommunication seems like a key issue here. The author might not be in the wrong because they're expressing a legitimate need for personal space. However, the way the request is made and the husband's reaction could affect the dynamic. The husband's feeling of not being welcome is important too. But given that the author is trying to negotiate and the husband's job situation is a factor, the author isn't necessarily wrong. The problem is more about communication and mutual understanding rather than one person being at fault. So the answer is B.\n"
