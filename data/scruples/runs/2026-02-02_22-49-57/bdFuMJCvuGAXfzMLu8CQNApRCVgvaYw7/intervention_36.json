I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. The scenario is a studio apartment with both working, but the husband works fewer hours. The wife values alone time, which the husband seems to take as her not wanting him there at all. The key points are the studio apartment's lack of space, the husband's job situation, and the communication issues.\n\nFirst, the wife has a valid need for alone time. In a studio, privacy is hard. She's working full-time and wants personal time, which is normal. The husband, on the other hand, feels hurt and unwelcome when she asks to be alone. He's home a lot because he works part-time, but maybe he's not used to being in a shared space. His reaction seems more about his feelings of not belonging rather than the actual request. \n\nThe husband's job is unstable, and they can't move yet because of financial issues. The wife isn't asking for a lot\u2014just a few hours on a Saturday. The problem seems to be their communication. The husband is taking her request personally, interpreting it as rejection or exclusion. The wife is trying to express her need for personal space, which is reasonable. \n\nThe user thinks the author is not in the wrong. I agree. The issue isn't the request itself but how it's being communicated and the husband's feelings. The wife is justified in wanting alone time, especially given the living situation. The husband needs to address his feelings of not belonging and maybe find other ways to spend time or build a better sense of home. So, the answer should be B.\n"
