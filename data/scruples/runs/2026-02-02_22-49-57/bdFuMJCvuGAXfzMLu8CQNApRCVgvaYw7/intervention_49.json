I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So the question is whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for asking her husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. \n\nFirst, the situation: They live in a studio apartment, which gives them no alone time. She works full-time, he works part-time (10-20 hours a week). He's home a lot, doesn't go out much or see friends. She wants some alone time, so she asks him to leave for a couple hours. He gets hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome. She's tried suggesting he meet friends, but he's resistant. They can't move to a bigger place because of his unstable job and high city rents.\n\nSo, the main points here are about personal space and differing needs. She values alone time, which is understandable. He feels neglected or unwelcome when she asks him to leave. Communication is key here. The author is asking for time to herself, which is a reasonable need, but the way she's approaching it might be causing hurt feelings. \n\nIs she in the wrong? Well, needing alone time isn't wrong. The problem might be in how she's communicating her needs. If he's feeling like the apartment isn't his, maybe they need to work on cohabitation dynamics. But the fact that he's home so much and not engaging in activities might contribute to the conflict. She's not being unreasonable by wanting alone time. The husband's reaction seems to be an emotional response rather than a valid reason to say she's wrong. \n\nAlso, the husband's job situation and their financial constraints are factors. They can't move, so they have to find a solution in their current setup. The author isn't in the wrong for wanting her space. The issue is more about how they handle the request and find a middle ground. So I think the answer is B.\n"
