I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. The scenario is a studio apartment where both live, and the husband works part-time, so he's around a lot. The author wants some alone time, but the husband feels hurt and thinks the apartment isn't his home. They can't move yet due to financial issues.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the fairness of the request. The author is asking for a couple of hours alone, which seems reasonable. Everyone needs personal space, especially in a studio. The husband, however, is taking it personally and feeling unwelcome. His reaction seems to be more about feeling excluded rather than the actual need for alone time. The author isn't asking him to leave all the time, just occasionally. \n\nThe husband's response is problematic. He's not addressing the root issue (the need for space) but instead focusing on the number of hours and what he should do. That seems like deflecting. Also, he's available on other days to be alone, like Friday and Monday, so his complaint about not having a relaxing weekend doesn't hold up. \n\nThe author isn't in the wrong because they're setting a boundary for their well-being. The husband's job situation and their financial constraints don't justify him not respecting her need for alone time. The key here is communication. The author is trying to find a balance, which is normal. The husband's hurt feelings are a reaction to the request, not the request itself. \n\nSo, the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong. They're asking for a reasonable amount of personal space, and the husband's response is the issue here.\n"
