I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that she's living in a studio apartment with her husband, which doesn't give them much alone time. She wants some time to herself, so she asks him to leave for a few hours on a Saturday afternoon. He feels hurt and thinks she's making him leave her home, even though she's okay being home alone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. She values her alone time and has a valid reason, especially since she works full time and he's home more. The studio apartment setup makes it hard to have privacy. On the other hand, he might feel rejected or like he's not part of the home, especially if he's been there for two years and it still doesn't feel like his place. His job is unstable and he's not working many hours, so maybe being home is the only routine he has. He's also pointing out that he's home alone on other days, but when she asks him to leave specifically on Saturday, he's upset. \n\nThe key points here are communication and mutual respect. She wants alone time, which is a reasonable need. However, the way she's asking might be causing him to feel unwelcome. If he's not meeting friends often, maybe he doesn't have many outlets to use when she asks him to leave. The husband's feelings of not having a relaxing weekend if he can't stay on Saturday might be valid too. \n\nBut the author is not asking him to leave every weekend or indefinitely. It's just a couple of hours on a Saturday afternoon. She's also considering their financial situation, as moving to a bigger place isn't an option right now. So her request is temporary and specific. \n\nIn terms of fault, maybe the issue is more about how they communicate their needs. The husband's reaction might be a result of not feeling secure in the living arrangement or his role in the relationship. But the author isn't in the wrong for wanting her own time. It's a common issue in close living situations. The real problem might be the lack of communication and understanding each other's needs. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because her request is reasonable and stems from a need for personal space. However, both could work on better communication to address each other's feelings without making the other feel guilty or excluded.\n"
