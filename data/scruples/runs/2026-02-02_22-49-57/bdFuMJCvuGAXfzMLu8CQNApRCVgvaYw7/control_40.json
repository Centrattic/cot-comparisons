I will sometimes go to the kitchen to bake/ hang out but usually we are in the same room. I work full time and he works only 10-20 hours a week which gives him plenty of time home alone (we don't have kids). He doesn't go out a lot or meets friends often so he really is usually home when I'm home. It's not like I can't read a book with him in the room or watch shows he doesn't want to watch but it is just a different feeling when you are completely alone. I have always valued that and loved living alone.\n\nHe moved in to my apartment almost 2 years ago and I guess it still doesn't feel like his apartment yet. Whenever I ask him to meet his friends or find something to do so I could have a couple of hours to myself on a Saturday afternoon, he gets really hurt and says he doesn't feel welcome in his own home. Then he wants me to specify exactly how many hours I need and what he is supposed to do outside when his friends don't have time for him.\n\nThis Sunday we're going on a day trip to the sea and he said if in addition he can't be home on Saturday, he doesn't really have a relaxing weekend at all. But he his home alone all day today (Friday) and he probably doesn't have to work on Monday either... I don't understand his problem there as he has plenty of free time every week.\n\nRegarding finding a bigger apartment: So far we have not been able to move because his job situation is so unstable and he is not making much money. And we live in a big city where affordable housing is almost non existent. We hope his situation will change this year and we can move then.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for asking their husband to leave the apartment for a few hours. They live in a studio apartment, so space is limited. The husband works part-time, and the author works full-time. The main issue is that the author wants some alone time, but the husband feels hurt and doesn't take it well when she asks him to leave.\n\nFirst, the author wants some personal space, which is a reasonable need. People need alone time to relax and do their own things. The husband, on the other hand, seems to feel that the apartment is his home as well, and when asked to leave, he feels unwelcome. His reaction is emotional, getting hurt and wanting specifics about how long and what to do. He also brings up the day trip and the weekend, which seems to be about his own need for relaxation. \n\nThe husband's job situation is unstable, which adds to the financial stress of moving to a bigger place. They can't afford to move right now. The author is in a studio apartment, which doesn't have much space, making it hard for both to have privacy. \n\nSo, is the author wrong? Well, asking for alone time isn't unreasonable. Everyone needs personal space. The husband's reaction seems to be more about feeling rejected or unappreciated. Maybe he feels that his presence is a burden, but that's a different issue. The author isn't being selfish by wanting time alone. The problem is more on the husband's side in how he's reacting. The author isn't in the wrong for having a need that's not being met. The husband might need to adjust to the living situation and find ways to be okay with the author having personal time without taking it personally. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No), the author is not in the wrong.\n"
