We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for getting upset with their girlfriend because she cancels plans when she's on her period.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend's behavior: she's on her period for the first two days and cancels everything. The user plans a special date night, but she cancels it. He mentions that he's aware she's dealing with cramps and usually puts up with it, but this time he's frustrated. He says he's not angry but passive-aggressive, comparing her to other women he's lived with who didn't act this way. The girlfriend reacts extremely emotionally, calling him names and crying, leading to a breakdown in communication.\n\nNow, the key points here. The user's frustration is understandable, but the way he expressed it might be the issue. Comparing his current girlfriend to others he's had, even if not directly confrontational, can come off as dismissive of her feelings. Saying that other women \"don't act like this\" implies that she's not handling it correctly, which can be hurtful. The girlfriend's strong reaction suggests that this comparison was a trigger for her. \n\nCommunication style is crucial here. Passive-aggressive comments, even if not shouted, can be deeply hurtful. The user's statement about other women might have made her feel judged or not supported. Even if his intention was to express frustration, the method wasn't constructive. Relationships require mutual understanding and support, especially during health issues. The user's approach might have undermined her feelings and needs, leading to her emotional outburst.\n\nSo, while the user's frustration is relatable, the way he communicated it was likely inconsiderate. He's in the wrong because his comment was a comparison that invalidated her experience, leading to a harmful reaction. The answer should be A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because his response was not supportive and contributed to the conflict.\n"
