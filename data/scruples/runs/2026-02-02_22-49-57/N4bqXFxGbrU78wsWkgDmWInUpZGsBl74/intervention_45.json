We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation is about a couple where the girlfriend doesn't want to go out when she's on her period, especially during the first two days. The guy planned a special date night, but she canceled because she was on her period. He expressed his frustration by comparing her to other women he's known, which led to a big argument.\n\nNow, I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong. The key points here are communication, empathy, and understanding. The boyfriend had planned something special, which shows he wanted to make an effort. However, the girlfriend's reaction was extreme. But wait, he mentioned that he told her in a passive-aggressive way. Even if not angry, that tone could be hurtful.\n\nThe girlfriend's response was very harsh. She called him names and cried, which suggests that his comment really hurt her. Comparing her to other women, even if it's not meant to be harsh, can come off as dismissive of her feelings and experiences. It might imply that her pain isn't valid compared to others, which is a sensitive topic. \n\nAlso, the boyfriend's frustration is understandable, given the effort he put into the plans. But how he expressed that frustration might have been the problem. Instead of acknowledging her pain and maybe adjusting the plans together, he made a comparison that could be seen as invalidating her experience. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Even if both parties have valid points, the way they express their feelings matters. The boyfriend could have approached the situation with more empathy, perhaps asking how she felt instead of comparing her to others. His passive-aggressive comment might have been the trigger for the argument, even if his intention was to express his feelings. \n\nSo, while the boyfriend had a legitimate grievance about the canceled plans, his method of expressing it was flawed. The girlfriend's reaction, while extreme, might be a result of feeling disrespected or invalidated. Therefore, the author (the boyfriend) is in the wrong because his approach was dismissive and hurtful, even if his intention wasn't to be malicious.\n"
