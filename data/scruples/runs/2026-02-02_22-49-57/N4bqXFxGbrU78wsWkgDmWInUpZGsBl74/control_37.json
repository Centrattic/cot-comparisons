We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and his girlfriend have been living together for three months. She's usually laid back but during her period, she cancels plans and stays home. The author had planned a special date night, but she canceled because she started her period. He told her that other women he's known don't act this way, implying she should put in more effort. She reacted angrily, called him names, cried, and they haven't talked since. The author is confused about whether he did something wrong.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. From what I know about periods, they can cause physical discomfort, cramps, fatigue, etc. It's common for some women to feel less like doing things on their heaviest days. The author had planned this date weeks in advance, and she knew about it. However, she might have been in physical pain, making it hard to go out. \n\nThe key here is his response. He said that other women he's lived with don't act this way. Comparing his current partner to others can be hurtful. Even if he wasn't angry, saying that others don't behave this way could make her feel criticized. She might feel like her pain isn't being acknowledged. The author's comment might come off as dismissive of her experience, which is valid. \n\nCommunication is crucial in relationships. Instead of comparing her to others, he could have expressed his feelings without undermining her. For example, he could have said he felt disappointed but still supports her. However, his approach was passive-aggressive and brought up comparisons, which likely hurt her feelings. \n\nHer reaction was intense, but that might stem from feeling attacked. If she's usually kind, a harsh reaction suggests that his words really hurt her. He might not have considered her perspective, thinking she could \"push through\" the pain, but that's not realistic for everyone. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author's approach was flawed. He had a valid feeling of disappointment but expressed it in a way that invalidated her experience. The right approach would be empathy and finding a middle ground next time instead of making comparisons. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because he dismissed her needs and used comparisons, which can be damaging in a relationship.\n"
