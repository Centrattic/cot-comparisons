We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is upset with his girlfriend for canceling plans when she's on her period. He had plans for a special date night, but she called it off because she was on her period. He made a comment comparing her to other women he's lived with who don't act like that, and she got really angry, crying and yelling.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's main issue is that his girlfriend cancels plans when she's on her period, which he finds inconvenient. He plans something special, she cancels, and he comments on her behavior in a passive-aggressive way. She reacts strongly, and now he's wondering if he was wrong.\n\nSo, from a general perspective, when someone is on their period, it's common for women to experience cramps, fatigue, or other discomforts. While not all women are affected the same way, it's a valid reason for some people to feel unwell. The author seems to understand that she has cramps but is frustrated by the unpredictability and the canceling of plans. However, his approach here is problematic. He made a passive-aggressive comment implying that other women don't act this way, which is a form of comparison that can be hurtful. Comparing his current partner to past partners is a classic no-no in relationships and can come off as dismissive of her feelings and experiences.\n\nHe had planned the date knowing about her period cycle, but she might have had an unexpected start. However, the key issue is his reaction. Even if he's not angry, his comment was still critical and could be seen as invalidating her feelings. By saying others don't act like that, he's undermining her needs and implying that her reaction is excessive. This could make her feel unappreciated and unsupported during a time when she's already feeling unwell.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction, while intense, is a sign that his words really hurt her. She felt criticized and possibly devalued. Communication is crucial here. Instead of making comparisons, the author could have expressed his feelings without blaming her, perhaps finding a way to adjust the plans together or offering support. However, his approach was to point out her shortcomings in a way that's likely to cause defensiveness.\n\nIn terms of fault, the author's passive-aggressive comment was the direct cause of the argument. While it's understandable to feel frustrated when plans are canceled, the way he expressed his frustration was inappropriate. The girlfriend's response, while strong, is a valid emotional reaction to being criticized. The author's actions were hurtful and contributed to the conflict. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for making that comment and not handling the situation with empathy and understanding.\n"
