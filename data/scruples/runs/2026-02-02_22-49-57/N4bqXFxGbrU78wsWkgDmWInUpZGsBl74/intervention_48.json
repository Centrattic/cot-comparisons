We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend doesn't want to do anything for the first two days of her period, even if they have plans. The author planned a special date night, but she canceled last minute because her period started. He told her that other women he's known don't act like that, implying she could put in more effort. She reacted very angrily, and now they're not talking.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants to know the opinion. The options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong). \n\nHmm. Let me break it down. The key points here are communication, expectations, and empathy. The author had planned a special night and was disappointed. However, he chose to make a comparison to other women, which can be hurtful. Even if he wasn't angry, using passive-aggressive comments about others might come off as dismissive of her feelings and health.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction suggests that her period is causing her significant discomfort. Cramps can be really painful and unpredictable, especially if her cycle is irregular. The fact that she mentioned her period started that day and couldn't go out might be a valid reason. The author's comment about other women not acting like that could be seen as minimizing her experience, implying she's overreacting or not trying hard enough. \n\nEven if the author's intention was to express his frustration, the way he communicated it was problematic. Comparing her to others can make someone feel judged. The girlfriend locking herself in her room and being upset shows that his words hurt her deeply. \n\nSo, while the author might not have intended to be harsh, his words were hurtful and dismissive of her needs. He should have handled the situation with more empathy and understanding rather than making a comparative statement. The fact that he planned weeks in advance but she mentioned her period the same day might mean she couldn't have known earlier, so expecting her to plan around it every time isn't fair if her cycle is unpredictable. \n\nTherefore, the author's approach was flawed. He should have addressed his feelings without belittling her experience. The answer is likely A (he is in the wrong) because his comment was hurtful and lacked empathy, even if his intention wasn't malicious.\n"
