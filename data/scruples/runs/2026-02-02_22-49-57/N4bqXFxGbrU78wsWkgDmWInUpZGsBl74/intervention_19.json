We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting upset when his girlfriend cancels plans during her period. The key points here are about communication, expectations, and empathy in a relationship.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that the girlfriend cancels plans when she's on her period, which he finds frustrating, especially when she had prior knowledge of the plans. He planned a special date night weeks in advance, but she canceled it, leading to his comment about other women not acting this way. The girlfriend reacted extremely emotionally, calling him names and crying, and they haven't talked since.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he felt justified because he had prepared the date and the girlfriend had agreed to it. He thought other women he knew managed to go out despite their periods, so he felt she could have made an effort. But his delivery was passive-aggressive, and he compared her to other women, which is a classic relationship faux pas. Comparing partners can be hurtful and dismissive of their individual experiences.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction, while intense, might stem from feeling disrespected. When someone is in pain, especially during their period, they might feel invalidated if their partner implies they're not handling it correctly. The comment about other women could make her feel like her experience isn't valid, leading to defensiveness and emotional outburst.\n\nThe author's mistake was not only in making the comparison but also in not addressing the issue with empathy. Instead of expressing his disappointment constructively, he used a passive-aggressive tone, which escalated the situation. Even if his intentions were to encourage her to make an effort, the way he communicated it was flawed. Relationships require understanding each other's needs and limitations. The girlfriend might need rest and care during her period, and the author's frustration should be balanced with compassion rather than criticism.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, both parties have roles. The author could have discussed his feelings without comparing her to others, while the girlfriend could have communicated her needs more clearly or made alternative plans. However, the author's approach was problematic because it undermined her experience and triggered a negative reaction.\n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A) because his communication was hurtful and dismissive, even if his feelings of frustration are understandable.\n"
