We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by breaking down the situation. The author is upset with his girlfriend because she cancels plans when she's on her period. He planned a special date night, reserved dinner, got movie tickets, and even dressed up, but she decided to stay home instead. He told her that other women he's known don't act like this during their periods, implying she should try harder to go out despite it. Then she reacted really strongly, getting angry and crying, and they haven't talked directly since.\n\nFirst, I should consider the girlfriend's perspective. Menstrual cramps can be really painful for some women. It's not just a minor inconvenience; it can affect their ability to function normally. The author mentions that she \"curls up on the couch\" and that it's semi-random when her period starts. If she's in pain, she might not be able to go out regardless of how much \"effort\" she puts in. The author's comment about other women not acting this way could be seen as invalidating her experience. Even if others have different reactions, it doesn't mean she's wrong for feeling the way she does. Everyone's body and pain tolerance are different.\n\nThen there's the communication aspect. The author says he wasn't angry but maybe passive-aggressive. Passive-aggressive comments can be hurtful even if they're not outright confrontational. Telling someone they should act like others, especially when it's a sensitive topic like health, can come off as dismissive. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that his words hit a nerve. She might have felt judged or criticized, which is a common trigger for emotional outbursts in relationships.\n\nAlso, the fact that this has been an ongoing issue for the author\u2014she cancels plans for the first two days of her period\u2014means that he should have been aware of this pattern. Planning a date night during that time, even if he thought he was scheduling around it, might not have been possible. The key here is understanding that her condition is a valid reason to cancel, and the author's frustration might stem from not considering the physical and emotional toll her period has on her.\n\nAnother point is the use of a nickname for the period, like \"shark week,\" which could be trivializing her condition. While he acknowledges that women get cramps, the way he frames it might not fully capture how severe her symptoms are. The girlfriend's anger might be because she feels her pain isn't being taken seriously.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author's comment about other women not acting like her could be seen as belittling her experience. Even if he didn't mean to be harsh, the message was that her reaction is excessive and that she should try to push through, which is a form of invalidation. That's probably why she reacted so strongly. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because his approach was dismissive and didn't show empathy towards her situation.\n"
