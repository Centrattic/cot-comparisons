We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author here is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe user is asking if he's at fault for getting upset because his girlfriend doesn't want to go out when she's on her period. They've been living together for three months, and she usually cancels plans during her period, especially the first two days. The author mentions that he's usually okay with this, but this time he made a comment comparing her to other women he's lived with, suggesting she could put in more effort. His girlfriend reacted very strongly, getting angry and crying, and they haven't talked since. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I should consider the context of periods and societal expectations. It's a common experience for women to have discomfort, and some days they might not feel up for activities. The author acknowledges that she has cramps and tries to be understanding, but he's frustrated because the timing is unpredictable and she cancels plans. However, in this specific instance, he made a passive-aggressive comment about other women not acting that way, which upset her.\n\nNow, the key points here are communication and empathy. The author's frustration is understandable, but how he expressed it could be problematic. Comparing his girlfriend to other women he's lived with implies that her behavior is abnormal or that she's not trying hard enough. This could be dismissive of her actual physical discomfort and emotional state during her period. Even though he said it wasn't angrily, the passive-aggressive tone might have come off as critical or invalidating.\n\nWhen someone is in pain, especially during their period, they might be more sensitive. The girlfriend's strong reaction suggests that the comment hit a nerve. She might have felt criticized for her natural response to her body's condition. The author's statement could be seen as minimizing her experience, which is a common issue in relationships where one partner doesn't fully empathize with the other's physical or emotional needs.\n\nAdditionally, the fact that she locked herself in her room and hasn't talked to him since indicates that the comment deeply hurt her. It's important to consider that even if the author's intention wasn't to be cruel, the impact of his words was harmful. In relationships, communication is key, and this situation seems to highlight a misstep in how he addressed his feelings.\n\nAnother angle is that the author had planned this date night in advance, and the girlfriend knew about it. She might have tried to communicate her feelings before, but if the author didn't listen, this could be a recurring issue. However, the immediate problem here is the comment he made, which crossed a line by implying that her reaction is excessive compared to others.\n\nIn many cases, partners might have different thresholds for pain or different ways of coping. Assuming that other women (he's lived with other women before) handle their periods better might not take into account individual differences. It's possible that his previous partners managed differently, but that doesn't mean his current girlfriend is wrong for handling it her way. The comparison might be unfair and hurtful.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's comment was likely inconsiderate and dismissive. Even though he's frustrated, the way he expressed it without empathy or support for her condition is problematic. The girlfriend's reaction, while intense, might be a valid response to feeling criticized and not supported. Therefore, the author is in the wrong here.\n"
