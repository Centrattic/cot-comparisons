We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she cancels plans when she's on her period. The situation involves their relationship dynamics and the girlfriend's reactions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author mentions that his girlfriend cancels everything when she's on her period, especially the first two days. He's been patient, but this one time he had plans weeks in advance, and she canceled again. He made a comment about other women not acting that way, which upset her a lot. She had a strong emotional reaction, calling him names and crying.\n\nNow, thinking about the key points here: The author's main issue is that he felt his plans were disregarded, and his comment was about other women. The girlfriend's reaction was intense. But why? Maybe the comment made her feel criticized or compared negatively to others, which can be a big trigger. Even if he wasn't being aggressive, saying that others don't act like that could be hurtful. Periods can be really tough, and pain levels vary. What's normal for one person might not be for another. The author's frustration is understandable, but his approach might not have been the best.\n\nThe question is about whether he's in the wrong. The girlfriend's period is a health issue, and her needing rest or canceling plans is valid. However, the author's comment about other women could come across as dismissive of her experience. Even if he was trying to be passive-aggressive but not angry, the message was that her behavior is unreasonable compared to others. That might invalidate her feelings, making her feel unappreciated. \n\nAlso, the fact that her period is irregular might mean she can't plan around it, so expecting her to adjust might be unfair. The author had planned in advance, but if her cycle is unpredictable, maybe there's a need for more flexibility or understanding. His response was a comparison that led to her emotional breakdown. It's possible that he didn't consider how that comparison would affect her, even if he wasn't intending to be harsh.\n\nSo, considering all that, even though he had a valid frustration, his method of expressing it was problematic. He might be in the wrong because his comment was hurtful and didn't account for her feelings, leading to a significant conflict. The answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because his approach contributed to the argument and hurt her feelings, even if his intentions were to express frustration.\n"
