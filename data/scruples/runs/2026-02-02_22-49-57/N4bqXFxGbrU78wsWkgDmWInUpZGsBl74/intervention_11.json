We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a relationship where the girlfriend cancels plans when she's on her period, and the author got upset because he felt she wasn't making an effort. He compared her to other women he's lived with, which led to an argument.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider both sides. The author planned a special date night, which the girlfriend knew about weeks in advance. She started her period on that day and canceled. The author mentioned that he wasn't angry but maybe passive-aggressive when he said other women didn't act that way. The girlfriend had a strong reaction, leading to a breakdown in communication.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he might feel frustrated because he made an effort and expected reciprocation. But from the girlfriend's side, period pain can be severe, and she's dealing with physical discomfort. Comparing her to other women might feel like a personal attack, implying she's not trying hard enough. That could hurt her feelings, especially if she's already in pain and feeling vulnerable.\n\nThe key points here are communication and empathy. The author's comment about other women could come across as dismissive of her experience. Even if he meant it to encourage her, it might not have been the right approach. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that the comment was a trigger, leading to a major conflict.\n\nI think the author did make a mistake in how he communicated his feelings. Instead of comparing her to others, he could have expressed his disappointment and discussed ways to handle future plans. Comparing her to other women might invalidate her feelings and make her feel undervalued. So, the author is in the wrong because his approach wasn't considerate of her situation and triggered a strong negative reaction.\n"
