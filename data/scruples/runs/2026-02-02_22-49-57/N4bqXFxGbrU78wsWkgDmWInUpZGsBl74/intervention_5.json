We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend when she cancels plans during her period. The key points here are the comparison to other women he's lived with and the resulting argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is on her period and experiences cramps, which is a known issue. The author had planned a special date night weeks in advance, but she canceled because she was unwell. The author's frustration comes from the fact that he felt she wasn't making an effort, especially since he mentions other women didn't act like this. \n\nNow, the main issue here is the comparison. Even if the author is frustrated, bringing up other women is likely to be seen as dismissive of his girlfriend's current experience. It's important to acknowledge that everyone's pain tolerance and experiences with periods can vary. What works for one person might not work for another. By comparing her behavior to other women, the author is implying that she's not handling her period correctly, which can be hurtful.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was severe\u2014she was upset, angry, and cried. The fact that she's usually sweet and kind suggests that the author's comment was a real trigger. The way he phrased his criticism, even if not angry, was passive-aggressive and made her feel judged. The comparison to other women he's known probably made her feel like her needs and feelings weren't valid, especially during a time when she's already uncomfortable.\n\nEven though the author had planned the date and was disappointed, the way he expressed his frustration was problematic. He didn't validate her feelings or acknowledge her pain, which is essential when someone is unwell. Instead, he focused on his own expectations, which is where the conflict arises. \n\nSo, while the author's disappointment is understandable, the method he used to express it and the comparison to other women were the main issues. His approach didn't consider her perspective and likely made her feel unappreciated and invalidated. Therefore, the author is in the wrong here because he didn't handle the situation with empathy and understanding, leading to a hurtful argument.\n"
