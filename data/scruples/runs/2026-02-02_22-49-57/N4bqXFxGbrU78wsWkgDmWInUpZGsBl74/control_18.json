We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA question is in the wrong. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the guy is upset because his girlfriend cancels plans when she's on her period. He planned a special date night, but she called it off because she was on her period. He told her that other women he's known don't act that way and implied she could put in more effort. She got extremely upset, yelled at him, cried, and they haven't talked since.\n\nHmm. The key points here are communication and respect. The author's main issue is that he's frustrated by her canceling plans during her period. He's had this issue before and usually puts up with it, but this time he snapped. He made a comment comparing her to other women, which is a classic \"othering\" move\u2014saying others don't act this way. That can come off as dismissive of her experience.\n\nFrom the girl's perspective, she's dealing with physical discomfort. Periods can be really painful for some people. The fact that she cancels plans might be her way of managing pain. The author's comment about other women could be perceived as invalidating her feelings. Even if he wasn't angry, the passive-aggressive remark might have been hurtful because it suggests she's not trying hard enough. That's not supportive. \n\nAlso, the author planned the date knowing her cycle is unpredictable. Maybe he should have been more flexible or communicated better. Instead of making a passive-aggressive comment, he could have expressed his feelings without comparing her to others. \n\nThe girl's reaction was intense, but it's possible she felt her needs weren't being respected. The author's statement could have made her feel like her pain isn't valid. In a relationship, supporting each other through health issues is important. Dismissing her experience, even if in frustration, isn't the right approach. \n\nSo, the author's mistake was not respecting her experience and using a comparison that might minimize her pain. He should have found a way to express his feelings without being dismissive. Therefore, he's in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
