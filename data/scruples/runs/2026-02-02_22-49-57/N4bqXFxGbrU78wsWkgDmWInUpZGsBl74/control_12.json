We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the girlfriend not wanting to go out when she's on her period, and the author getting upset because of that. He planned a special date, but she canceled it because of her period. Then he made a comment comparing her to other women he's lived with, which made her really upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that his girlfriend is usually great, but during her period, she's not up for anything. He's been putting up with it until this one time. He had plans that she canceled, and he made a passive-aggressive comment. The key here is his comment about other women not acting that way. That seems like a comparison that could be hurtful. Comparing his girlfriend to others, even if not directly, might make her feel inadequate or not considered. \n\nHe knew about the date in advance, so maybe he should have anticipated her period cycle? But he says it's semi-random. However, if she's been having periods at irregular times, maybe they could have discussed a backup plan? But he didn't plan that, so he's partly responsible for the expectation. \n\nThe main issue is his reaction. Even if he wasn't angry, the passive-aggressive comment about other women is a problem. It's dismissive of her feelings and pain. Periods can be really uncomfortable, and expecting someone to push through might not be realistic. His comment implies she's not trying hard enough, which could be very hurtful. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was intense, but that doesn't mean he's in the right. The way he communicated his feelings was probably not constructive. He should have approached it with more empathy. Even if he felt slighted, criticizing her in that way is a common way to escalate conflicts. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author made a mistake in how he expressed his frustration. The girlfriend's needs and discomfort are valid, and his comment was likely invalidating. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
