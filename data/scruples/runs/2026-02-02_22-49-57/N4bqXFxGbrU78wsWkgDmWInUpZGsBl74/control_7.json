We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the AITA post) is in the wrong. The situation is about the girlfriend not wanting to go out when she's on her period, and the author expressing frustration about it. \n\nFirst, the author mentions that the girlfriend only cancels plans for the first two days of her period, which she can't control. They had a planned date night that she canceled because her period started that day. The author tried to explain that other women he's known don't act like this, implying that maybe his girlfriend should make more effort. The girlfriend then got extremely upset, called him names, and they haven't talked since.\n\nSo, the key points here are about empathy and communication. The author is frustrated because his plans were canceled, but the girlfriend is dealing with a natural bodily function that causes her discomfort. It's not something she can control or plan around precisely. The author's comment about other women comparing her behavior might come off as dismissive of her feelings and pain. Even if he said it passively-aggressive, pointing out that others don't act that way could make her feel judged or invalidated.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to support each other through health issues. Period pain can be severe enough to affect daily activities. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from feeling unappreciated or misunderstood. The author's expectation that she should push through her discomfort for the plans might be unrealistic. The girlfriend's emotional outburst indicates that she felt hurt or criticized, which makes sense if she felt her needs weren't respected.\n\nSo, even though the author had planned the date, which is understandable, he might have mishandled the situation by not being more compassionate. The fact that the girlfriend locked herself in her room and they haven't talked since shows the impact of his words. The author should probably consider apologizing and finding a way to support her during her period instead of expecting her to meet social obligations when she's unwell.\n\nTherefore, the author is likely in the wrong here. The answer should be A.\n"
