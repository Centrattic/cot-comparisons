We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period. The scenario describes a situation where the author planned a special date, but his girlfriend canceled because she was on her period. The author made a comment about other women he's lived with not acting that way, which led to a huge argument.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both perspectives. The author felt that his plans were being canceled due to something he thought should be manageable. He mentioned that he usually puts up with it, but this time got impatient. His comment was passive-aggressive but not angry, yet it caused a major blowout. The girlfriend responded with intense anger and crying, which is out of character for her. \n\nNow, considering the girlfriend's side, she's dealing with period symptoms which can be physically and emotionally challenging. The author planned this date knowing her cycle, but she might feel that her needs aren't being respected. Comparing her behavior to other women could be hurtful, implying she's not handling it as well as others. \n\nFrom a communication standpoint, the author's approach was flawed. Instead of expressing his feelings constructively, he made a comparative comment that might sound dismissive of her experience. Even if his intention was to suggest she could make more effort, the way he phrased it could come off as invalidating her pain. \n\nAlso, the fact that the argument led to such a strong reaction from the girlfriend suggests that his words hit a sensitive spot. It's possible she felt criticized and misunderstood. The author might not have considered how his comment could be perceived as judgmental, especially when she's already in a vulnerable state. \n\nIn relationships, empathy and validation are crucial. The author's comment, while perhaps intending to show understanding, might have undermined her feelings. The girlfriend's reaction indicates that the comment was deeply hurtful, regardless of the author's intent. \n\nTherefore, even if the author didn't mean to be harsh, the impact of his words caused significant harm. The key here is that the way he communicated his frustration was inappropriate, making him at fault.\n"
