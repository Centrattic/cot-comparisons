We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is upset with his girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period. They've been living together for three months, and she's usually laid back, but during her period, she cancels plans and stays home. The author usually puts up with it, but there was a specific date night he planned weeks ahead. She got her period that day and canceled the plans. He told her, in a non-angry but maybe passive-aggressive way, that other women he's lived with don't act like this, so he thought she could put in more effort. She lost it, called him names, cried, and they haven't talked since. He's wondering if he's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. So, the main issue here is the author's comment about other women. Let's break this down. The girlfriend is experiencing a period, which can be physically uncomfortable. It's a common experience for many women, but the severity varies. The author is frustrated because she cancels plans, but he had a specific plan he put a lot of effort into. However, he compares her to other women he's known, implying that she's not making enough effort. \n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, when one partner is unwell or in pain, the other partner might expect understanding and support. The author, instead of expressing empathy, used a comparison to other women, which could come off as dismissive of her needs and feelings. Even if he wasn't angry, the passive-aggressive comment might have invalidated her experience. \n\nSaying that other women don't act this way could be seen as belittling her situation. It's possible she felt judged or accused of not being a \"good\" partner by not pushing through her discomfort. The fact that she reacted so strongly suggests that his comment hit a nerve, maybe touching on deeper insecurities or past experiences. \n\nThe author might not have intended to be cruel, but his approach was hurtful. The key here is how his words made her feel. Even if his intention was to express his disappointment, the method was not constructive. In relationships, communication style matters a lot. Instead of comparing her to others, he could have discussed his feelings and maybe found a compromise, like a different activity they could do together at home if she's too unwell.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's comment was inappropriate. He assumed that other women's behavior is the standard she should meet, which isn't fair. Each person's experience with menstruation is different, and it's important to respect her needs rather than hold her to a comparison. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for making that comment.\n"
