We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is at fault here. The situation is about a girlfriend who cancels plans when she's on her period, and the author expressed frustration by comparing her to other women he's lived with who don't act that way. The girlfriend reacted extremely angrily, leading to a breakdown in communication.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is described as great, funny, and laid back, so this might be a rare point of conflict. The author mentions she knows about the plans in advance and still cancels. But periods can be unpredictable, and some people experience severe pain or discomfort. Even if the author knows she usually cancels the first two days, maybe the expectation was for her to make an exception for a special date night. \n\nThe key issue is the author's comment. He said he knows other women who don't act this way and implied she should make more effort. That's pretty judgmental. Comparing a partner to others is a classic no-no in relationships. Even if the author's intention was to express frustration, the way he did it was dismissive and passive-aggressive, which could be hurtful. The girlfriend's strong reaction suggests that the comment crossed a line. She might feel invalidated, as if her experience during her period isn't legitimate. \n\nAlso, the author might not be considering the physical and emotional impact of her period. Severe cramps can be debilitating. Expecting her to go out despite that could be unrealistic. But instead of accommodating her, he criticized her, which probably made her feel unappreciated and attacked. \n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author's words likely contributed to the argument. Passive-aggressive comments, even if not yelled, can be harmful because they undermine the other person's feelings. The girlfriend's anger and crying indicate deep hurt. The author should have approached the situation with more empathy and support, perhaps by asking how he could help rather than making a comparison. \n\nSo, the answer is probably A, because the author's approach was disrespectful and didn't account for her well-being, even if he was frustrated. However, the girlfriend's over-the-top reaction might also be part of the problem, but the initial provocation was the author's comment. The main question is about who is in the wrong, and the author's choice of words seems to be the trigger here.\n"
