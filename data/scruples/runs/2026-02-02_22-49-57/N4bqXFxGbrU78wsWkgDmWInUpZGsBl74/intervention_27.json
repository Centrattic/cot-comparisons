We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend over her not wanting to go out when she's on her period. \n\nFirst, the context: The couple has been living together for three months. The girlfriend is usually laid back but has a pattern of canceling plans when she's on her period, especially the first two days. The author usually tolerates this but got upset when she canceled a planned special date night. He made the plans weeks in advance and she knew about them. He mentioned to her that other women he's known don't act this way, suggesting she could make more effort. She reacted extremely negatively, calling him names and crying.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The author's frustration is understandable\u2014he invested time and effort into planning a special night, which was canceled. However, the way he expressed his feelings might have been insensitive. Comparing her to other women he's known could come off as dismissive of her pain and needs. Even if he wasn't angry, the passive-aggressive comment might have minimized her experience with period cramps, which can be severe for some.\n\nIt's important to note that PMS and menstrual cramps can vary greatly; what's manageable for one person might be debilitating for another. The girlfriend's reaction was extreme, but her emotional response might be tied to feeling judged or not supported. The author's comment could have made her feel like her health wasn't valid, leading to her anger and tears.\n\nIn a healthy relationship, communication and empathy are key. The author's approach might have lacked empathy, focusing on his own disappointment rather than her physical discomfort. Even if his intention wasn't to be cruel, the message he conveyed could have been hurtful. He might need to acknowledge her pain and find ways to support her, rather than comparing her to others.\n\nSo, while the author might have felt justified, the method he used to express his feelings was problematic. The answer is likely A (he's in the wrong) because his comment was dismissive of her experience, leading to a conflict.\n"
