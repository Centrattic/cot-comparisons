We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a couple where the girlfriend cancels plans when she's on her period, especially for a pre-planned date night. The author got upset and made a comment comparing her to other women he's known, which caused a big argument.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The girlfriend does experience severe period symptoms, staying home and canceling plans. The author planned ahead, knew about her period, but got frustrated. His comment was passive-aggressive about other women not acting this way.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author's reaction was justified. Even if he's frustrated, bringing up other women and implying she's not trying hard enough could be hurtful. It's a comparison that might make her feel criticized, especially when she's already in pain. The girlfriend's strong reaction suggests that the comment was deeply offensive to her, leading to a breakdown in communication.\n\nThe author might think he's just being honest, but the way he expressed his feelings could come off as dismissive of her needs. In relationships, communication is key, and making such a comparison can be seen as invalidating her experience. Even if the author's intention wasn't to hurt, his words did cause harm. So, he's in the wrong for not considering her feelings and using a comparison that's unkind and unhelpful.\n\nTherefore, the answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
