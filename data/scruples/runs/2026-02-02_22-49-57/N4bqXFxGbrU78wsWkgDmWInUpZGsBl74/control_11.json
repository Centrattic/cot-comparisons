We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend over her period. He planned a date night, she canceled because she was on her period, and he commented that other women don't act like that. She got really upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentions that his girlfriend usually cancels plans when she's on her period, and he's been putting up with it. But this time, he got impatient. He made plans in advance, and she had known about them. She canceled last minute because her period started that day. \n\nWhat he said was that other women he's lived with didn't act that way, implying she should try harder. That's where the conflict probably started. Comparing her to other women can be hurtful. Even if he wasn't angry, saying that others don't act like this can sound dismissive of her feelings and physical state. \n\nWomen often experience severe cramps, pain, and other symptoms during their period. It's not just a matter of effort. The author might not fully understand the severity of her symptoms. By bringing up other women, he's invalidating her experience. \n\nCommunication is key here. Instead of making a passive-aggressive comment, maybe he should have asked how she was feeling or offered to reschedule. The fact that she got so upset and cried shows how much his words hurt her. \n\nEven if the author had a valid frustration about plans being canceled, the way he expressed it was inconsiderate. He didn't acknowledge her pain or suggest alternative solutions. Comparing her to others is a common mistake in relationships and often leads to conflict because it makes the other person feel unappreciated or misunderstood.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to validate each other's experiences. The author's comment didn't do that. He should have been more empathetic. So, yes, he's in the wrong. The answer is A.\n"
