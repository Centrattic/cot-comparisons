We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy is upset because his girlfriend cancels plans when she's on her period. He planned a special date night, but she ended up staying home because her period started. He told her that other women he's known don't act like that, implying she could put in more effort, and she got really angry.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's argument is that he's been patient, knows periods are tough, but this time he felt let down. He mentions that she had known about the plans in advance, so maybe he felt she wasn't trying. On the other hand, the girlfriend's reaction was intense\u2014calling him names, crying, locking herself in her room. That's a big reaction. \n\nNow, the key points here are communication and empathy. The author might not have realized how hurtful his comment was. Comparing his current girlfriend to past experiences can come off as dismissive. Even if he didn't mean it angrily, saying other women don't act like that can invalidate her feelings. It's possible that his comment made her feel unsupported or criticized during a time when she's already feeling vulnerable. \n\nThe girlfriend's strong reaction suggests that the author's words hit a nerve. Maybe she felt judged or that her pain wasn't being acknowledged. Even if he thought she could push through, it's important to recognize that everyone's experience with periods is different. What works for others might not work for everyone. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author tried to express his feelings, but the way he did it might have been insensitive. He could have approached it by acknowledging her discomfort and discussing how to handle such situations in the future, rather than comparing her to others. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's approach might have been a mistake. He may not be entirely in the wrong because he was expressing his feelings, but the method and the comparison likely made it hurtful. Therefore, the answer might be A, he's in the wrong, because his comment was dismissive and caused a big upset. But maybe B if you think he had a right to express his feelings. Hmm. Wait, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Even if he's frustrated, the way he communicated it was probably the issue. So leaning towards A.\n"
