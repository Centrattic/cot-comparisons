We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author getting upset because his girlfriend cancels plans when she's on her period. He planned a special date night, but she canceled because her period started that day. He made a comment comparing her to other women he's lived with who didn't act like that, which led to her getting really upset and crying.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that he had put effort into planning, knew about her period in advance, but she still canceled. He felt justified in his comment, thinking maybe she could put in more effort. The girlfriend's reaction was intense, which suggests that his comment was hurtful or offensive to her.\n\nFrom a general standpoint, periods can cause physical discomfort, and some women might feel too unwell to go out. However, it's also true that some people manage to function normally during that time. The key issue here is the comparison he made. By saying that other women he's known didn't act that way, he's implying that she's not making enough effort, which can come off as dismissive of her experience. Even if he didn't say it angrily, the passive-aggressive tone might have been the last straw.\n\nCommunication is crucial in relationships. The author could have approached the situation differently, like expressing his disappointment without making a comparison. Instead, he made a generalization that might have invalidated her feelings. The girlfriend's reaction indicates that she felt criticized and judged, which is a common emotional response to such comments.\n\nSo, while the author might not have intended to be hurtful, the way he expressed his feelings did lead to a significant conflict. The comparison to other women is problematic because it can make the girlfriend feel like her needs or experiences are less valid. It's possible the author didn't realize how his words could be perceived. In relationships, it's important to validate each other's experiences, especially regarding health and well-being. Therefore, the author's comment, even if not overtly angry, was likely the catalyst for the argument, making him at least partially at fault.\n"
