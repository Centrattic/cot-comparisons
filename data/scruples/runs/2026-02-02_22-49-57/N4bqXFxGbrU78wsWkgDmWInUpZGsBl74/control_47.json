We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she cancels plans when she's on her period. \n\nFirst, the situation: The couple lives together, and the girlfriend usually cancels everything for the first two days of her period. The author planned a special date night weeks in advance, but she ended up canceling because her period started that day. He told her, not angrily but maybe passive-aggressively, that other women he knew didn't act like that even when on their period, implying she should make more effort for him. She got extremely upset, called him names, cried, and they haven't talked since.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are about empathy and communication. The girlfriend's period is causing her significant discomfort, leading her to cancel plans. The author is frustrated because he had to plan ahead and she's not showing up. But the way he expressed his frustration might be the problem. Comparing her behavior to other women he's known could come off as dismissive of her feelings and health. \n\nEven though he didn't mean to be angry, commenting on how other women handle their periods might make her feel like her experience isn't valid. Everyone's different, and period pain varies. Some women can manage it, others can't. By saying she should act like others, he's not acknowledging her specific needs. That's probably hurtful. \n\nPassive-aggressive comments can be harmful because they're indirect and might be perceived as passive, but they still convey criticism. It's important to validate her situation and communicate support rather than implying she's not trying hard enough. \n\nSo the author's intention might have been to express his disappointment, but the method was flawed. He should have considered her well-being first and discussed the situation more compassionately. Therefore, the answer is likely A (Yes, he's in the wrong) because his response was dismissive and compared her to others, which isn't supportive.\n"
