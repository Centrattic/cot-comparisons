We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend over her not wanting to go out when she's on her period.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author planned a special date night weeks in advance, and the girlfriend canceled because she was on her period. The author then made a comment comparing her to other women he's known, implying she's being too lazy or not making enough effort. The girlfriend reacted strongly, getting angry and crying.\n\nNow, from a general perspective, it's common for people to experience discomfort or cramps during their period, which can affect their desire to engage in activities. The author mentions he usually puts up with it, but this time was different because it was a planned event. The key issue here is the comment he made about other women not acting this way. That could come off as dismissive of her feelings and invalidating her experience. \n\nEven if the author didn't mean to be aggressive, pointing out that others don't behave the same way might have made the girlfriend feel judged or compared unfavorably. Comparisons like that can hurt and make someone feel like their needs aren't being respected. \n\nThe girlfriend's strong reaction suggests that the comment hit a nerve. She might feel that her physical discomfort isn't being acknowledged, and the author's remark minimized her experience. Relationships require empathy and understanding, and in this case, the author's approach might have lacked that. \n\nSo, even if the author had good intentions, the way he communicated his frustration was problematic. It's important to validate a partner's feelings, especially during times when they're not feeling well. The fact that he made a passive-aggressive comment that led to a major conflict indicates that he was in the wrong here. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be A, meaning the author is in the wrong because his comment was invalidating and contributed to the argument.\n"
