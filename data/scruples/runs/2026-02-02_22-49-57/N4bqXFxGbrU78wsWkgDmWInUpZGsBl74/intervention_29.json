We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's dive into this situation. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she cancels plans when she's on her period. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points from the scenario. The girlfriend is described as great, but she consistently cancels plans during her period's first two days. The author usually puts up with this, understanding that periods can be tough. However, there was a specific instance where he had planned a special date night weeks in advance, and she canceled due to her period. The author then made a comment that other women he's lived with don't act this way, even when on their periods, implying that she could put in more effort. This led to a huge argument and emotional fallout.\n\nNow, the author is questioning whether he was wrong. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong, but wants my opinion. The answer should be A (Yes, in the wrong) or B (No). \n\nLet me break it down. The main issue here is communication and empathy. The author had made plans knowing her period might come at any time, but chose to push ahead regardless. When she canceled, he reacted by comparing her to other women, which can be a hurtful comment. Even if it wasn't said angrily, the implication that she's not handling her period as well as others is likely to be taken as dismissive of her pain and feelings. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction\u2014blowing up and crying\u2014suggests that the comment hit a nerve. Periods can be a sensitive topic, and comparing her to others might invalidate her experiences. Even if the author intended to express frustration, the way he did it was probably not constructive. \n\nAlso, the fact that the period timing is \"semi-random\" each month means that planning around it might be challenging, but the author still chose to make a big event. The girlfriend might feel that her needs are not being considered, especially if this has been a recurring issue. The author's expectation that she should make an effort despite her discomfort might not take into account her actual physical and emotional state during that time.\n\nIn relationships, empathy and understanding are crucial. The author's comment, while perhaps not intending to be harsh, could be seen as not respecting her boundaries and health. The girlfriend's strong reaction indicates that she felt disrespected or criticized, which is a valid response to being compared to others in a way that undermines her feelings.\n\nTherefore, the author's comment likely crossed a line, even if it was passive-aggressive and not shouted. Comparing her to other women and suggesting she's not trying hard enough can be considered dismissive and inconsiderate. The author may not have intended to be cruel, but the impact of his words was significant. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he made a hurtful comparison and didn't show sufficient empathy towards his girlfriend's situation, leading to a significant conflict."
