We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author and his girlfriend have been living together for three months, and he describes her as great, funny, and laid back. The main issue is that during her period, especially the first two days, she doesn't want to do anything and cancels all plans. He mentions that he usually puts up with it, understanding that women get cramps. But one time, he got impatient when he had a special date night planned weeks in advance. She knew about it, but she started her period that day and wanted to stay home. The author then told her, not angrily but maybe passively aggressively, that he knows other women who don't act like this, even during their periods, and that she could put in more effort for him. She reacted extremely negatively, calling him names, crying, and locking herself in her room. They haven't spoken directly since.\n\nThe user says they think the author isn't in the wrong but wants to know my opinion. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, let's consider the author's actions. He made a plan and she knew about it, but her period started. He's been patient before, but this time he expressed frustration. The key point here is his statement about other women not acting like this. Even if he said it passively, that's a comparison that can be hurtful. He's implying that her reaction is abnormal or excessive, which might not be fair. Period symptoms can vary a lot between individuals, and just because other women he's known didn't cancel doesn't mean his girlfriend is wrong. Comparing experiences can be dismissive of her pain.\n\nAlso, making a big deal out of a pre-planned date that she can't attend because of her period could be seen as not being considerate. He planned something special, which is great, but maybe he didn't consider that she might be in a lot of pain. Even if he's not angry, bringing up other women's experiences might make her feel invalidated. Her reaction was extreme, but it's possible he triggered her by not being empathetic enough.\n\nOn the other hand, he did plan ahead and she was aware. He did say he was upset but not angry. However, the way he expressed his feelings by comparing her to others is problematic. It's important to validate her experience rather than dismissing it with comparisons. So, while the girlfriend overreacted, the author's statement was likely hurtful and inconsiderate. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (yes, the author is in the wrong) because his comment invalidated her experience and needs. Even if he intended to be passive-aggressive, it crossed a line by implying her behavior is abnormal and expecting her to push through pain without support.\n"
