We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's girlfriend cancels plans when she's on her period, and the author got upset because he felt she wasn't making an effort. He told her that other women he's known don't act that way, and she got really angry.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. They've been living together for three months, and the girlfriend is described as generally nice and laid-back. The main issue is the period-related cancellations. The author tried to set up a special date night, but she canceled because of her period. He mentioned other women didn't behave this way, which upset her.\n\nFrom a general perspective, PMS and menstrual cramps can cause physical discomfort and mood changes. It's important to be empathetic and understanding. The author's comment about other women could be seen as dismissive of her feelings and invalidating her experience. Even if it wasn't said angrily, it might have come off as passive-aggressive and hurtful. Comparing her to others he's known might make her feel like she's not being supported, especially if she's in pain.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was intense, but it's possible she felt disrespected. The author might not realize how his words affected her. Communication is key here. He could have approached the situation differently, maybe expressing his feelings without comparing her to others. The key point is whether his comment was disrespectful or not. Since he used a past experience to imply she should handle it better, that's a problem. People have different ways of dealing with pain, so it's not fair to judge her based on others. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong because his comment was insensitive and dismissive of her feelings. The answer should be A.\n"
