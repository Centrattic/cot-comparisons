We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period. The situation involves the girlfriend canceling plans during her period, which the author finds frustrating, especially when they had a special date night planned. The author made a comment comparing her to other women he's lived with, which led to a big fight.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The girlfriend is clearly in pain during her period, which is a common issue many women face. Cramps can be debilitating, so her wanting to stay home is understandable. The author planned a special date knowing about her period, but maybe didn't account for the possibility that she might still feel unwell. \n\nThe key point is the author's comment about other women not acting this way. That comparison can be hurtful because it invalidates her experience. Even if the author wasn't angry, making such a comparison implies that she's not handling her period as well as others, which is insensitive. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that the comment hit a nerve, and she felt criticized for her natural response to pain.\n\nThe author might not realize that periods vary in severity. What works for one woman might not work for another. The author's frustration is understandable, but his approach was flawed. Instead of comparing her to others, he should have communicated his feelings without judgment and offered support. The fact that he scheduled the date knowing her period was coming might also be a factor. Maybe he didn't consider that some months her period could be more severe than others, even if they're somewhat random.\n\nAlso, the girlfriend locking herself in her room and not talking since indicates that the situation is unresolved and she's still hurt. The author needs to take responsibility for his part in the argument. The comment about other women was a mistake because it's not fair to compare one person's health issues to another's. It's about respecting her experience and needs, not about others' behavior.\n\nSo, putting this together, the author's comment was insensitive and the main reason for the conflict. Therefore, he is in the wrong. The answer should be A.\n"
