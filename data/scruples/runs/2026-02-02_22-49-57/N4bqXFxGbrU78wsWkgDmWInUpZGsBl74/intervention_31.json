We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend who cancels plans during her period, and the author expressed some frustration by comparing her to other women he's known.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's perspective is that he planned a special date night, which he had arranged weeks in advance. He's upset because his girlfriend canceled last minute, even though she knew about the plans. He mentions that she usually cancels during her period and that her cycle is irregular, making it hard for him to adjust. He did express his feelings, maybe a bit passive-aggressively, by saying he knows other women who don't cancel, implying she should try harder. The girlfriend reacted strongly, calling him names and crying, leading to a rift in their communication.\n\nNow, the girlfriend's side: periods can be physically and emotionally challenging. Cramps, fatigue, mood swings are common. She might be in real pain and needs rest. If her period started that day and she was unable to go out, maybe she felt invalidated by his comment. Comparing her to other women could feel dismissive and hurtful, even if not said angrily. The fact that she locked herself in her room and hasn't talked since suggests deep emotional impact.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, from a relationship dynamics standpoint, communication is key. Even if the girlfriend is canceling due to her period, the author's approach could be seen as blaming her for natural bodily functions. It's possible he didn't consider her feelings and instead made a passive-aggressive remark, which might not be the best way to address his frustration. The girlfriend's reaction might be a result of feeling unappreciated or criticized during a time when she's already uncomfortable. \n\nOn the other hand, the author did plan something special and was looking forward to it. He might have felt his efforts were disregarded. But the key point here is how he expressed his feelings. Instead of supporting her and maybe being flexible, he compared her to others, which could come off as dismissive. In relationships, it's important to validate each other's experiences. Saying other women don't act this way might minimize her real discomfort and make her feel like she's being judged.\n\nSo, even if the author's intention was to express his feelings without anger, the way he did it was probably hurtful. The girlfriend's reaction, while intense, is a sign that she felt deeply wronged. The author didn't account for her perspective and needs, leading to conflict. Therefore, he's likely in the wrong for not being considerate enough in his communication and for making a comparison that undermined her experience.\n"
