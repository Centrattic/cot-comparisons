We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girlfriend who doesn't want to go out when she's on her period, and the author got upset after she canceled their special date night. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author planned something special, and the girlfriend had her period, which she wasn't going to do anything about. The author made a comment comparing her to other women he's lived with, implying she could put in more effort. The girlfriend reacted strongly, getting angry and crying.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's comment about other women, the girlfriend's reaction, and the context of her period. \n\nMenstrual cycles can cause significant physical discomfort, and each person's experience varies. The author acknowledges that women get cramps but seems frustrated by the girlfriend's behavior. However, he compared her to others, which might have been hurtful. The girlfriend's strong reaction suggests that his comment was offensive to her.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, even if he's not angry, making a passive-aggressive remark about other women implies that his girlfriend is not meeting his expectations. It's possible he dismissed her feelings or the severity of her symptoms. Even if she's usually laid back, this specific situation led to a conflict. \n\nThe author might not be in the wrong if his intention was to express his feelings calmly, but the way he phrased it could be seen as invalidating her experience. It's important to consider communication styles and empathy in relationships. By bringing up other women, he might have made her feel inadequate or judged.\n\nIn relationships, it's crucial to validate each other's feelings. The author's comment, even if not angry, could have been a trigger. The girlfriend's reaction is a sign that his words hurt her deeply. So, maybe he is in the wrong because he didn't consider how his words would affect her, even if his intention was to ask for more effort. \n\nAlso, the fact that they haven't talked since shows the impact of his words. He needs to take responsibility for his part in the conflict. So, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
