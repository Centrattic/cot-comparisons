We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the girlfriend not wanting to go out when she's on her period, and the author expressing that he finds her behavior different from other women he's known.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author plans a special date night, but the girlfriend cancels because she's on her period. He then comments that other women don't act like that, implying she should try harder. She reacts extremely negatively, calling him names and crying.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether the author's comment was wrong. Even though he wasn't angry, saying that other women don't act like this and suggesting she should put in more effort could be seen as dismissive of her feelings. Periods can cause significant discomfort, and expecting someone to push through that might not be reasonable. Comparing her to other women is also a classic relationship no-no because it invalidates her experience.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction, while intense, might be a result of feeling criticized during a time when she's already vulnerable. The author didn't consider how his words might hurt her, even if his intention was to express disappointment. Communication is key here, and perhaps he should have approached it differently, like expressing his feelings without comparing her to others.\n\nIn relationships, empathy is crucial. The author might not have considered how his statement could make her feel unappreciated or judged. Even if he's frustrated, the way he communicated it was probably hurtful. So, he's likely in the wrong because he didn't validate her feelings and made a comparison that could be seen as disrespectful.\n"
