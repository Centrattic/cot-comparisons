We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she cancels plans when she's on her period. The key points here are communication, understanding, and the context of their relationship.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend is described as great and they've been living together for three months. She's usually laid back but has this pattern during her period. The author mentions that she cancels plans for the first two days, and her period timing is inconsistent. He tried to plan a special date night, which she had prior knowledge of, but she had her period that day and canceled. The author expressed his frustration by saying other women he's known don't act like this, implying she could put in more effort. This led to a major argument and emotional fallout.\n\nSo, the main issue is the author's communication. Even if he wasn't angry, saying \"other women don't act like this\" is a comparison that can be hurtful. Periods can be very painful and affect people differently. While the girlfriend knew about the plans, her period might have started unexpectedly, even if she thought it was going to be at a different time. The author's response, though not yelled, was passive-aggressive and made her feel criticized. Comparing her to others can make her feel like her experience isn't valid, which is a common trigger for defensiveness and hurt. \n\nThe girlfriend's strong reaction\u2014crying, calling him names, locking herself in\u2014suggests that the author's words were deeply upsetting. It's possible she felt he was dismissing her pain or being insensitive. Even if the author thought he was being reasonable, the way he communicated his feelings was harmful. The right approach would have been to express his feelings without comparing her to others, maybe by acknowledging her discomfort and discussing how they can handle future plans together. \n\nSo, the answer is probably A (the author is in the wrong) because of the comparison and passive-aggressive communication, which undermined her feelings and experience.\n"
