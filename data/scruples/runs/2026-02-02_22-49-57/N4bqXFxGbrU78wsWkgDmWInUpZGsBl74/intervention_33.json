We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about a girlfriend not wanting to go out when she's on her period, and the author got upset, leading to a big argument.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The girlfriend's behavior: she cancels plans when she has her period, which happens at irregular times. The author planned a special date night, but she canceled it. He told her he's seen other women not act like this, implying she should try harder. She reacted extremely, calling him names, crying, and they haven't talked since.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the author's approach. He's upset about the canceled plans but expressed it in a way that's passive-aggressive. Comparing her to other women is a sensitive point. That's a common mistake in relationships because it can come off as disrespectful or dismissive of her feelings.\n\nEven if the author was frustrated, the way he communicated his feelings matters. Telling her that others don't act like this during their periods might invalidate her experience. Periods can be very painful for some people, and expecting them to go out despite the discomfort is unfair. The author should consider that her needs are valid and that communication is key instead of comparing her to others.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was intense, but it's possible she felt disrespected. The author's comment might have made her feel attacked, especially if she's already dealing with pain and discomfort. The fact that they haven't talked since suggests a lack of resolution, which is a problem.\n\nSo, even if the author's intention was to express disappointment, the method was hurtful. The wrong lies in how he expressed his feelings rather than the feeling itself. He should have approached the conversation with empathy and understanding, maybe discussing how to adjust plans or support each other instead of making a comparison.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong because his comment was disrespectful and invalidated her experience, leading to the conflict.\n"
