We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend about her not wanting to go out when she's on her period. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author's girlfriend cancels plans when she's on her period, especially the first two days. He's put up with it before, but this time he planned a special date night and she canceled. He told her that other women he's known don't act this way, implying she could make more effort. She got extremely upset, called him names, cried, and they haven't talked since. The question is whether he's at fault.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's frustration with the girlfriend's behavior during her period, the specific incident with the planned date, and his comment comparing her to other women. The girlfriend's reaction was intense, and now he's wondering if he was wrong.\n\nFrom a general perspective, it's known that periods can cause physical discomfort and sometimes emotional changes. It's important to be understanding and supportive. The author mentions that he usually puts up with it, so he's aware of the cramps. However, in this case, he expressed his frustration by comparing her to other women. That comparison is likely hurtful because it implies she's not meeting his expectations and that she's not trying hard enough. \n\nEven if he wasn't angry, saying that other women don't act this way can come off as dismissive of her feelings and experiences. It's not just about the period itself but also about validating her feelings. The girlfriend might feel that he's not respecting her needs and is instead holding her to a standard based on others. \n\nCommunication is crucial in relationships. The author might have a valid feeling about the canceled plans, but the way he communicated it was problematic. Using comparisons to other women can be a trigger, as it can make someone feel like they're being judged or not good enough. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that this comment was a significant breach in their communication, leading to a major conflict.\n\nAlso, the author planned the date knowing about her period. Wait, he says she started her period that day, but he had known about the date for weeks. However, if her period is irregular, maybe he couldn't have known in advance. The girlfriend might have tried to inform him, but he might not have expected it that week. But the key issue is his response when she canceled.\n\nIn relationships, when one partner is in pain or has a valid reason to cancel plans, the other is expected to be supportive. However, the author's comment about other women not acting this way undermines her experience. It's not about whether she's \"right\" or \"wrong\" in her symptoms but how he reacted. His response wasn't supportive; instead, it was a criticism that led to a major blowout.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the author's action was to voice his frustration in a way that was not supportive and instead judgmental. Therefore, he is likely in the wrong here. The answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
