We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about a couple where the girlfriend cancels plans when she's on her period, and the guy got upset because he had a planned date night. The key points here are about communication, expectations, and sensitivity.\n\nFirst, the guy planned a special date knowing about her period. Wait, the article says he reserved dinner and got movie tickets weeks in advance, and she knew about the plans. But on the day of the date, she started her period and canceled. The guy then made a comment comparing her to other women he's lived with who didn't act this way, implying she could put in more effort. The girlfriend reacted strongly, leading to a big fight.\n\nSo, the guy's actions: He had knowledge of the plans and her period schedule? Wait, the user mentioned that he can't schedule around her periods because they come at a \"semi-random time every month.\" But in this specific case, he planned the date weeks in advance. If he knew her cycle was irregular, why plan something during that time? Maybe he didn't check or considered it possible, but still, if she started on that day, maybe it was a coincidence. However, he had prior experience with her canceling when on her period, so perhaps he should have been more cautious about scheduling during that time.\n\nThen, when she canceled, he made a passive-aggressive comment comparing her to other women. That's probably where things went wrong. Even if he was upset, bringing up other women and implying she's not trying hard enough is likely hurtful and invalidating. Women's experiences with periods vary, and expecting her to push through pain to go on a date might be unreasonable. His comment could be seen as dismissive of her needs and feelings.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was intense, but her response might be due to feeling criticized and not supported. The guy's approach might have made her feel like her pain wasn't valid. So, the main issue here is his communication and the comparison to other women, which can be a sensitive topic in relationships.\n\nConsidering all that, even if he was upset about the canceled plans, the way he expressed his frustration was inconsiderate. He should have communicated his feelings without belittling her experience. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong for how he handled the situation.\n"
