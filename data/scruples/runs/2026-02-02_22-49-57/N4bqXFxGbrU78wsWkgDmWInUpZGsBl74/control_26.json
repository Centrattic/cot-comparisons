We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend about her not wanting to go out during her period. \n\nFirst, the situation: The girlfriend doesn't want to do anything for the first two days of her period, cancels plans, and the author is frustrated. He plans a special date night, but she backs out because her period started that day. He comments that other women he's lived with don't act like this, leading her to have a strong negative reaction.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author's actions: He expressed frustration that his girlfriend isn't putting in effort during her period. He compared her to other women he's known, implying she's not trying hard enough. His girlfriend felt criticized and was upset.\n\nNow, considering the girlfriend's perspective. She's dealing with physical discomfort, which can be significant. Her actions are a response to her body's needs. The author planned a date knowing about her period, but maybe didn't account for the randomness of her cycle as she mentioned. The author's comment about other women might come off as dismissive of her experience, which could be hurtful.\n\nCommunication is a big factor here. The author might not have considered how his words would affect her. Even if he's not angry, saying others handle it better could imply she's not handling it properly. The girlfriend's reaction shows that the comment was deeply upsetting to her. \n\nRelationship dynamics also matter. Both need to be considerate of each other's needs. While the author might feel his efforts were unappreciated, the way he communicated his feelings could have been more empathetic. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's comment likely hurt her feelings and dismissed her valid physical experience. Even if his intention wasn't to be cruel, the impact was negative. The girlfriend's reaction, while intense, is a sign of how much the comment affected her. \n\nTherefore, the author is probably in the wrong because his comment was insensitive and didn't take into account her physical state and feelings. He didn't approach the situation with empathy, leading to a conflict.\n"
