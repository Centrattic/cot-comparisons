We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the guy planned a special date for his girlfriend, who ended up being on her period that day and canceled. He got a bit passive-aggressive, comparing her to other women he's lived with who don't act like that even when on their period. She flipped out, called him names, cried, and they haven't talked since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's point is that he planned something in advance, and she knew about it. She canceled because of her period. He says he's usually okay with her staying in during those days, but this time he felt it was unfair, especially since he had put effort into planning. Then he made a passive-aggressive comment about other women not acting like that. She took it really badly.\n\nFrom the girlfriend's perspective, maybe she felt disrespected or criticized. Even if the author didn't mean to be angry, comparing her to other women could be hurtful. Menstruation is a natural biological process, and it's not uncommon for women to feel unwell during it. The author's comment might have implied that her reaction was excessive or that she's not putting in enough effort, which could feel like a judgment. \n\nThe key points here are communication and empathy. The author expressed his feelings, but perhaps in a way that wasn't validating of her experience. Even if he was upset about the plans, bringing up other women could make her feel like her pain isn't being taken seriously. It's possible that the author didn't consider how his words might affect her, especially during a time when she's already vulnerable. \n\nAlso, the fact that she locked herself in her room and hasn't talked to him since suggests that the comment hit a nerve. It's important to recognize that everyone's experience with their period is different, and what might seem like a small inconvenience to one person can be debilitating for another. The author might have dismissed her feelings by comparing her to others, which isn't fair. \n\nSo, even if the author had valid feelings about the canceled plans, the way he expressed them was harmful. The right approach would be to validate her feelings, maybe offer to reschedule, and communicate more effectively rather than making comparative statements. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because his comment was disrespectful and hurtful, even if he didn't mean it aggressively.\n"
