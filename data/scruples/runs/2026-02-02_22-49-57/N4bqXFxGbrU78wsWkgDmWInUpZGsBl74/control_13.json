We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author getting upset with his girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period. He planned a special date night, but she canceled due to her period. He told her that other women he's lived with didn't act that way, which made her angry. Now he's wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author's point is that he had a planned date, and he felt let down because she canceled. He didn't lash out but was passive-aggressive. However, his girlfriend got extremely upset, called him names, and locked herself in her room. The key issue here is his comment about other women not acting that way. \n\nFrom the girlfriend's perspective, being on your period can be physically uncomfortable. She might be in pain and not in the mood to go out. The author's comment implies that her reaction is excessive compared to other women, which could be hurtful. Even if he meant it as a light comment, it might have made her feel judged or invalidated. \n\nThe author had known about her period issues beforehand and usually puts up with it, but this time he got impatient. Planning a date in advance but not considering that her period might interfere could be a problem. Maybe he should have been more flexible or communicated better. Also, using other women as a benchmark is not fair because everyone experiences periods differently. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was intense, but it's possible she felt disrespected by his comment. The author might not have realized how his words affected her. The fact that she rarely cries and locked herself in shows how upset she was. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author could have expressed his feelings without comparing her to others. Instead, he made a judgment that might have invalidated her experience. Even if he wasn't angry, the passive-aggressive comment might have been the trigger. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author's comment was probably the main issue here. He should have been more understanding and not compared her to others. His intention was to encourage her to make an effort, but the method was hurtful. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
