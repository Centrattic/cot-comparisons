We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but they want my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the scenario. The author's girlfriend cancels plans when she's on her period, which happens semi-randomly. The author planned a special date night, but the girlfriend canceled when her period started. The author made a passive-aggressive comment comparing her to other women he's lived with, which made her extremely upset. \n\nSo, the key points here are: the author was upset about plans being canceled, made a comparison to other women, and that led to a big argument. The question is whether the author was wrong to do that.\n\nI should consider both sides. On one hand, the author had put effort into planning the date and was disappointed. On the other hand, the girlfriend was dealing with period cramps, which can be really painful and affect energy levels. The author's comment about other women not acting like this could come off as dismissive of her pain and invalidating her experience. Even if it wasn't angry, passive-aggressive remarks can still be hurtful. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was intense\u2014calling the author names, crying, and locking herself in her room. That suggests she felt hurt or criticized, which the author's comment might have caused. Comparing her to other women can be a sensitive topic because it implies she's not measuring up. Even if the author meant to encourage her, the way it was phrased might have been the problem. \n\nSo, while the author's intention was to express frustration about the canceled plans, the method of doing so was probably not constructive. It's important to validate a partner's feelings and health issues rather than make comparisons. The author might not have intended to hurt, but the statement could have been seen as dismissive of her needs. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not handling the situation with more empathy and understanding.\n"
