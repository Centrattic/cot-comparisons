We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a couple where the girlfriend cancels plans when she's on her period, and the author got upset because he felt she wasn't making an effort.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is described as usually being great and laid back. The issue is her behavior during her period. The author mentions that she cancels plans for the first two days, even if they were planned in advance. He tried to be understanding but this time got frustrated because he had planned a special date weeks in advance, and she canceled last minute. His comment was passive-aggressive, comparing her to other women he's lived with, implying she should try harder. The girlfriend reacted extremely, which surprised him.\n\nThe key points here are communication and empathy. The author's comment, even if not shouted, was critical and made a comparison to others. That's a sensitive topic. Period-related discomfort can be severe, and dismissing someone's needs can be hurtful. The girlfriend's reaction, while intense, might be a result of feeling criticized and unsupported during a time she's already struggling. \n\nEven if the author had good intentions, the way he expressed his frustration was dismissive of her experience. It's important to validate her feelings instead of making her feel like she's overreacting. The fact that the girlfriend locked herself in her room and they haven't talked since shows the impact of his words.\n\nSo, while the author might feel justified, the way he approached the situation was probably inconsiderate. He didn't address his feelings constructively, leading to a conflict. Therefore, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
