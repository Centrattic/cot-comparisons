We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author mentions that his girlfriend cancels plans during her period, which happens at irregular times. He planned a special date night, but she canceled because she was on her period. He compared her behavior to other women he's lived with, suggesting she could put in more effort. This led to an argument and her emotional outburst.\n\nNow, the key points here are about expectations and communication. The girlfriend's experience with her period is causing her discomfort, leading her to cancel plans. The author, on the other hand, had made plans in advance and felt let down. He expressed his frustration by comparing her to other women, which might come off as dismissive of her feelings and health. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to validate each other's experiences. The author's comment about other women not acting this way could imply that his girlfriend is being overly sensitive or that her behavior is abnormal, which is not helpful. Menstrual cramps can be painful and affect people differently; some might need to rest, while others can still go out. The author should have tried to understand her situation rather than making a comparison.\n\nAdditionally, the girlfriend's reaction\u2014being upset, crying, and locking herself in\u2014indicates that the author's words hurt her. Communication is two-way, and it's possible the author didn't consider how his words would affect her. Even if he wasn't angry, the passive-aggressive remark might have been a trigger for her.\n\nSo, while the author might feel his frustration is understandable, the way he expressed it and the comparison to other women likely contributed to the conflict. The responsibility here is on the author to adjust his expectations and communicate more empathetically, rather than dismissing her needs. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because he didn't validate her feelings and made a judgmental comment, leading to her emotional response.\n"
