We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong after getting upset with his girlfriend for canceling plans during her period. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author planned a special date night weeks in advance, and his girlfriend canceled it because she started her period. He expressed his frustration by saying he's seen other women manage without canceling, which led to a big fight.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was intense\u2014she got angry, cried, and hasn't spoken to him since. The key points here are communication and respect. Even if the author was frustrated, bringing up other women in a passive-aggressive way might have been hurtful. Periods are a sensitive topic, and comparing one's partner to others can come off as dismissive of her feelings and pain. \n\nThe author might not have realized how his words affected her. The fact that she locked herself in her room and is upset shows that his comment was a significant trigger. While he might not have intended to be cruel, the way he expressed his frustration was likely the root of the problem. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to validate each other's feelings. Even if someone is going through something, communicating in a way that doesn't invalidate their experience is crucial. The author's comment about other women could have made her feel unappreciated or judged. \n\nSo, considering all that, even if the author was upset about the canceled plans, his approach was inappropriate. He should have discussed his feelings without comparing her to others. Therefore, he's probably in the wrong here.\n"
