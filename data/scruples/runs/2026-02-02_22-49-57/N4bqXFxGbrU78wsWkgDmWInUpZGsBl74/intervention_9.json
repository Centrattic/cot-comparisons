We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author is upset with his girlfriend because she cancels plans when she's on her period. He had a planned date night, which she canceled because her period started. He mentioned that he told her, in a passive-aggressive way, that other women he's lived with don't act like this even during their periods. Then she got really angry and cried.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author says that she usually cancels plans during her period, and he's been putting up with it. But this time, he got impatient. He planned something special in advance, and she canceled. He expressed his frustration by comparing her to other women, which seems like a sensitive topic. Comparing partners to others is often a bad move in relationships because it can come off as disrespectful or dismissive.\n\nEven though the author tried to be passive-aggressive and not angry, bringing up other women implies that his girlfriend isn't meeting his expectations. Menstrual symptoms can vary, and some women might manage to go out despite cramps, but others might have more severe pain. It's possible that the girlfriend has a legitimate medical issue, or she might be more sensitive during that time. The author's comment about other women could be invalidating her experience, suggesting that she's not trying hard enough, which is hurtful.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was extreme, but her response might be due to feeling criticized or judged. The author's approach likely made her feel that her needs weren't respected. Even if he's frustrated, he should have communicated his feelings without comparing her to others. It's important in relationships to validate each other's experiences and find solutions together rather than assigning blame. The author's mistake was not just in his words but in how he handled the situation overall. Instead of planning something that might be difficult for her, he could have checked in with her or been more flexible. So, considering all that, the author is probably in the wrong because his comment was hurtful and invalidating.\n"
