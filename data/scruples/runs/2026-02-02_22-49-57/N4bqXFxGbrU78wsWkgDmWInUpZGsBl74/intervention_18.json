We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that he's upset with his girlfriend because she cancels their plans when she's on her period. He had a special date night planned, but she canceled because she was on her period. He made a comment comparing her to other women he's lived with, implying she's not trying hard enough. She got really upset and they haven't talked since. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author argues that he's not wrong because he's planning and she's canceling last minute, making it hard to schedule. But periods can be unpredictable, which he acknowledges, but he still planned a week in advance. She knew about the plans, but her period started that day. \n\nNow, his comment about other women not acting that way might be the key issue. Even if he's not angry, making a passive-aggressive remark comparing her to others could come off as dismissive of her pain. Cramps can be severe for some people, and suggesting others don't act that way might invalidate her experience. \n\nHe might not realize that his words were hurtful. Comparing her to other women could make her feel like her feelings aren't valid. Even if he thought she could put in more effort, the way he phrased it likely triggered her because it's a sensitive topic. \n\nOn the other hand, he was trying to communicate his feelings about the canceled plans. But instead of expressing his disappointment directly, he made a comparison which could be seen as critical. The right approach might have been to acknowledge her discomfort and adjust plans together, rather than implying she's not doing enough.\n\nSo, even if he didn't mean to be harsh, his words led to a major argument. It's possible he didn't consider how hurtful that comparison would be. Therefore, he's probably in the wrong because his communication was hurtful and invalidating, even if his intention was to express frustration.\n"
