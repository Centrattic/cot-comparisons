We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves the author getting upset with his girlfriend because she cancels plans when she's on her period. He planned a special date night, she had her period, canceled, and he made a comment comparing her to other women he's known. She got really angry and they haven't talked since.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend has periods that make her stay home for the first two days, which is causing issues. The author mentions that he's usually understanding but got frustrated this time. The main conflict is his comment about other women not acting like that, which upset her.\n\nI should consider the dynamics here. Periods can be physically and emotionally challenging. Cramps, fatigue, mood swings are common. The author acknowledges that women get cramps during their period but then questions his girlfriend's effort. His comment about other women implies that she's not trying hard enough, which could be disrespectful. Comparing her to others might invalidate her feelings and experiences.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was intense\u2014crying, anger, locking herself in her room. That suggests the comment hit a nerve. Maybe she felt criticized for her legitimate needs. Even if the author was frustrated, making a comparative remark about other women can come off as dismissive. It's important to validate her feelings rather than judge them.\n\nAlso, the author planned the date with advance notice, which the girlfriend knew about. However, her period started that day, which she might not have known earlier. The unpredictability of her cycle adds to the challenge. The author's frustration is understandable, but the way he expressed it was hurtful.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Instead of passive-aggressively bringing up other women, maybe discussing his feelings of disappointment in a supportive way would have been better. The girlfriend might feel pressure to perform despite her discomfort, which isn't fair either. Both need to find a balance where her needs are respected, and his feelings are communicated without criticism.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author's comment was hurtful and dismissive of her experience, leading to her emotional breakdown. Even though he wasn't angry, the passive-aggressive approach and comparison were wrong. The answer is A\u2014author is in the wrong.\n"
