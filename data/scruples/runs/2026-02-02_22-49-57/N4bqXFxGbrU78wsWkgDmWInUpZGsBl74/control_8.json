We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she cancels plans when she's on her period. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend cancels plans during her period, which the author finds frustrating. He had a planned date night that she canceled, and he made a comment suggesting other women he's known don't act that way. She got really upset and they haven't talked since.\n\nSo, the main points here are about communication and empathy. The author is frustrated with the unpredictability and the canceled plans. But the way he expressed his frustration might have been hurtful. Comparing his current girlfriend to others could be seen as dismissive of her feelings and health. Even if he wasn't angry, the passive-aggressive comment about other women not acting like that might have come off as invalidating her experience. \n\nPeriods can be really painful for some people, and it's a personal and sensitive issue. The author's comment might have made her feel like her pain isn't real or that she's being judged. The fact that she had a severe reaction suggests that the comment hit a nerve. Even if the author's intention was to express his frustration, the way he did it was probably not the right approach. \n\nAlso, the author should consider that each woman's experience with periods is different. Just because other women he's known didn't cancel plans doesn't mean that his current girlfriend is wrong for doing so. Everyone has different pain thresholds and coping mechanisms. \n\nSo, the key here is about respecting her needs and communicating better. The author should probably apologize and try to find a middle ground, maybe by discussing how they can handle future periods without causing conflict. His comment was probably inconsiderate, even if he didn't mean to be cruel. Therefore, he is likely in the wrong.\n"
