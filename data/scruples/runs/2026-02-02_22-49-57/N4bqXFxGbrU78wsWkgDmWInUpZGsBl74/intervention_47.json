We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the author getting upset because his girlfriend cancels plans when she's on her period. He planned a special date night, but she canceled it due to her period. He made a comment comparing her to other women he's known, implying she should put in more effort. She reacted very angrily, calling him names and crying.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The author acknowledges that the girlfriend is great and usually laid-back, but he's frustrated with her behavior during her period. He's trying to understand if his reaction was justified. The key points here are communication, empathy, and expectations in a relationship.\n\nThe author's comment about other women not acting this way might come off as dismissive of her experience. Even if he meant it passively, it's a comparison that can be hurtful. People's experiences with periods vary, and what might be manageable for one person isn't for another. His comment could be seen as invalidating her pain or discomfort, which is a sensitive topic.\n\nThe girlfriend's strong reaction suggests that his words hit a nerve. Comparing her to others in a situation where she's already vulnerable (dealing with period cramps) can feel critical and unsupportive. Even if he didn't mean to be harsh, the message might have been that her needs aren't as important as his plans. In a relationship, supporting each other during tough times is crucial. The author planned the date with good intentions, but he should have considered her well-being and maybe been more flexible or communicative about adjusting plans if needed.\n\nAlso, the author's approach of making a passive-aggressive comment instead of discussing his feelings directly might not have been the best way to address his concerns. Open communication is key in such situations. Instead of comparing her to others, he could have expressed his disappointment while still acknowledging her discomfort.\n\nSo, while the author might have had good intentions, his words and the way he conveyed his feelings could be seen as dismissive and hurtful. The girlfriend's reaction, though intense, might be a result of feeling criticized during a time when she needs support. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not being empathetic enough and for making a comparison that belittled her experience.\n"
