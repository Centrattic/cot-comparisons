We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period. \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation from both perspectives. The author planned a special date night, knowing her period might come. He's frustrated because she cancels plans and seems to not make an effort. He compares her to other women he's lived with, implying she's different. His comment about other women not acting that way probably hurt her feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend has her period, which is a time when many women experience cramps, fatigue, and discomfort. The author acknowledges that she's usually laid back and kind, but this time, his remark led to a big argument. She felt criticized, which is why she reacted so strongly. \n\nThe key points here are communication and empathy. The author's intention wasn't to be cruel, but his words came off as judgmental. Comparing her to others he's known could make her feel like she's not being considered as an individual. Even if he's frustrated, how he expressed his feelings was hurtful. \n\nThe author might not be in the wrong in the sense that he's human and can feel upset when plans are canceled, but the way he handled it was inappropriate. He didn't consider her feelings and used a passive-aggressive comment that crossed a line. The girlfriend's reaction shows that his words were deeply hurtful, which suggests that he did something wrong, even if unintentionally.\n\nSo, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because his comment was insensitive and contributed to the conflict, even if he didn't mean to be hurtful.\n"
