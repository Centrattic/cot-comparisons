We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The question is presented as an AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario. The author got upset with his girlfriend because she cancels plans when she's on her period. They had a special date night planned, but she ended up staying home due to her period. He made a comment comparing her to other women who don't act this way, which led to a big argument.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points are: the girlfriend cancels plans during her period, the author feels frustrated because he had planned something special, and he made a passive-aggressive comment that upset her. The author is questioning if he was wrong.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author's frustration is understandable because he put in effort to plan a date, and it was canceled. However, the way he expressed his feelings might have been hurtful. Comparing her to other women could make her feel disrespected or criticized, especially during a time when she's already feeling unwell. Even if he wasn't angry, passive-aggressive comments can still be damaging. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was intense, but that doesn't necessarily mean the author is in the right. His comment might have invalidated her feelings and experiences. It's possible he didn't consider how his words would affect her. The fact that his past partners didn't act the same way doesn't justify his response. Every person's experience with their period is different, and it's important to respect individual differences.\n\nSo, while the author's frustration is valid, his approach to expressing it was inappropriate. He should have communicated his feelings without comparing her to others. Therefore, he might be in the wrong because his comment was hurtful and dismissive of her needs.\n"
