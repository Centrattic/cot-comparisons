We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong (AITA) after getting upset with his girlfriend for canceling plans during her period.\n\nFirst, the author's main point is that his girlfriend cancels all plans when she's on her period, especially the first two days. He mentions that she's usually good, but this period issue is a problem. He planned a special date night, but she called it off because she started her period that day. He expressed his frustration by comparing her to other women he's lived with, implying she should make more effort. This led to a big argument and her emotional response.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. Periods can be physically and emotionally challenging for many women. Cramps, fatigue, mood swings are common. The author acknowledges that girls get cramps during \"shark week\" (probably a typo for \"that time of the month\"), but then seems to hold it against her when she cancels plans. \n\nThe key issue is communication and empathy. The author planned something with advance notice, and the girlfriend canceled because she was unwell. However, the way the author expressed his frustration was to compare her to other women, which can feel dismissive and invalidating. Saying that others don't act like this implies that her needs aren't valid, which can be hurtful. \n\nEven if the author wasn't angry, using passive-aggressive comments about other women's behavior during their periods is likely to come off as critical and unsupportive. The girlfriend's strong reaction (crying, anger) suggests that his comment hit a nerve, possibly making her feel judged about her health and needs. \n\nThe author might not realize that his comparison undermines her experience. It's possible that his previous experiences with other women don't account for the variability in how different people experience their periods. Some women can manage daily activities, while others struggle more. The author's comment implies that she should be able to manage, which might not align with her reality.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author's comment was the trigger. Even if he had valid feelings about the canceled plans, the way he expressed them was hurtful. Healthy communication involves expressing one's feelings without putting down the other person. The girlfriend's reaction indicates that the author's approach was damaging, and he might need to take responsibility for his words and approach a more empathetic solution.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author's actions, while possibly stemming from frustration, were inconsiderate and dismissive of his girlfriend's health. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
