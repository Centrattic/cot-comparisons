We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person (AITA) is in the wrong for getting upset when his girlfriend cancels plans during her period. He had planned a special date, she called it off because she was on her period, and he expressed that other women he's known don't act this way. She got really angry and they haven't talked since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is described as usually laid back and kind, but during her period, she's not up for anything. The author mentions he usually tolerates it, but this time he got impatient because he had planned a special night. His comment about other women might have come off as dismissive or critical, even if he wasn't angry. \n\nThe key points here are communication and sensitivity. Even if the author felt justified, bringing up other women could be hurtful. Comparing partners to others is often a bad move because it can make someone feel undervalued or judged. The girlfriend's reaction was intense, which suggests that his comment hit a nerve. \n\nAlso, the author's approach was passive-aggressive, which isn't the best way to address concerns. Instead of expressing his feelings directly and respectfully, he made a generalization that might have made her feel like her pain wasn't being taken seriously. The fact that she's rarely this upset indicates that his comment crossed a line for her.\n\nSo, even if the author's intention was to express his frustration, the way he did it was problematic. The wrong isn't about whether he was upset, but how he communicated it. Therefore, the answer is likely A (he's in the wrong) because his comment was insensitive and contributed to the conflict.\n"
