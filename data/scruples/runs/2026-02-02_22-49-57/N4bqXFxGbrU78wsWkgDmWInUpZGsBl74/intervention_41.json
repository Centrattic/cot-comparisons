We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author getting upset with his girlfriend because she cancels plans when she's on her period. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The girlfriend is usually nice and laid-back, but during her period, she cancels everything and wants to stay home. The author planned a special date night, which she canceled because her period started that day. He expressed his frustration in a somewhat passive-aggressive way, mentioning that other women he's known don't act like this. This led her to have a huge emotional reaction, yelling at him and locking herself in her room.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author planned a date knowing she was on her period, but maybe not knowing exactly when it would start. He compares his current girlfriend to past experiences with other women, which could come off as dismissive of her current situation. \n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. From what I know about empathy and communication in relationships, it's important to validate your partner's feelings. Even if the author is frustrated, bringing up past relationships and implying other women handle periods better can be perceived as invalidating her experience. Menstrual cramps can be really painful and affect people differently. The author might not understand the severity of her discomfort, but making a comparison to other women isn't helpful. \n\nAlso, the way he expressed his frustration\u2014passive-aggressively\u2014might have been hurtful. Even if he wasn't angry, the comment about other women could trigger feelings of inadequacy or defensiveness. The girlfriend's reaction, while intense, might stem from feeling criticized and not supported during a time she needs understanding. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's approach was not supportive. He should have communicated his feelings without comparing her to others. Instead of getting frustrated, he could have asked her how she's feeling and if there's anything he could do to help. Comparing her to other women undermines her individual experience and shows a lack of empathy. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because he didn't validate her needs and used a comparison that hurt her feelings.\n"
