We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author explains that his girlfriend cancels plans during her period, which he finds frustrating. He had a special date planned, and she canceled because she was on her period. He told her that other women he's known don't act that way, which led to a big argument.\n\nFrom the girlfriend's perspective, she's dealing with physical discomfort. Periods can cause cramps, fatigue, and other symptoms. The author acknowledges that she's normally laid back and sweet, but this situation led to her being upset. Her reaction was intense\u2014crying, yelling, and locking herself in her room. That suggests she felt deeply hurt by his comment.\n\nThe key points here are about communication and expectations. The author might not realize how his comment came across. Comparing her to other women he's known could be perceived as invalidating her experience. Even if he didn't mean to be harsh, saying other women don't act this way implies she's not handling her period as well as others. That could make her feel criticized, especially when she's already in pain.\n\nThe author planned a special night with advance notice, and she knew about it. However, her period timing is unpredictable for her. She might have felt pressured to go despite her discomfort, which could add to her stress. The author's frustration is understandable, but his approach was confrontational. Using passive-aggressive remarks about other women might not be the best way to express his feelings.\n\nThe girlfriend's strong reaction indicates that the comment hit a nerve. It's possible she felt her needs weren't respected, or that he wasn't considering her health and wellbeing. The fact that they haven't talked directly since shows the communication breakdown. The author should reflect on whether his criticism was constructive or just judgmental.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to validate each other's experiences. Instead of comparing to others, maybe discussing alternatives for future plans would be better. The author could have expressed his disappointment without making her feel like she's doing something wrong. So, overall, the author's approach was problematic, making him at least partially in the wrong.\n"
