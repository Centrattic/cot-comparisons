We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is at fault. The scenario involves a guy who got upset with his girlfriend because she canceled their date night when she was on her period. He had planned it weeks in advance, but she called off the plans because she was feeling unwell. He told her, in a passive-aggressive way, that other women he's known don't act that way during their periods, and that she could have put in more effort for him. She then had a huge emotional reaction, got upset, and they haven't talked since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The boyfriend planned a special date night, but the girlfriend canceled because she was on her period. He expressed his frustration by comparing her to other women he's known, implying she's not making enough effort. The girlfriend's reaction was intense, with anger and crying.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author (the boyfriend) is in the wrong. Let me break it down. The girlfriend is physically unwell and chooses to stay home. The boyfriend is upset because his plans were canceled. His response was passive-aggressive and included a comparison to other women. Comparing one's partner to others is often a bad move, as it can be hurtful and imply that the partner is not meeting expectations. Even if he didn't mean to be disrespectful, the comparison might come off as dismissive of her feelings and needs.\n\nPMS or menstrual cramps can cause physical and emotional discomfort, and it's not uncommon for women to feel the need to rest. The boyfriend acknowledges that she has cramps, so he knows it's not just about being lazy. However, his frustration led him to express his feelings in a way that might have invalidated her experience. Even if he didn't raise his voice, the passive-aggressive comment about other women could have been perceived as blaming her for her condition.\n\nCommunication is key in relationships. Instead of making a comparison, he might have expressed his disappointment in a way that validates her feelings. For example, saying he's disappointed but still wants to spend time with her if she's up for it. The way he phrased it suggested that her behavior was unacceptable, which could make her feel unappreciated or judged during a time when she's already experiencing discomfort.\n\nAlso, the fact that she's been generally kind and the only issue is this period-related behavior might indicate that she's trying her best otherwise. His reaction seems out of proportion given that he's usually accommodating. The fact that he had planned it weeks in advance and she knew about it suggests she had the chance to adjust or make alternative plans, but she chose to cancel because she was unwell. It's not her fault for being sick, and expecting her to push through could be seen as unreasonable.\n\nMoreover, her intense reaction implies that his comment hit a nerve. She might have felt disrespected or that her health was being trivialized. The comparison to other women could have made her feel like she's not good enough or that he's comparing her to others in a way that undermines their relationship.\n\nIn conclusion, while the boyfriend can feel disappointed about the canceled plans, his method of expressing that disappointment was inappropriate. He should have approached the situation with empathy rather than making a judgmental comment. Therefore, he's likely at fault here.\n"
