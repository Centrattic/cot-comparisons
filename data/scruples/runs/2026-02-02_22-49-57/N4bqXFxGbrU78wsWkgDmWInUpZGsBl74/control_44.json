We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author's girlfriend doesn't want to go out when she's on her period. The author plans a special date night weeks in advance, but she cancels because of her period. He tells her that other women he's lived with don't act like that, implying she could make more effort. She gets extremely upset, yells at him, and they haven't talked since. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author says he's usually patient and knows it's a monthly issue. But this time, he got upset because he had a planned date and she canceled. He made a comment comparing her to other women he's known, which probably came off as dismissive or critical. \n\nWhen someone is in pain, especially menstrual cramps, it's common for them to need rest or avoid activities. The author's comment might have invalidated her feelings. Even if he's not angry, saying other women don't act this way can make her feel like her experience isn't valid. That's probably why she reacted so strongly. \n\nHe might not realize that his words hurt her. Comparing her to others is a classic mistake in relationships because it can make someone feel judged. Even if his intention was to express frustration, the way he communicated it was harmful. \n\nOn the other hand, he did plan this in advance and she knew about it. Maybe he felt let down, but expressing that in a way that minimizes her pain isn't helpful. The key issue here is communication and empathy. The author's approach was to compare and criticize, which isn't supportive. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because his comment was hurtful and dismissive of her needs, even if he wasn't angry. He should have approached the situation with more understanding and perhaps discussed his feelings without making comparisons.\n"
