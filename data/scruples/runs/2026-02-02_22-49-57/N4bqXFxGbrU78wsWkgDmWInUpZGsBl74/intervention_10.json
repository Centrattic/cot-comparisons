We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author getting upset with his girlfriend because she cancels their plans when she's on her period. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author planned a special date night, and the girlfriend canceled because she was on her period. The author then made a comment comparing her to other women who he's known who don't act this way, which led to her getting extremely upset.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he might feel that he made an effort to plan something special, and the cancellation was disappointing. However, he also acknowledges that periods can be hard and he usually puts up with it. The key here is that he did express his feelings in a passive-aggressive way, which might have come off as dismissive of her experience. Comparing her to other women could imply that her needs aren't valid, which is a common issue in relationships where one person feels their needs aren't being considered.\n\nOn the girlfriend's side, she's dealing with period cramps, which can be really painful. She canceled the plans, which is understandable. The author's comment about other women might have made her feel like her pain wasn't acknowledged or respected. His comment could be perceived as minimizing her experience, leading to her emotional outburst.\n\nI should also think about communication styles. Passive-aggressive comments often don't resolve issues and can create more tension. The author's approach might have been a poor way to express his feelings. Instead of comparing her to others, a better approach would be to discuss how both can feel heard and supported.\n\nAnother angle is the expectation around plans. The author planned something in advance, but maybe he should have checked in with her closer to the date to confirm if she was feeling up to it. It's possible he didn't account for how her period might affect her that specific week, even if he knew she sometimes cancels when on her period.\n\nHowever, it's also important to recognize that the girlfriend's reaction was extreme. She used harsh language and locked herself in her room. But her reaction might be a result of feeling criticized and undervalued, not just about the period but perhaps deeper issues about how her needs are prioritized in the relationship.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, while the author's comment was hurtful, the girlfriend's response was also intense. But the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Comparing her to others and implying she should try harder could be seen as invalidating her health and pain. Even if he wasn't angry, the passive-aggressive remark might have been a trigger.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's comment was likely inappropriate and contributed to the conflict. He should have handled it more empathetically. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
