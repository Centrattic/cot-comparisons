We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she cancels plans when she's on her period.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend has periods that cause her to cancel plans, especially for the first two days. The author usually puts up with it, but one time he planned a special date night that she canceled because her period started that day. He told her that other women he's known don't act this way and she should put in a bit more effort. This led to a huge argument and her becoming very upset.\n\nNow, the author is asking if he's in the wrong. The user thinks he isn't, but wants my opinion. I need to evaluate both sides.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he planned something special and felt let down. He might think that his girlfriend could manage her period better or make an effort to keep plans. However, period cramps can be severe and unpredictable. The girlfriend might have real physical discomfort that makes going out difficult. Comparing her to other women could be hurtful, even if not said angrily. The comment about \"other women\" might imply she's not trying hard enough, which could be seen as invalidating her experience.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was intense\u2014using strong language, crying, and locking herself in her room. That suggests the comment really hurt her. Even if the author wasn't angry, the passive-aggressive remark might have made her feel criticized or not supported. Menstrual pain is a real issue, and expecting someone to push through when they're in pain could be unreasonable. The author's frustration is valid, but the way he communicated it might have been dismissive of her needs.\n\nSo, while the author might feel justified in his frustration, the way he expressed it and the comparison to other women likely contributed to the conflict. The key is whether his comment was supportive or not. By pointing out differences from other women, he might have undermined her feelings instead of offering support. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not validating her experience and for making a comparison that could be seen as critical.\n"
