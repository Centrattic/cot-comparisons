We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the person got upset with their girlfriend because she cancels plans when she's on her period. He planned a special date night, but she called it off because her period started. He told her that other women he's known don't act like that, implying she could do more. She reacted extremely angrily.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is at fault. I need to evaluate both sides. First, the girlfriend's perspective: she's dealing with period cramps, which can be really painful. It's common for people to feel unwell and need rest during that time. Canceling plans isn't unusual, even if it's inconvenient. The author mentions she does this every month, but this time he got upset.\n\nThe author's point is that he was trying to be understanding but got frustrated. He planned something special, and she canceled. He made a comment about other women not acting that way. That comment might have come off as dismissive or invalidating. Even if he wasn't angry, the passive-aggressive remark about her comparing her to others could be hurtful. It's possible he undermined her pain, making her feel like her needs aren't valid.\n\nThe girlfriend's strong reaction suggests that the author's words were a significant trigger. She locked herself in her room and they haven't spoken since. Maybe the author didn't consider how his words would affect her. Even if he's not in the wrong, his approach was poor. Comparing her to others isn't helpful and can be damaging. The key here is about empathy and communication. The author might have a valid frustration, but his method of expressing it was inappropriate. So, in terms of being in the wrong, the answer might be A (Yes) because his comment likely hurt her and wasn't supportive. However, if the user's initial thought is that he's not in the wrong, maybe there's a nuance. But I think the main issue is his dismissive attitude towards her needs, even if unintentionally.\n"
