We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting upset with their girlfriend over her not wanting to go out when she's on her period.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend doesn't want to do anything for the first two days of her period, cancels plans, and the author is frustrated because he planned a special date. He mentioned that other women he's known don't act this way, which led to a big argument. The girlfriend was upset and cried, and they haven't talked directly since.\n\nThe key points here are about empathy and communication. The author's frustration is understandable, but the way he expressed it might be the issue. Saying that other women don't act this way could come off as dismissive of her pain and feelings. It's important to acknowledge that periods can be very painful and that everyone experiences them differently. The author might have thought he was being reasonable, but comparing her to other women can be hurtful and invalidating. \n\nAlso, the fact that the girlfriend was in such a bad state (crying, locked in her room) suggests that his comments really hurt her. Even if it wasn't said angrily, the passive-aggressive remark about other women might have triggered her. The author should have been more supportive and maybe discussed how they can handle such situations without making her feel judged. \n\nSo, considering all that, it seems like the author is in the wrong because his response was dismissive and didn't take into account her feelings and physical state. The answer is A.\n"
