We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend when she cancels plans during her period. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend cancels plans during her period, which the author finds frustrating, especially when he's put effort into a special date. He mentions other women he's lived with didn't act this way. She got extremely upset, leading to a breakdown in communication.\n\nThe key points here are about expectations and communication. The author planned a special date, which she knew about weeks in advance. She canceled because she was on her period. The author's comment that other women he's known didn't act this way might come off as dismissive of her experience. Even if he wasn't angry, saying that others don't act this way could be hurtful. \n\nWomen's experiences with periods vary. Some might have severe cramps or other symptoms that make going out difficult. The author's comparison to other women could imply that her pain isn't valid compared to others. This might make her feel unappreciated or misunderstood. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction\u2014losing her temper and crying\u2014suggests deep hurt. It's possible she felt criticized for her natural physical discomfort. The author might not have considered how his words could be perceived as blaming her for her body's natural cycle. \n\nOn the other hand, the author had put effort into planning, which he was disappointed about. But his approach was to compare her to others, which isn't constructive. A better approach might have been to express his disappointment and ask how she's feeling, rather than making a judgment.\n\nIn relationships, empathy and understanding are crucial. The author's statement, even if passive-aggressive, likely hurt her feelings because it undermined her experience. The girlfriend's valid reaction indicates she felt attacked. \n\nSo, the author probably is in the wrong for not showing empathy and for making a comparison that invalidated her feelings. The answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
