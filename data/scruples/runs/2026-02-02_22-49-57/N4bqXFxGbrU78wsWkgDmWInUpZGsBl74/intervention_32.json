We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend over her not wanting to go out when she's on her period.\n\nFirst, some context: The girlfriend doesn't want to do anything for the first two days of her period, even canceling plans. The author tried to plan a special date night, but she canceled because her period started that day. He made a comment comparing her to other women he's lived with, implying she should put in more effort. She had a huge emotional reaction, leading to a conflict.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics here. The author's frustration is understandable\u2014he planned something special, invested time and effort, and was let down. But the key point is how he communicated his feelings. He mentioned other women as a comparison, which can come off as dismissive or invalidating. Even if it's not said angrily, using \"I know other women don't act like this\" can imply that her experience isn't valid. That's a common issue in relationships where one partner's experiences are minimized.\n\nFrom the girlfriend's perspective, periods can be really tough with cramps, fatigue, etc. She's already in pain, and the author's comment might have made her feel like her needs aren't respected. The fact that she had such a strong reaction suggests that his words hurt her deeply. The author might have overlooked her physical and emotional state, which is a valid concern. \n\nAlso, communication style matters. Even if the author's intention was to express disappointment, the way he framed it could be seen as blaming her. Comparing her to others can lead to feeling judged. It's possible he didn't realize how sensitive this issue is for her. \n\nSo, while his frustration is relatable, the way he expressed it and the comparison might have been inappropriate. Relationships require empathy and understanding, especially around health issues like periods. The author might have failed to validate her experience, leading to the conflict. Therefore, he might be in the wrong, but it's a nuanced situation.\n"
