We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend cancels plans when she's on her period, which the author puts up with most of the time. However, there's this one instance where he planned a special date night, and she canceled again. He mentioned that other women he's lived with didn't act this way, so he expressed that she could put in a little more effort. She got extremely upset, leading to an argument.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author planned a special date, she had already known about it, but her period started that day. He made a passive-aggressive comment about other women, implying she's not trying hard enough. She took it really badly.\n\nNow, considering cultural and social norms, it's common for people on their period to feel unwell, with cramps, mood swings, etc. The author acknowledges that she has cramps and that other women experience this. However, his frustration led him to compare her to other women, which can come off as dismissive of her feelings. Even if he wasn't angry, the passive-aggressive comment might have been hurtful because it's a sensitive topic.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was intense\u2014calling him names, crying. That suggests she felt criticized or not supported. Comparing her to other women can make someone feel like their pain isn't valid. The author might not have realized that this comment could trigger such a strong reaction. Also, the fact that he planned the date knowing her period is irregular adds to the complexity. Maybe she wasn't sure when it would come, so he should have been more flexible.\n\nThe question is whether he's in the wrong. In relationships, communication is key. Making assumptions or comparisons about how someone else deals with their period can be invalidating. Even if his intention was to express his feelings, the way he did it might have been inappropriate. He should have approached it with more empathy, perhaps discussing his feelings without putting her down.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author is likely in the wrong for making a passive-aggressive comment that invalidated her feelings and experiences. He should have been more understanding and found another way to express his frustration without comparing her to others.\n"
