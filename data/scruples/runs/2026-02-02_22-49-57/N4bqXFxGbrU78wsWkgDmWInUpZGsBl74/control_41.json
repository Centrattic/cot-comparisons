We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the girlfriend not wanting to go out when she's on her period, and the author got upset because she canceled their planned date night. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the main points. The girl is on her period, which causes her discomfort. The author planned a date, but she canceled because she was in pain. He compared her to other women he's lived with who don't act this way, and that's what caused her to flip out.\n\nSo, the key issues here are empathy and communication. The author might not fully understand how painful periods can be for some women. Just because other women in his past didn't act this way doesn't mean his girlfriend is wrong. Everyone's body is different. He made a comment that could be seen as dismissive of her pain, which is a big no-no. \n\nAlso, he planned the date knowing her period was around the corner but she couldn't predict the exact day. Maybe he should have been more flexible or checked in with her closer to the date. However, she did know about the plans in advance. But when the period started that day, she had to cancel. That's understandable if she's in pain.\n\nThe problem was the way he expressed his frustration. Comparing her to other women and suggesting she could put in more effort sounds like minimizing her experience. That's probably why she reacted so strongly. She felt disrespected. \n\nSo, even if he was upset about the canceled plans, the way he communicated his feelings was hurtful. The author should have tried to be more supportive and maybe found an alternative way to spend time together if she was too unwell. The fact that she locked herself in her room and they haven't talked since shows how badly he hurt her.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong. He should have been more empathetic and not compared her to others. His approach was dismissive of her needs and feelings.\n"
