We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's dive into this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting upset when his girlfriend cancels their plans because she's on her period.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both perspectives. The author mentions that his girlfriend has periods that come at unpredictable times and she cancels plans during those days. He planned a special date night, which she canceled, and he expressed frustration by comparing her to other women he's known. This triggered her to have a strong emotional reaction.\n\nNow, the key points here are about communication and empathy. The author is frustrated because he invested time and effort into planning the date, expecting her to make an effort as well. However, comparing her to other women in a passive-aggressive way might have been hurtful. Even if he wasn't angry, the comment could be seen as dismissive of her feelings and pain. \n\nFrom the girlfriend's side, she's dealing with physical discomfort, which can be really tough. Her reaction seems to be a mix of pain, frustration, and feeling criticized. The author's approach might have invalidated her experience, leading to her emotional outburst.\n\nIn relationships, how we communicate is crucial. Even if the author felt slighted, the way he expressed his feelings was probably not constructive. It's important to validate a partner's feelings, especially during times when they're unwell. Instead of comparing her to others, he might have approached it with empathy, asking how he can support her during those days while also expressing his feelings about the canceled plans.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's comment about other women might have been the trigger. While he had a valid feeling of being let down, the method of expressing it was likely inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong because his approach lacked empathy and triggered a negative reaction.\n"
