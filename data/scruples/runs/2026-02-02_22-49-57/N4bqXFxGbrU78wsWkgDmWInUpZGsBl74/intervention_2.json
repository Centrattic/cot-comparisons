We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is in the wrong. The author's girlfriend cancels plans when she's on her period, and the author got upset when she canceled a special date night they had planned weeks in advance. The author compared his current girlfriend to others he's known, implying she's being more extreme than others.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author mentioned that his girlfriend is generally great, but she has this issue with her period where she cancels everything for the first two days. The author tried to be understanding but felt frustrated after planning a special night. He made a passive-aggressive comment suggesting his other exes didn't act this way, which led to a huge argument.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's frustration is understandable, but the way he expressed it might have been hurtful. Comparing one's partner to others can be a sensitive issue. Even if the author's intentions were to encourage her to put in more effort, the comparison might have come across as dismissive of her actual pain or discomfort. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that the comment was deeply hurtful and invalidating. \n\nAlso, periods can be very painful and affect people differently. The author might not realize that his girlfriend's reaction is more severe, but by comparing her to others, he's implying she should handle it better, which can be seen as minimizing her experience. The fact that they haven't talked since indicates a breakdown in communication. The author needs to take responsibility for his part in the argument, even if he was frustrated. \n\nSo, from a relationship standpoint, it's important to approach such issues with empathy. The author's comment, even if not meant to be harsh, was inappropriate. The girlfriend's reaction, while intense, is a valid response to feeling invalidated. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for making that comparison and not considering how it would affect his partner. The answer should be A, that the author is in the wrong.\n"
