We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the girlfriend not wanting to go out when she's on her period, and the author expressing frustration, which led to an argument.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that the girlfriend cancels plans when she's on her period, which happens semi-randomly. He usually puts up with it, but this time he planned a special date. He told her, in a passive-aggressive way, that other women he's lived with don't act like this, implying she could put in more effort. She got extremely upset, called him names, cried, and they haven't talked since.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author's frustration is valid because he had planned something special, but his approach was passive-aggressive and compared his girlfriend to others. Comparing partners to others is generally a bad move in relationships, as it can come off as disrespectful. Also, while period cramps can be debilitating, the author's comment suggests he's dismissing her discomfort by implying she's not trying hard enough. That could be seen as invalidating her feelings and physical state. \n\nHe had prior knowledge of her period issues, but chose to plan the date anyway. Maybe he should have been more flexible or communicated better. However, the way he expressed his frustration was probably the main issue here. Instead of being understanding, he made a comparison that hurt her feelings. \n\nSo, even though he had some valid feelings about his plans being canceled, the way he communicated them was hurtful. The girlfriend's reaction might be extreme, but the author's comment about other women likely triggered her. Therefore, the author is probably in the wrong for how he handled the situation, despite his frustration.\n"
