We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she cancels plans when she's on her period. The situation is that he planned a special date night, she had her period on that day, canceled, and he made a comment comparing her to other women he's known, which led to her flipping out.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author's point is that he planned something special and she canceled last minute, which frustrated him. He mentioned that others he's known don't act this way, implying she could do more. But the girlfriend's reaction was intense\u2014she was upset, called him names, cried, and they haven't talked since.\n\nFrom a general perspective on relationships, communication is key. The author might have felt let down, but his approach was passive-aggressive. Comparing her to other women could be hurtful because it invalidates her feelings and experiences. Even if he wasn't angry, the comment could come off as dismissive. Menstrual issues can be severe for some, and even if others handle it differently, it's not fair to judge. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that the comment hurt her deeply, making her feel criticized and unappreciated. In relationships, it's important to support each other and find ways to accommodate each other's needs, not through comparisons. The author's frustration is understandable, but the way he expressed it was likely inappropriate. So, the answer would be A, he's in the wrong.\n"
