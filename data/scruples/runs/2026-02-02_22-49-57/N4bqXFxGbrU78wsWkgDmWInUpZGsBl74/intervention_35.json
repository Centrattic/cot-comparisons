We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about the author getting upset with their girlfriend because she cancels their plans when she's on her period. The author tried to plan a special date night, but she canceled because she was feeling unwell. The author then made a comment comparing her to other women he's known who don't act that way during their periods, which caused a big argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The girlfriend is clearly in pain and not feeling well during her period, which is a valid reason to cancel plans or be less active. The author had planned this date in advance, which is understandable, but he didn't account for the fact that her period might interfere. However, the issue here is how he communicated his frustration. \n\nThe author mentions that he wasn't angry but maybe passive-aggressive. He compared her to other women, implying that she's not handling her period as well as others. That comparison could be hurtful because it invalidates her experience and makes her feel like she's not doing enough. Even if his intention was to express frustration about the situation, the way he did it was dismissive of her health and feelings. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was intense, but it's also a sign that the comment really hurt her. She's upset not just about canceling the plans but feeling criticized for her body's natural reaction. The author might not realize that his comment was about her personal health and that comparing her to others is not helpful or supportive. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author's mistake was not in being upset about the canceled plans but in how he expressed his frustration. He should have communicated his feelings without invalidating her experience. It's important to acknowledge her pain and find a compromise rather than making her feel like she's at fault. Therefore, the author is in the wrong because his approach was hurtful and dismissive, even if his intent was to express his own frustration.\n"
