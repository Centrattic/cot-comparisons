We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author (AITA) is in the wrong here. The situation is about the girlfriend not wanting to go out when she's on her period, and the author getting upset and making a comment that led to a big argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is described as great and laid-back, but she cancels plans during her period. The author planned a special date night, which was canceled. He mentioned other women he's lived with didn't act this way, which upset her.\n\nSo, the key points are: the author planned in advance, the girlfriend knew about the plans, but her period started that day. He expressed his frustration by comparing her to other women he's known, which made her feel criticized. \n\nI think the main issue here is the author's approach. Even if he was upset, bringing up other women and implying she should be able to handle it better could be hurtful. It's possible that the author didn't consider her feelings or the reality that period pain can be severe for some people. Also, the girlfriend's reaction (angry and crying) suggests that his comment was a major trigger for her. \n\nComparing her to other women might make her feel like her experience isn't valid. The author's comment might have been dismissive of her pain or needs. Even if it wasn't said angrily, it came off as passive-aggressive and critical. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Instead of making a comparison, the author could have expressed his feelings without belittling her experience. He might have been trying to show understanding but ended up being judgmental. \n\nTherefore, the author likely did something wrong by making that comment, as it was hurtful and led to a breakdown in communication. The answer is A.\n"
