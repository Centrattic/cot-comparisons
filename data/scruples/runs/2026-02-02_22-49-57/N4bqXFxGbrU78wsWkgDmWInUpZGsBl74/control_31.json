We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The girlfriend has periods that come at unpredictable times, and during the first two days, she doesn't want to do anything, canceling plans. The author has usually put up with it, but this time, he made a special date night, which she canceled because her period started that day. The author commented that he knows other women who don't act this way, implying his girlfriend should try harder. She reacted very angrily, and now they haven't talked since.\n\nSo, the main issue is the author's response. Even though he wasn't angry, his passive-aggressive comment about other women not acting this way could be seen as dismissive of her pain. Periods can be very uncomfortable, and everyone experiences them differently. By comparing her to other women, he's potentially invalidating her feelings and symptoms. That's a common issue in relationships where one partner's health or well-being is minimized.\n\nAlso, he planned a special night knowing she had her period, but if she's been canceling plans during her period, maybe he should have considered that. Maybe he should have planned something more flexible or checked in with her closer to the date. However, the key point is his comment about other women, which is a classic \"why can't you be like others\" problem. That's usually a big no-no because it doesn't acknowledge her individual experience.\n\nSo, the author's actions led to her feeling attacked and unappreciated. Even if his intention was to express frustration, the way he did it was hurtful. Therefore, he's likely in the wrong here. The answer should be A.\n"
