We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she cancels their plans when she's on her period. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The girlfriend is described as great, funny, laid back, and they've been living together for three months. The main issue is that during her period, she cancels plans and stays home, which the author finds frustrating. The specific incident was a pre-planned date night that she canceled, leading to the author making a passive-aggressive comment about other women not acting this way. She then had a strong emotional reaction, leading to a rift.\n\nNow, the author's reasoning: he's upset because she's canceling plans despite knowing about them weeks in advance, and he feels she could put in more effort. He's not angry, just a bit passive-aggressive. The girlfriend's reaction was intense\u2014crying, yelling, locking herself in her room. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants an opinion.\n\nKey points to consider: Period-related cramps can be severe and affect daily activities. Comparing his girlfriend to others (even if not directly) can be hurtful. Communication is crucial in relationships. The author's comment, while not shouted, might come off as dismissive of her physical condition. Even if he didn't mean to be angry, the remark could invalidate her feelings and experiences. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that the comment was deeply offensive. \n\nIs it fair to expect her to push through pain? Probably not. Menstrual cramps can be debilitating. The author's frustration is understandable, but the way he expressed it was inappropriate. Comparing her to others implies that her reaction is abnormal or exaggerated, which is not helpful and can be damaging. The girlfriend's response indicates that the comment crossed a line, so the author might be in the wrong for not respecting her boundaries and for making a comparison that hurt her feelings. \n\nTherefore, the answer is likely A (yes, the author is in the wrong). The passive-aggressive comment about other women not acting like this, even if not intended as anger, was dismissive of her legitimate health issue and led to a negative reaction. The user should reflect on how to better support her during her period and find a more compassionate way to communicate his feelings.\n"
