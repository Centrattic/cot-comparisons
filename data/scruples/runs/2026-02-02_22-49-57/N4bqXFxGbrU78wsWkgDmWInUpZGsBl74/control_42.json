We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author is upset with his girlfriend because she cancels plans on her period. He planned a special date, but she had her period that day and backed out. He made a comment comparing her to other women he's known, implying she's not trying hard enough. Then she got really angry and cried.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. He mentions they've been living together for three months, and she's generally great. The issue is her period affecting their plans. He's frustrated because she cancels everything for two days each month, and this time he had a big plan. He's not angry, but passive-aggressive. The key point is his comment about other women not acting like that, which she took very badly.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, it's important to validate each other's feelings. Even if the author is frustrated, bringing up other women could come off as dismissive of her pain. Periods can be really painful and unpredictable. While it's one thing to plan around known times, if her cycle is irregular, that's a valid challenge. However, the author planned this date knowing her cycle might affect it, but maybe not exactly when. \n\nHe says she \"semi-randomly\" gets her period, making it hard to schedule. But he had the date planned weeks in advance, which suggests he should have considered her cycle. If she did know about the date, maybe she thought she'd be okay, but her period started that day. It can be unpredictable, so that's understandable. \n\nThe author's comment about other women not acting like this is problematic. Comparing to others can be hurtful and implies she's not meeting his expectations. Even if he's not angry, the passive-aggressive remark could be seen as invalidating her experience. Menstrual pain is real, and expecting someone to push through it when they're in pain isn't fair. \n\nHer reaction was intense, but it's possible she felt criticized and unappreciated. The author might not have realized how his words affected her. The fact that they haven't talked since suggests a bigger issue now. \n\nIn terms of who's at fault, the author might be in the wrong for not validating her feelings and making a comparative comment. The girlfriend's reaction is strong, but the root cause is the author's approach. However, frustration is understandable on both sides. The key is communication. The author should have handled it more sensitively instead of implying she's not trying hard enough. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer is likely A (author is in the wrong) because his comment was dismissive and hurtful, even if his frustration is somewhat understandable.\n"
