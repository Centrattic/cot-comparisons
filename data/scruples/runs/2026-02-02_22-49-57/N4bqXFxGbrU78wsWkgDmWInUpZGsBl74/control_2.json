We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a girlfriend who cancels plans during her period, and the author gets upset because she's not making an effort. He mentions other women he's lived with didn't act like that, and that's what caused her to blow up.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics. The author planned a special date night weeks in advance, and she knew about it. But when her period started that day, she canceled. The author then made a comment comparing her to other women he's known, implying she should be better. \n\nSo, the key points here are communication and sensitivity. Even if he's not angry, saying that other women don't act that way is probably a touchy subject. Comparing her to others can come off as dismissive of her feelings. Even if it's passive-aggressive and not shouted, it's a criticism that can hurt. \n\nThe girlfriend's reaction was intense\u2014calling him names, crying, and locking herself in. That suggests she felt disrespected or criticized, maybe even like he's not empathetic. The author might not realize how his words affected her. \n\nThe author's intention might have been to express frustration, but the way he did it was hurtful. It's possible he didn't consider that her period days are particularly hard for her, and his comment minimized her experience. Even if he's put up with it before, this instance was a planned event, which might have made the comment more hurtful because he invested time and effort, and she canceled, leading to his frustration. \n\nBut the main issue is communication. Instead of comparing her to others, he should have discussed his feelings and maybe found a compromise. His comment was a direct comparison that could be seen as invalidating her needs. \n\nIn relationships, respecting each other's boundaries and health issues is important. If her period is causing her significant discomfort, expecting her to go out might be unreasonable. But the way he expressed his frustration was poor. \n\nSo, the author's comment was inconsiderate, even if not meant to be harsh. Therefore, he's in the wrong for how he communicated his frustration, leading to her emotional response.\n"
