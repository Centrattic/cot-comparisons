We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let's start by reading the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is upset because his girlfriend doesn't want to go out when she's on her period. They've been living together for three months, and she's usually laid back. The problem is her period. For the first two days, she doesn't do anything and cancels plans. He mentions that her periods come at a random time each month, making it hard to plan. He's usually okay with this but got upset once when she canceled a special date night they had planned weeks in advance. He told her, in a passive-aggressive way, that other women he's lived with don't act like this, even when on their period, implying she could try harder. She got extremely upset, angry, cried, and they haven't talked since. Now he's asking if he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The author made a comment comparing his current girlfriend to other women he's known, suggesting that they don't act the same way during their period. He did this in a passive-aggressive tone, not angry, but maybe still hurtful. The girlfriend reacted strongly, which makes him question his actions.\n\nFrom a general perspective, periods can cause physical discomfort, and it's common for some people to feel less like socializing or doing activities. However, the author's approach was to compare her to others, which can be seen as dismissive. Comparing one's experience to others isn't helpful and can make the person feel invalidated. The fact that he mentioned other women could imply that her reaction is excessive or that she's being uncooperative, which is likely what upset her.\n\nHe had planned a special date that she canceled because she was on her period. Even though she knew about the plans in advance, her period started that day. He might be frustrated because she canceled something they both wanted to do. However, using a passive-aggressive comment to express that frustration might not be the best way to handle it. The girlfriend's strong reaction suggests that the comment hit a nerve, possibly making her feel unappreciated or criticized for her bodily needs.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The author didn't express his feelings in a way that validated her experience. Instead of acknowledging her discomfort and maybe suggesting alternatives (like a different plan if she's up for it), he compared her to others. That approach is likely to cause defensiveness.\n\nIt's also important to consider that periods can be unpredictable. Even though the author mentioned she knew about the plans, periods can start unexpectedly. However, the author's frustration is understandable, but how he expressed it is problematic.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is in the wrong because he invalidated her experience by comparing her to others and used passive-aggressive communication. The girlfriend's reaction, while intense, shows that the comment was hurtful, which means he crossed a line in how he addressed the situation. He should have approached the situation with more empathy and understanding rather than criticism.\n\nSo, the answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
