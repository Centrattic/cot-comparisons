We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend over her not wanting to go out when she's on her period.\n\nFirst, the context: They've been living together for three months. The girlfriend cancels plans when she's on her period, especially the first two days. The author plans a special date night, but she cancels because her period started that day. He makes a passive-aggressive comment comparing her to other women he's lived with, which leads to her blowing up and crying.\n\nSo, the key points here. The author planned something special, expecting her to be up for it. She had prior knowledge of the plans but canceled last minute because her period started. The author's issue is that she cancels, and he feels she could put in more effort. The girlfriend's reaction is intense, indicating that his comment was hurtful.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and empathy. Periods can be really painful for some people. Cramps, fatigue, mood swings\u2014these are real and valid. The author acknowledges that \"girls get cramps and shit,\" but then compares her to other women who don't act like this. That comparison is problematic. It's dismissive of her experience and implies that her pain isn't valid in comparison to others.\n\nThe author's approach was to voice his frustration in a passive-aggressive manner, which might have been disrespectful. Even if he's not angry, the way he communicated his feelings could have been insensitively framed. Phrases like \"I know other women who don't act like this\" imply that his girlfriend's behavior isn't normal or acceptable, which can be very hurtful.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction\u2014being upset, crying, and locking herself in her room\u2014shows that his words deeply affected her. This suggests that his comments were not just about her period but possibly touched on deeper insecurities or stress related to her health or how she's perceived in the relationship.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the author is in a position where he needs to communicate his needs and understand hers. However, his method here was flawed. Instead of approaching the situation with empathy and discussing how to handle future plans when she's unwell, he made a comparison that belittled her experience. \n\nEven if the author felt frustrated, the way he expressed it was not supportive. Healthy communication involves respecting each other's boundaries and feelings. By pointing out that others don't act like this, he undermined her legitimate needs, which is a breach in mutual respect.\n\nTherefore, the author is partly in the wrong. He should have handled the situation with more empathy and found a way to express his feelings without making her feel invalidated. The girlfriend's reaction, while intense, is a response to feeling dismissed and judged, which is a common reaction when someone's pain isn't acknowledged.\n"
