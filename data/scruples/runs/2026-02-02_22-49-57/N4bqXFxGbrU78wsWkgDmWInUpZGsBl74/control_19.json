We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author's girlfriend cancels plans when she's on her period, which he finds frustrating. He planned a special date night, but she bailed last minute because her period started. He told her that other women he's known don't act that way, implying she could do better. She got really upset, called him names, and they haven't talked since. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author acknowledges that his girlfriend is usually great and laid-back, but this period issue is a problem. He's been living with her for three months. Her behavior during her period is to cancel everything, stay home, and not make plans. He mentions that he can't schedule around it because her period comes at random times each month. However, in this specific instance, he had planned a date weeks in advance, and she knew about it. She still canceled it, and he expressed frustration by comparing her to other women he's known, which led to a big argument.\n\nSo, the main issue here is his response to her canceling the plans. Even though he wasn't angry, he used passive-aggressive comments about other women. That's probably where things went wrong. Comparing her to other women is a classic mistake in relationships. It can come off as dismissive of her feelings and experiences. Even if he's trying to be reasonable, pointing out that others don't act the same way can invalidate her pain and stress.\n\nHe should have considered that her period might be more severe than what he's experienced before or different from other women he's known. Every woman's experience with menstruation is different. Some have severe cramps, others might have other symptoms. By bringing up other women, he's not acknowledging her individual situation. It's possible that she's already feeling vulnerable and stressed, and his comment made her feel judged or unappreciated.\n\nAlso, the fact that she locked herself in her room and hasn't talked to him since suggests that his words hurt her deeply. The outburst and crying indicate that his comment crossed a line. Even if he didn't mean to be cruel, the way he phrased his concern was damaging. He should have approached it with more empathy, maybe asking how she was feeling instead of implying she should push through the discomfort for him.\n\nAnother angle is the planning aspect. He planned the date in advance, which is great, but maybe he didn't account for her period's unpredictability. However, she knew about the plans, so maybe she thought she could manage, but her period started. His frustration is understandable, but his response was inappropriate. The key here is communication. Instead of making a passive-aggressive comment, he should have discussed his feelings in a more supportive way.\n\nIn relationships, it's important to validate each other's experiences. By not doing that and instead comparing her to others, he invalidated her. That's a common reason for conflicts. So, yes, the author is in the wrong because his approach was dismissive and hurtful, even if his intention was to express frustration. The answer should be A.\n"
