We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author getting upset with his girlfriend because she cancels plans when she's on her period. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The girlfriend is described as great, but she cancels plans for the first two days of her period. The author usually puts up with it but had a special date night planned weeks in advance. She canceled that day when she started her period. The author told her, in a passive-aggressive way, that other women he's known don't act like this and implied she should try harder. She then got extremely upset, angry, and cried.\n\nSo, the main issue here is the author's communication. Even though he was trying to be calm, his comment about other women and suggesting she should make more effort is likely hurtful. It's important to consider that period-related cramps and discomfort are real and can affect someone's ability to engage in activities. Comparing her to other women he's known is invalidating her experience and could come off as dismissive.\n\nAlso, the fact that he had planned the date in advance and she knew about it doesn't excuse his reaction. He might be feeling frustrated, but how he communicated that frustration was the problem. The girlfriend's strong reaction indicates that his words were offensive and hurtful.\n\nAnother angle is empathy. The author might not fully understand the severity of her discomfort. Even if periods are a regular part of life, each person's experience varies. His comment could be seen as minimizing her pain. Additionally, the passive-aggressive tone isn't helpful in resolving conflicts and can escalate them.\n\nThe key here is that the author's approach was not supportive. Instead of expressing his feelings without blaming, he made a comparison that undermined her. Effective communication would involve discussing his feelings without invalidating hers. For example, \"I feel disappointed when we have to cancel, but I understand that you're going through something. How can we make this work?\" That approach might lead to a better resolution.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is in the wrong because his comment was hurtful, invalidated her experience, and was delivered in a passive-aggressive manner. The girlfriend's reaction is a valid response to being belittled and criticized for a natural bodily function.\n"
