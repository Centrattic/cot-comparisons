We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author getting upset with his girlfriend for canceling plans when she's on her period. The key points here are the context of their relationship, the specific incident where the author made a comment comparing his girlfriend's behavior to other women's, and the resulting argument.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. Menstrual cramps can be really painful for some women, and it's not uncommon for them to feel unwell during their period. The author mentions that she cancels plans for the first two days and stays on the couch. It's important to recognize that even if she's laid back normally, during her period she might be in pain and have valid reasons to cancel plans. The author planned a special date night, which she knew about weeks in advance, but still canceled last minute when her period started that day.\n\nNow, the author's comment about other women he's lived with not acting this way during their periods is problematic. Comparing his current girlfriend to others is a form of invalidation. Even if it's not said angrily, it's a passive-aggressive way of suggesting she's not doing enough. This could be hurtful because it implies she's not managing her period well compared to others, which isn't fair. Everyone's experience with menstruation is different, and what one woman can handle, another might not. The girlfriend's reaction was intense, but it's possible that the comment made her feel disrespected or not understood.\n\nThe author's main issue is that he's frustrated by the unpredictability and the last-minute cancellations, especially when he's made plans. However, his approach was to criticize and compare, which likely escalated the situation. The girlfriend's anger and crying response indicate that the comment hit a nerve. It's important to communicate support during her period rather than expecting her to push through pain. The author might not be \"in the wrong\" in the sense that he's justified in being upset about canceled plans, but his method of expressing that frustration was inappropriate. He should have addressed the issue without making a comparison to other women, which is the root of the conflict here.\n\nSo, considering the girlfriend's health and the way the author communicated his feelings, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong for how he handled the situation. Comparing her to others was hurtful and not supportive, which is a key factor in determining if he's the asshole here.\n"
