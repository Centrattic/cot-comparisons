We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend over her not wanting to go out when she's on her period. He set up a special date night that she canceled because she was on her period. He told her he's known other women who don't act that way during their periods, implying she should make more effort. She got really angry, called him names, cried, and they haven't talked since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider if his actions were reasonable. He planned something special, but her period is a valid health issue. Many women do experience severe cramps and discomfort, so canceling plans might be necessary. However, his comment about other women acting differently is probably the problem. Comparing her to others could be hurtful and minimize her experience. Even if he wasn't angry, the passive-aggressive tone and the comparison might have made her feel unappreciated or disbelieved. She might have felt pressured to go out despite not feeling well, which could add stress. The fact that her response was so intense suggests that his words were deeply offensive to her. In relationships, supporting each other through health issues is important, and maybe he should have been more understanding instead of questioning her actions. So, likely the author is in the wrong here. Answer A.\n"
