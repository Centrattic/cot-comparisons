We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is about the author getting upset with his girlfriend because she cancels their plans when she's on her period. The key points here are communication, expectations, and how he expressed his feelings.\n\nFirst, the girlfriend cancels plans when she's on her period, which the author has been putting up with. But this one time, he had a special date planned weeks in advance, and she bailed on him. He then expressed his frustration by comparing her to other women he's lived with, implying she could do better. She got extremely upset and angry, leading to a breakdown in communication.\n\nNow, considering the dynamics, the author's frustration is understandable. Planned events can be important for couples, and it's natural to feel let down. However, the way he expressed his feelings might be problematic. Comparing her to others, even if not directly confrontational, can come off as dismissive of her experience with period pain. It might make her feel like her needs aren't valid, which is a sensitive topic. \n\nAlso, the girlfriend's reaction suggests that this issue has been a point of contention before. The author mentions she's usually laid back, but this outburst indicates that she feels disrespected. The fact that she locked herself in her room and they haven't talked since shows the severity of the situation. \n\nThe author might not be entirely in the wrong for feeling upset, but the way he communicated his feelings could have been more empathetic. Instead of bringing up other women, which might minimize her experience, he could have expressed his own feelings without comparison. That might have fostered a better dialogue. So while he's not completely at fault, his approach likely contributed to the conflict. Therefore, the answer is A, meaning he is in the wrong for how he expressed his feelings despite understandable frustration.\n"
