We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she cancels plans when she's on her period. He mentions that she's usually very laid back and great, but during her period, she's uninterested in doing anything. He had a special date night planned in advance, but she canceled it. He made a comment, maybe passive-aggressively, about other women not acting that way during their periods. She then exploded with anger and cried.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the cultural and social context. In many societies, it's common for people to have different levels of sensitivity around women's menstrual cycles. The girlfriend's reaction might be partly due to the stress of her period and the fact that her plans were canceled. The author's comment could be seen as dismissive of her physical discomfort. Even if he didn't mean to be harsh, comparing her to others and implying she should be more effortful might have been hurtful. \n\nNext, communication styles matter. The author says he wasn't angry but maybe passive-aggressive. Passive-aggressive behavior can often be perceived as rude or disrespectful, even if the intention isn't to be. The girlfriend might have felt criticized or invalidated, which could explain her strong reaction. \n\nAlso, the fact that her period is irregular adds another layer. If he can't reliably schedule around it, that's a challenge, but it's not her fault. However, his frustration led him to make a comparison that could be hurtful. It's important to validate her feelings instead of minimizing them. \n\nIn relationships, it's crucial to consider how your words are received. Even if the intention was to express mild disappointment, the way it was phrased might have been the problem. The girlfriend's anger could stem from feeling that her pain isn't respected. \n\nSo, putting it all together, while the author might have been trying to express his feelings, his approach was flawed. Comparing her to other women and suggesting she should make more effort could be seen as invalidating her experience. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong here.\n"
