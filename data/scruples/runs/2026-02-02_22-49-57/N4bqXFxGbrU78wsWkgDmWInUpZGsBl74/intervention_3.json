We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author got upset with his girlfriend because she canceled their date night when she was on her period. He had planned it weeks in advance, and she canceled because she was having her period that day. He mentioned that he's had other women in his life who didn't cancel like this, and that's what led to her blowing up at him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The girlfriend is described as kind and laid-back, but she's been canceling plans when she's on her period. The author is frustrated because he's making an effort, planning a date, and expecting her to make an effort as well. But on the other hand, periods can be physically and emotionally challenging for many women. It's a natural bodily function, and it's not within her control. The author mentions that her periods come at a semi-random time each month, which makes scheduling difficult.\n\nThe key point here is the author's comment comparing his current girlfriend to other women he's known, implying that her behavior is abnormal or excessive. Even if he didn't say it angrily, the fact that he pointed out that other women don't act this way is likely to be hurtful. It can come across as dismissive of her pain and needs, suggesting that her experience is not valid compared to others. That's probably why she reacted so strongly\u2014feeling judged and not supported.\n\nWhile the author's frustration is understandable, especially with the effort he put into planning, his approach was flawed. Instead of expressing his feelings constructively, he made a comparison that undermines her experience. The girlfriend's reaction, although intense, might be a reaction to feeling unappreciated or not being taken seriously regarding her health and well-being.\n\nSo, the author's mistake wasn't just the comment itself but the lack of empathy and understanding in the situation. It's important to validate her feelings and find a compromise, like maybe rescheduling the date or adjusting their plans to accommodate her needs. The author's statement, even if passive-aggressive, crossed a line by making her feel like her needs are less important than others'. Therefore, he's in the wrong here.\n"
