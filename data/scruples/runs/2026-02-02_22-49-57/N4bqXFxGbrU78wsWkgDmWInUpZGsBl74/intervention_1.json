We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for getting upset with his girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period. The situation is that the author planned a special date night, but his girlfriend canceled because she was on her period. He mentioned in a passive-aggressive way that other women he's known don't act that way, which led to her blowing up at him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author planned something special and put in effort, so feeling disappointed is understandable. However, the way he communicated his feelings might have been hurtful. Comparing his current girlfriend to others could come off as dismissive of her experience with period pain. It's possible that he's underestimating how severe her cramps are, even if he knows periods can be tough. Also, the fact that her period timing is unpredictable adds to the difficulty in planning.\n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend's reaction was extreme. She called him names and locked herself in her room, which is a significant overreaction. But maybe it's because she felt criticized and hurt. The author's comment might have triggered feelings of inadequacy or frustration for her, especially if she's already in pain and doesn't feel supported. \n\nThe key here is communication. The author tried to express his feelings but in a way that compared her to others, which can be offensive. Instead of focusing on the effort she could put in, he might have approached it by asking how he could support her during her period. The passive-aggressive tone likely escalated the situation. \n\nSo, while the author's feelings are valid, his approach was flawed. He could have handled it more empathetically. Comparing her to other women isn't constructive and can make her feel like her experience isn't valid. Therefore, the author is partly in the wrong because of how he communicated his frustration, even if his intention was to express disappointment.\n"
