We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong. The situation involves the girlfriend not wanting to go out when she's on her period, which the author is upset about. \n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author planned a special date night weeks in advance, and the girlfriend canceled because she started her period. The author expressed frustration, comparing her to other women he's lived with who don't act like this. The girlfriend reacted very angrily, calling him names and locking herself in her room.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, he had put in effort, maybe even expecting the girlfriend to make an effort despite her period. He might feel that his needs are being neglected, especially since he mentions she cancels plans every month without notice. But the girlfriend's reaction was extreme, which is a key point.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author was wrong to express his feelings, even if it was passive-aggressive. He didn't get angry, but made a comparison. The girlfriend's reaction suggests that the comment hit a nerve, possibly because it invalidated her experience with period-related discomfort. The author might not have considered that his comparison could be hurtful, even if he didn't mean to be malicious.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author's frustration is valid, but how he communicated it might have been a problem. By saying other women don't act like this, he might be implying that she's overreacting or not managing her symptoms, which could be seen as dismissive. The girlfriend's extreme reaction might stem from feeling criticized or invalidated during a time when she's already feeling unwell.\n\nSo, even if the author's intention was to express his feelings, the way he did it could have been hurtful. It's possible that he didn't take into account her feelings and the physical discomfort she was experiencing. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not handling the situation with more empathy and understanding, even if his frustration is understandable.\n"
