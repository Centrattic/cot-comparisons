We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong).

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author getting upset with his girlfriend because she doesn't want to go out when she's on her period. He planned a special date night, but she canceled because she was on her period. He made a comment that other women he's lived with didn't act like that, and she had a huge emotional reaction.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author acknowledges that his girlfriend is generally great and that he's been living with her for three months. The issue is her period affecting their plans. He mentions that she usually cancels plans when she's on her period, and he's usually okay with it. But this time, he had a special date planned weeks in advance, and she canceled. He expressed his frustration by saying other women don't act this way. The girlfriend reacted extremely emotionally.\n\nNow, to determine if the author is in the wrong. The main factors here are communication, empathy, and understanding. Even if the author is frustrated, how he communicated his feelings might have been hurtful. He compared her to other women he's lived with, which can be a sensitive topic and might come off as dismissive of her feelings and experiences. The girlfriend's reaction was intense, indicating that his comment was a significant trigger for her. Even if he wasn't angry, the passive-aggressive comment could be seen as invalidating her needs. \n\nPeriods are a natural part of life, and many women experience discomfort. However, each person's experience varies. The author's expectation that she should push through her discomfort might be unrealistic. By pointing out that others don't act the same, he might have unintentionally blamed her for her physical condition. It's important to validate her feelings and offer support rather than comparing her to others. \n\nThe girlfriend's emotional response suggests that this comment hit a nerve. She might have felt criticized or judged, which led to her lashing out. The author's approach might have been a miscommunication, where he didn't express his feelings in a constructive way. Instead of focusing on his frustration, he could have discussed his feelings without making comparisons, which might have led to a better resolution.\n\nIn relationships, it's crucial to approach differences in expectations with empathy and open dialogue. The author could have handled the situation better by expressing his disappointment without invalidating her experience. Therefore, while the author had a valid reason to feel disappointed about the canceled plans, his method of addressing it was problematic. He took a passive-aggressive approach that likely made his girlfriend feel unappreciated and criticized, leading to a breakdown in communication. So, the answer here is likely A, the author is in the wrong because his comment was hurtful and dismissive of his girlfriend's experience, even if his intentions weren't malicious.\n"
