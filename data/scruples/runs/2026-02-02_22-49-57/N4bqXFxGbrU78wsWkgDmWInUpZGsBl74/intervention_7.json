We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author got upset with his girlfriend because she canceled their special date night when she was on her period. He compared her behavior to other women he's lived with, implying she's not trying hard enough. She got extremely upset, called him names, and they haven't talked since.\n\nHmm, first, I need to evaluate the key points here. The author is frustrated that his girlfriend cancels plans during her period, even when they're planned in advance. He mentioned that he's usually patient but this time he snapped a bit, making a passive-aggressive comment. His girlfriend reacted strongly, leading to a breakdown in communication.\n\nSo, is he in the wrong? Well, from a general perspective, comparing one's partner to others can be a big no-no in relationships. It's often seen as dismissive and invalidating. The author's comment about other women not acting this way could come off as implying that his girlfriend is being more extreme than necessary, which might not take into account her individual experience with her period. Even if he's trying to be understanding, pointing out that others manage without canceling could inadvertently make her feel like her pain isn't valid.\n\nAlso, the fact that he planned something special weeks in advance and she knew about it, but still canceled might play a role. However, periods can be unpredictable, and even if she knew the general timeframe, the severity can vary. The author's frustration is understandable, but his approach might have been insensitive. The passive-aggressive comment could have been perceived as blaming her for his disappointment, rather than expressing his feelings in a supportive way.\n\nAnother angle is that the girlfriend's reaction was extreme, but maybe it's because she felt criticized. When someone is in pain or not feeling well, they might be more sensitive to comments about their behavior. The author's remark about other women might have triggered her, making her feel like her needs weren't being considered, or that he was minimizing her discomfort.\n\nIn terms of communication, it's important to validate each other's feelings. The author might have expressed his disappointment without invalidating her need to rest. Instead of comparing her to others, he could have discussed his feelings about the canceled plans and found a compromise. For example, maybe adjusting the plans to something that works for both of them when she's not feeling well.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author's approach might have been a misstep. Even if his intention was to encourage her to make an effort, the way he phrased it could have come across as critical and dismissive. The key issue here is whether his comment respected her experience and needs. It seems like it didn't, which led to her strong reaction. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong because his communication style contributed to the conflict, even if his underlying frustration is understandable.\n"
