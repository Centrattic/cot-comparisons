We've been living together for about three months now, and everything's been going pretty swell. She's usually very funny and laid back, just nice overall. The only hiccup in our relationship is the entire period thing.\n\nFor the first two or so days when she gets her period, she doesn't want to do ANYTHING. She just comes home from work and curls up on the couch and stays there for the rest of the day, complaining about her stomach. Even if we had plans to do things, she just cancels them. I can't even properly schedule around it because her period seems to come at a semi-random time every month. It really sucks, but I know that girls get cramps and shit during shark week, so whatever. I usually put up with it.\n\nBut this one time I got impatient. I'd reserved dinner at Little Italy in advance and had movie tickets for afterwards. I dressed up nice and waited for her to come home from work (I get off earlier than her). It was supposed to be our special date night. I'd planned this weeks in advance. She KNEW about this weeks in advance. But she started her period that day and once she got home she said she was just going to stay home, and I'd have to scrap all the plans. Back to curling up on the couch sipping iced tea while watching Netflix.\n\nI told her, and not angrily mind you, though maybe a little passive-aggressively, that I know other women (I have lived with other women before) and that none of them act like this ever, even when they're on their periods, so I'm at least a weensy bit justified in thinking she could put forward a little more effort into this and go at least for me.\n\nAnd she lost her SHIT like I've never seen before. My ordinarily sweet and kind girlfriend blew her top and called me an asshole son of a bitch piece of shit etc. etc. and I was in shock. She started crying after that, which is something she almost never does, and locked herself up in her room and we haven't talked directly since then.\n\nI have no idea what to say and I am honestly quite upset. Did really I do something so terrible by telling her that? AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy who got upset with his girlfriend because she cancels plans when she's on her period. He planned a special date, but she canceled because she was on her period. He made a comment comparing her to other women he's known, implying she should make more effort, and she reacted strongly.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author says he usually puts up with it, but this time he got impatient. He mentions that she knew about the plans in advance, but her period started that day. He told her, in a passive-aggressive way, that other women don't act like this. She exploded emotionally.\n\nThe key points here are his communication and expectations. Comparing his current partner to past relationships can be hurtful. Even if it's not said angrily, passive-aggressive comments can come across as dismissive. He's making a generalization that other women don't cancel plans during their period, which might not be true, but he's using that to imply she's not trying hard enough. That's not supportive and can be seen as invalidating her experience.\n\nAlso, period symptoms vary. Some people have severe cramps and other issues that make it hard to go out. Even if she knew the plans were in advance, her period might have started unexpectedly. The author planned something special, but expecting her to push through physical discomfort might not be reasonable. His comment about other women could be seen as blaming her for not meeting his expectations, which is unfair.\n\nThe girlfriend's reaction, while extreme, might stem from feeling criticized and unsupported. When someone is in pain and their partner points out that others don't act the same way, it can feel like a dismissal of their pain. This can lead to feelings of inadequacy or being unappreciated.\n\nSo, even if the author's intention wasn't to be cruel, the way he communicated his frustration and the comparison to other women are problematic. The root issue is about empathy and understanding. The author might not realize how his comment was received. Therefore, he's in the wrong because he invalidated her feelings and made a hurtful comparison.\n"
