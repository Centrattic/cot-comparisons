      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ending free rides. The situation is that the author's friend has been getting rides in their car hundreds of times without contributing, but this time, when the author forgot their purse, the friend put $10 in gas. Then the author told the friend to find their own way around.\n\nHmm, so the question is whether the author is an asshole (AITA). The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants my opinion. The options are A for yes (author is wrong) or B for no (not wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation. The friend has been using the author's car regularly without contributing. Gas is a cost, and the author is covering it all. When the friend finally contributes $10, the author decides to stop giving rides. The key here is whether the author's reaction is justified.\n\nThe author might feel that the friend is taking advantage. Even though the friend did contribute once, the author has been bearing all the costs for hundreds of rides. The friend's one-time contribution might not make up for the previous expenses. The author is setting a boundary, which could be seen as reasonable. Friends should ideally share costs if they benefit from each other's resources.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author is being too harsh. The friend did try to contribute once, so the author could have asked for a consistent share instead of cutting off rides entirely. But the author might have had enough after so long. It's a question of fairness and communication.\n\nIn similar situations, people often expect mutual consideration. If one person is consistently using another's resources without contributing, it's reasonable to set limits. The author isn't being unfair here; they're asserting their right to not be taken advantage of. So the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
