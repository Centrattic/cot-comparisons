      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the friend has been taking free rides in the author's car a lot. The author mentions that they fill up the tank and pick up the friend, but the friend only put $10 in gas once when the author forgot their purse. Now the author is asking if they're an asshole for telling the friend to find their own way around.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations here. The friend has been using the car for rides hundreds of times without contributing to gas costs. The one time they did contribute was when the author forgot their purse, which seems like a different situation. The author is probably frustrated about the financial burden of the gas, especially if they're doing this frequently. \n\nIs it reasonable for the author to expect some contribution to gas? If the friend is getting rides all the time, maybe they should chip in, especially if the author is covering the costs. But then again, sometimes friends do favors for each other without expecting payment. However, when it's a significant expense like gas, it's understandable that the author might want some help.\n\nThe friend putting in $10 was a one-time thing. If the author expects regular contributions, then ending the rides makes sense. The author isn't asking for a lot, just to stop giving free rides. The friend's actions of relying on the author for transportation without contributing might be seen as taking advantage. \n\nIs there any cultural or social norm that dictates this? In some contexts, friends might expect to split gas costs when carpooling, especially if it's a regular occurrence. If the author hasn't communicated their expectations before, maybe they should have. But since the friend hasn't contributed before except once, the author's reaction might be justified. \n\nAlso, the friend's response to the author's request is important. If the friend is upset or offended, maybe the author should reconsider. But the author is within their rights to set boundaries. They can choose to stop giving rides if they feel it's unfair.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to expect some contribution towards gas if they're covering the costs consistently. The friend's lack of contribution over time is the issue here. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
