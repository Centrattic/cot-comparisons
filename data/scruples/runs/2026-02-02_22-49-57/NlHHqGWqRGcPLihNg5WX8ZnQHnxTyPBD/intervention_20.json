      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The friend has been taking rides in their car hundreds of times without contributing to gas, but this past weekend, the friend put $10 in gas. The author then told the friend to find their own way around.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has been relying on the author for transportation frequently without contributing, which could be seen as taking advantage. The author is covering the gas costs and making the trips themselves. The fact that the friend only contributed once, when reminded, might indicate that they haven't been fair in sharing the cost all along. \n\nThe author's decision to stop the rides could be about fairness and setting boundaries. It's reasonable for someone to expect that if they're using someone else's car regularly, they should contribute to the expenses, especially gas. The author might feel that their patience has been tested by the friend's consistent free-riding, even if the friend did make a one-time contribution.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend might not realize the impact of their actions or might assume it's a given that the author will cover the costs. However, the author has the right to set limits, especially if the friend hasn't been contributing as expected. The key here is whether the author's reaction is proportionate. The friend did put $10 in gas once, but that's just a small amount compared to the hundreds of times they've ridden for free. The author is now asking the friend to find their own way, which is a reasonable boundary to enforce fairness.\n\nSo, considering the situation, the author is not in the wrong. They've been covering costs without reciprocal support from the friend, and setting a boundary is justified. The answer should be B.\n"
