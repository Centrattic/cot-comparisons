      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the friend often rides in their car, and the author fills up the tank. Last time, the friend put $10 in gas because the author forgot their purse, and when they asked for it back, the author told them to find their own way around.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend has used the author's car hundreds of times without contributing to gas. This might imply an unspoken agreement where the friend expects the author to cover the costs. But the author is now ending it, asking them to take responsibility. The friend's $10 contribution was a one-time thing, and when the author asked for it back, the friend didn't return it. The author then decides to stop providing rides.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the author might feel they're being taken advantage of. The friend benefits repeatedly without contributing, and when there's a minor instance of the friend contributing, the author is asking for that back. The author's request for the friend to find their own way seems like a reasonable boundary if they feel the arrangement is one-sided. \n\nHowever, the friend might argue that they were trying to help by putting gas in once, but the author is now cutting off all rides. But given that the friend rarely contributes, the author's stance could be justified. The key here is whether the author's action is a reasonable response to a situation where they've been covering all costs. The friend's past behavior of not contributing much might make the author's decision fair.\n\nSo, the answer would likely be B (No), meaning the author is not in the wrong. They're setting a boundary after frequent one-sided use of their car.\n"
