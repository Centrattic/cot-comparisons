      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong for ending free friend rides. The situation is that the friend regularly rides in their car, and the author fills up the gas tank and picks them up. The friend put $10 in gas once when the author forgot their purse and later asked for it back. The author then said the friend should find their way around in the future.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the author is being unreasonable. The friend has been using the car hundreds of times without contributing to gas. The one time they did put gas in was a specific instance when the author forgot their purse, and then they asked for the money back. The author is ending the rides, possibly because they feel the friend isn't contributing fairly. \n\nThe key points here are fairness and boundaries. The author is setting a boundary, which is within their rights. The friend might not have a car, so relying on others for transport is common, but when it's one-sided, it can create resentment. The author isn't obligated to provide transportation, so ending it isn't necessarily wrong. The friend's action of putting gas in once and then asking for it back might be seen as a one-time courtesy, not a regular contribution. \n\nHowever, the author's tone of \"find your way around\" could come off as abrupt. Maybe a more diplomatic approach is better, but the core issue is the author's right to set boundaries. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
