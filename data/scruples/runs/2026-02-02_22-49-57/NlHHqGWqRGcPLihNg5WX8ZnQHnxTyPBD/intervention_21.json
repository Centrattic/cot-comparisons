      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for ending free friend rides in their car. The situation is that the friend often takes rides, the author fills up the gas and picks them up. Last weekend, the friend put $10 in gas because the author forgot their purse at home and asked for it back. The author then told the friend to find their way around in the future.\n\nThe user thinks the author is not wrong. They want to know if the author is in the wrong, answer A for yes, B for no. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the scenario. The friend has been getting rides without contributing to gas costs. This time, they put in $10 when the author forgot their purse, and then the author asked for it back. The friend is probably expecting to continue getting rides for free, but the author is now setting a boundary.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author might be justified in expecting some contribution for gas, especially if they're covering the cost themselves. However, the friend might feel they're helping out by putting in $10 when they can. The author's response of telling them to find their own way seems a bit harsh if the friend is just trying to contribute occasionally.\n\nBut the key point here is that the author is setting boundaries. If the friend has been using the author's car regularly without cost, the author has the right to decide that they need to contribute. The friend might not have intended to pay for gas, but when asked back, that's a different situation. The author's reaction could be seen as enforcing a new rule, which is reasonable if they're tired of covering the costs themselves.\n\nHowever, there's a nuance. The author might have been okay with the friend contributing occasionally, but when they asked for the $10 back, it might have felt like the friend was keeping it. The author's response of ending the rides could be a way to stop the friend from expecting free rides, especially if they're not consistently contributing.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's common for people to expect that rides shouldn't be one-sided. If someone regularly uses another's car without contributing, it's reasonable to set a boundary. The author might be in the right for asserting their needs. However, if the friend wasn't aware that they needed to contribute and the author didn't communicate that earlier, there's a possible misunderstanding. But given that the author is now setting a boundary, it's a valid action.\n\nSo considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. They have the right to decide how they use their car and expect some contribution if required. The answer should be B.\n"
