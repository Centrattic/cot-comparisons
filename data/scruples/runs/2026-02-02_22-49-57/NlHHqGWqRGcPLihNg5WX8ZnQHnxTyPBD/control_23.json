      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The person is asking if they're an asshole for ending free rides for their friend. Their friend always rides with them, uses their gas, and this time the friend added $10 to the gas. The person is wondering if they were wrong to tell the friend to find their own way.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has used their car hundreds of times without contributing to gas. This time, the friend paid $10, but the person is ending the arrangement. The key points here are reciprocity and the friend's actions.\n\nThe friend might have felt it was their right to ride for free, but when the person forgot their purse, the friend stepped in to add gas. However, this is just one instance. The person is now cutting off the rides, which could be seen as standing up for themselves after being taken advantage of. \n\nSocial norms often suggest that when someone uses your resources repeatedly without contributing, it's reasonable to set boundaries. The friend's payment this time is a positive step, but the prior behavior of not contributing might have been an issue. The person might have been in a one-sided situation, and ending it isn't necessarily wrong. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the friend didn't realize it was a problem before. The person could have discussed it earlier, but now ending it abruptly might seem harsh. However, given the repeated use without payment, the person is justified in wanting to stop. \n\nI think the answer is B, the person isn't in the wrong. They're setting a boundary after being used. The friend's one-time contribution doesn't negate the prior history. It's reasonable to expect reciprocity, and ending the rides is a way to enforce that.\n"
