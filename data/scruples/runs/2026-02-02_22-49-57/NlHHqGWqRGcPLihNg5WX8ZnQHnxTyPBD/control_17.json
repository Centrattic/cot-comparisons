      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) question is in the wrong. The situation is about ending free rides for a friend. The friend has used the author's car hundreds of times without contributing to gas, except once when the author forgot their purse. The author then told the friend to find their own way around. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. They want the answer as A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The main points are: the friend regularly uses the author's car without paying for gas, except one time when the author forgot their purse. The author then decided to stop offering rides. The question is whether the author is an asshole for doing that.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the author is being consistent. The friend only contributed gas once, and the author is setting a boundary. People often expect reciprocity in favors, so if someone uses your car frequently, contributing to fuel costs is reasonable. The author is asserting their right to set limits, especially if it's becoming a burden. It's also about respecting the author's time and resources. The friend might not have realized the impact of their actions, but the author has the right to change the arrangement. Since the friend didn't contribute most of the time, the author isn't in the wrong for ending the free rides. So the answer should be B.\n"
