      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about ending free rides for a friend. The friend often rides in their car, and the author fills up the gas and picks them up. This time, the friend put in $10 for gas when the author forgot their purse and asked for it back. The author then told the friend to find their way around in the future. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong, but wants confirmation.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the scenario. The friend has taken rides hundreds of times without contributing to gas, but this time they did. The author is asking if it's wrong to stop offering rides now. The key points here are about fairness and expectations. The author is probably feeling that since the friend never contributed before, this one time is a small gesture, but they're cutting them off entirely. Is that fair?\n\nOn one hand, the author might be trying to enforce a policy where the friend contributes to the costs of the rides. The friend's action of putting in $10 might have been an attempt to cover the gas, but the author might be upset because it was only $10, which might not be enough for the trip. Alternatively, maybe the author is frustrated with past behavior and is using this as a reason to stop. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is the one who offered the ride, so they have the right to set boundaries. If the author is tired of the friend not contributing, it's reasonable to ask for some responsibility. The friend might not have realized the impact on the author, and this could be a way to communicate that. \n\nBut is it fair to end the rides entirely over a single instance? The friend did contribute this time, maybe as a good-faith effort. The author could have discussed the issue instead of cutting off the friend. However, the author might feel that the friend has a pattern of not contributing and this was the breaking point. \n\nIn AITA situations, the community often looks at intentions and whether the action is proportionate. The author is asking the friend to cover their own transportation costs, which is reasonable. If the friend is relying on the author for transport without contributing, the author has a right to set a boundary. However, ending all rides might be harsh, but it's their decision. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author is not in the wrong. The answer would be B.\n"
