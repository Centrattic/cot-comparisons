      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for ending free rides. The friend has used their car many times without contributing gas, and this time the friend put in $10 for gas after the author forgot their purse. The author then said that the friend should find their own way around in the future.\n\nHmm, first, I need to assess the situation. The friend has a history of relying on the author for rides without contributing. This time, the friend did give $10 for gas, but the author is ending the arrangement. The key points here are the frequency of the rides, the lack of contribution from the friend, and the author's response.\n\nI think the author has every right to set boundaries. If someone is constantly using your resources without contributing, it's reasonable to decide to stop. The fact that the friend gave $10 this time might not be enough to justify continuing the rides, especially after hundreds of times without any contribution. The author's action is about establishing limits, which is important for healthy relationships. The friend's behavior could be seen as taking advantage. The author isn't being unkind; they're asserting their need to not be taken advantage of. So, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
