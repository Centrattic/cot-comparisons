      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author of the Reddit-style post is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the friend regularly rides in the author's car without contributing to gas, except once when the author forgot their purse and the friend put in $10. Now the author is telling the friend to find their own way around.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The friend has taken hundreds of rides without paying gas, which the author covers by filling up the tank themselves. The one time the friend contributed was when the author forgot their purse, and then the friend paid $10 back. The author now wants to stop providing the rides for free. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, if someone consistently uses your resources (like gas) without contributing, it's reasonable to expect some form of contribution. The friend only paid once, which might not balance out all the rides. The author is asserting their right to use their car as they see fit and not have to subsidize another person's transportation indefinitely.\n\nHowever, maybe the author should have addressed the issue earlier instead of waiting until now. But the friend never made it a habit to pay, so the author might feel it's too late to start expecting payment now. Also, the friend's one-time payment could be seen as a kind gesture, but it doesn't cover the cumulative cost over hundreds of rides.\n\nOn the other hand, friendships often involve some give and take. If the author didn't explicitly agree to this arrangement, they have the right to change their mind. The friend might feel blindsided, but the author is within their rights to set boundaries.\n\nI think the main issue is whether the friend's actions were parasitic or not. Since the friend never contributed except once, the author is justified in ending the arrangement. The author isn't obligated to provide free rides indefinitely. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
