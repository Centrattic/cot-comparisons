      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the friend often rides with them, and the writer fills up the gas and picks them up. This time, the friend put $10 in gas because the writer forgot their purse, and later the friend asked for it back. The writer then said the friend should find their own way around.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. The key points are: the friend has used the writer's car hundreds of times without contributing to gas, except once. The writer is ending the arrangement. The friend now wants to ride less or not at all. The writer is asking if they're an asshole for doing so.\n\nI think the main issue is the expectation of reciprocity. The friend has taken rides without contributing, and when asked to put gas once, they did so and then asked for it back. The writer's response is to end the service. From a fairness standpoint, if someone consistently uses your car without contributing, then expects you to cover costs, it's reasonable to set boundaries. However, the friend's request to get the $10 back might be a point of contention. If the $10 was a contribution, expecting repayment might not be fair unless it was a loan. But the writer might feel that the friend is trying to get something for nothing.\n\nAnother angle: the writer is the one providing the service (rides), and the friend is the one using it. The writer has the right to set terms for their own car. If the friend was using the car without contributing, the writer isn't obligated to provide rides for free. Ending the arrangement isn't necessarily wrong. The friend might feel entitled, but that doesn't mean the writer is in the wrong. The writer could have asked for contributions from the start, but they let it go. Now, when the friend tries to contribute once and then asks for it back, the writer is asserting their boundary. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the writer isn't in the wrong. They're setting a boundary after consistent use without contribution. The answer is B.\n"
