      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about ending free rides for their friend. The friend has been getting rides in their car many times without contributing to gas, except once when the author forgot their purse and the friend put $10 in gas. Now the author is telling the friend to find their own way around.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both sides. The author is frustrated because the friend hasn't contributed to gas except that one time. They're ending the arrangement, which the friend might see as unfair. But the author might feel that it's not fair to cover all the costs alone. The key points here are the frequency of the rides and the lack of contribution except once.\n\nThe friend's action of putting gas once might be seen as a minor gesture, but the author is pointing out that out of hundreds of rides, this was a rare occurrence. The author is asserting their right to not bear the full cost. The question is whether the author is being unreasonable by ending the arrangement.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally expected that if someone uses your resources (like gas) frequently, there might be an expectation of splitting costs, especially if it's a recurring thing. However, friends often have different understandings. The author might not be in the wrong here because they're setting boundaries. On the other hand, the friend might feel hurt if they thought the rides were a given.\n\nBut the author's reasoning is that the friend hasn't contributed except once. So, the author is ending the arrangement to prevent future costs. Whether they're in the wrong depends on whether the friend's one-time contribution was sufficient or if there's an implicit agreement that the friend should help with costs. If the friend never discussed splitting gas, maybe the author is within their rights to set a boundary. However, if the friend expected rides without contributing, the author is justified in stopping.\n\nI think the key here is the lack of contribution from the friend. The author is ending the rides to avoid ongoing costs, which seems reasonable. The friend might need to take responsibility. So the answer is likely B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
