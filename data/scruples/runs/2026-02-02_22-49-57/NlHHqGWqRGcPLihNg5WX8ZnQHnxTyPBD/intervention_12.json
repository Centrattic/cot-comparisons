      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the friend always rides in their car without contributing to gas, except once when the author forgot their purse and the friend put $10 in gas. The author then ended the free rides by telling the friend to find their own way around. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The friend has been riding in the car hundreds of times without contributing to gas. That seems like a one-sided arrangement. The author is covering all the costs\u2014fuel, time, maybe maintenance. The friend isn't contributing anything. Then there's one instance where the friend put $10 in gas when asked back for the purse. \n\nThe key point is whether the author is justified in ending the rides. The author might feel that the friend is taking advantage of their generosity. If the author had a prior agreement that the friend would pay for gas, then not doing so every time could be an issue. But if there was no such agreement, the author is under no obligation to provide free rides. \n\nThe user's friend put gas once, which is a small gesture, but not consistent with the hundreds of times before. So the author is pointing out the inconsistency. The question is whether it's fair to stop the rides because of that. \n\nI think the author is within their rights to set boundaries. They could have asked the friend to contribute to gas costs from the start, but since they didn't, they can't expect the friend to start now. Ending the rides after so many free rides might be a way to enforce fairness. However, some might argue that the author should have communicated expectations earlier. But since they didn't, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for stopping it now. \n\nAlso, the friend might have a different perspective\u2014maybe they thought it was a social arrangement, not a financial one. But the author is covering significant costs. In terms of fairness, the author isn't obligated to keep providing free rides without any contribution. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
