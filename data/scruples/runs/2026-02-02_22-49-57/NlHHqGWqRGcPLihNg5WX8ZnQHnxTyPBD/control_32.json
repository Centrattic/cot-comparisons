      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the friend often rides in their car without contributing to gas money. The writer mentions that the friend put $10 in gas this time after they forgot their purse, but the friend had done this hundreds of times before. The writer then told the friend to find their own way around.\n\nFirst, I need to determine if the writer is in the wrong (A) or not (B). Let's break down the scenario. The friend has been using the writer's car frequently without contributing to gas costs. The writer is the one covering all the expenses, including filling up the tank. The friend only contributed $10 once after the writer forgot their purse, which seems like an exception rather than the norm. \n\nThe writer decided to stop giving rides after that, asking the friend to find another way. The main issue here is whether it's fair for the friend to ride for free so often without contributing. In many cases, people might agree that splitting gas costs or contributing when they ride is reasonable, especially if it's a regular thing. \n\nThe friend's action of putting $10 in once might be seen as a small gesture, but it doesn't compensate for the hundreds of times before. The writer is essentially saying that since the friend hasn't been contributing regularly, they should stop. It's about fairness and personal boundaries. The writer isn't in the wrong here because they're setting a boundary to prevent being taken advantage of. The friend's behavior could be seen as using the writer's resources without reciprocating, so the writer's decision to stop is justifiable. Therefore, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
