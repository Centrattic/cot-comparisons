      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the Reddit post is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the friend has been taking rides in their car hundreds of times without contributing to gas. Then, once the author forgot their purse and the friend put $10 in gas, the author says they should find their own way now. The question is whether the author is an asshole (ITA) or not.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The friend has been using the author's car for rides without paying for gas. That's a lot of free rides. The author might feel that this is unfair, especially if they're covering all the costs. Then, when the author forgot their purse and the friend paid $10, the author is now ending the rides. The friend's single act of paying might not be enough to justify the author's decision, especially since the friend has been using the car so much without contributing. \n\nBut wait, maybe the friend was just trying to be helpful by putting gas in once. The author might be frustrated because the majority of the time, the friend hasn't contributed. So when the author says that the friend should find their own way around, is that fair? The author is setting a boundary, which is understandable. They might feel that the friend has been taking advantage of their generosity. \n\nHowever, someone might argue that the author didn't ask for payment before, so the friend had no reason to contribute until now. The author's sudden change in policy could be seen as a bit harsh. On the other hand, the author is within their rights to set boundaries about who uses their resources. \n\nI think the key here is the consistency. The friend has been using the car without paying, and the author is finally saying no. The author isn't in the wrong because they are taking back their time and car usage. People have the right to decide who can use their property. The fact that the friend paid once doesn't mean they should continue to ride for free. The author's decision to stop the rides is reasonable given the history of free rides. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
