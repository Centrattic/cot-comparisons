      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about ending free rides for a friend in their car. The friend has used the car hundreds of times without contributing to gas, but once put in $10 when the author forgot their purse. Now the author is telling the friend to find their own way.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The friend regularly takes rides without paying for gas. The author covers all the costs\u2014filling up the tank, picking up and dropping off. The one time the friend did contribute was when the author had to return the purse, which the friend paid $10 for gas. The author is now ending the free rides and telling the friend to find their own way. The question is whether the author is an asshole for doing so.\n\nSo, from the author's perspective, they've been giving free rides consistently without any contribution. The friend only offered to help once, and then the author is cutting off the rides. The author might feel that their generosity is being taken for granted. The friend's argument could be that they've ridden hundreds of times without paying, but the author is just ending the rides now. The key here is whether the friend's single act of paying gas is a valid reason for the author to stop the rides. The author might argue that it's about principle\u2014if you're going to ride in my car, you should pay for gas. The friend might feel that the single instance was enough, especially since it was an exception when the author needed to return the purse.\n\nEthically, it's about mutual respect and fair play. The author has the right to set boundaries. If the author didn't want the friend to ride without paying, they should have set that rule from the start. However, by allowing it for so long, the author might have implicitly agreed to the arrangement. Now changing the rules could be seen as being inconsiderate, but the author might also feel that they've been giving too much without reciprocity.\n\nThe friend's action of paying $10 could be seen as a token effort, not a commitment to contributing. The author is now holding them accountable, which is fair if the author expects payment each time. However, the friend might not have been aware of this expectation until now. The author's frustration is justified if they've been covering all costs, but ending the rides abruptly after so many times could be seen as harsh. The key is whether the author communicated their expectations clearly. If they never mentioned the gas payment before, the friend might not have known it was expected. If the author did, then the friend is in the wrong for not contributing. But the author also has the right to stop the arrangement if they're not comfortable with the terms anymore.\n\nIn AITA posts, the community often looks at both sides. The author's side is about setting boundaries and fairness, while the friend's side is about sudden change after a long period of unspoken agreement. The author isn't in the wrong because they have the right to stop the rides, especially if they feel their generosity is being abused. The friend's reliance on free rides without contributing is the issue here. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
