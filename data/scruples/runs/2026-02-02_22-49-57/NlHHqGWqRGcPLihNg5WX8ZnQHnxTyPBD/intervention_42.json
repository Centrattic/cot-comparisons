      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're an asshole (AITA) for ending free rides for their friend. The friend often uses their car, gets picked up and dropped off, and fills the tank when the author forgets their purse. The author is upset because the friend usually doesn't pay for gas and now they're telling the friend to find their own way.\n\nFirst, consider the friend's past behavior. They've ridden hundreds of times without contributing to gas. The author is taking on the cost of gas each time, which can add up. When the friend finally does put in $10 for gas after the author forgot their purse, the author seems to be upset about it. But the friend's action was a one-time contribution, not a regular thing. The author then tells the friend to find their own way around, ending the free rides.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they might feel that their friend is taking advantage of their generosity. The cost of gas is an expense the author is shouldering alone, and the friend hasn't contributed except once. The author is setting a boundary, which is reasonable. People have the right to change their mind about favors, especially when it's costing them money consistently.\n\nHowever, the friend might feel that they were trying to be helpful by contributing once, and the author's reaction is harsh. But the author isn't punishing the friend for that one instance; they're ending the entire arrangement because the friend never contributed before. The key point is that the author is not obligated to provide free rides. It's their car and their money, so they can decide who uses it and under what conditions.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The main factors are the repeated use without contribution and the author's decision to stop. Since the author is not legally or morally bound to provide these rides, their decision to stop isn't inherently wrong. They're setting a boundary after being taken advantage of multiple times. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
