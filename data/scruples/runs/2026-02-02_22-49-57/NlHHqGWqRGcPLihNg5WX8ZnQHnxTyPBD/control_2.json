      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the friend has been taking rides in the author's car many times without contributing to gas, except once when the author forgot their purse and the friend put $10 in gas. The author then told the friend to find their own way in the future. The options are A (author is wrong) or B (not wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation from both sides. The author is the one providing the rides, which includes filling up the gas and picking up and dropping off the friend. The friend usually doesn't pay for gas but did once when the author forgot their purse. The author then ends the arrangement. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, they might feel that their friend isn't contributing to the costs of the rides. Even though the friend paid once, it's only $10 out of many times they've taken rides. The author could see this as unfair, especially if they're covering all the costs except that one instance. Ending the rides might be their way of setting a boundary.\n\nOn the friend's side, perhaps they see the rides as a convenience and didn't realize they were supposed to contribute. The fact that they paid once might have been a gesture of goodwill when the author forgot their purse, not a regular contribution. However, the friend has been using the service many times without contributing, which might make the author feel taken advantage of.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's common for people to chip in for gas when they're given rides, especially if it's a recurring thing. The friend's action of paying once might not be enough if the author expects regular contributions. The author's decision to end the rides could be seen as reasonable if they feel their time and money aren't being valued. \n\nThe key points here are whether the author had a right to expect some form of contribution from the friend. Since the friend didn't contribute except once, the author might be justified in ending the arrangement. However, it's also possible that the author could have discussed this earlier instead of ending it abruptly. But in this case, the author is asking if they're an asshole for doing so. \n\nConsidering that people often expect some reciprocity in such situations, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for setting a boundary. The fact that the friend only paid once and the author had to cover the rest might justify the author's decision. Therefore, the answer might be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
