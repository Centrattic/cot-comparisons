      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author often gives their friend free rides in their car. The friend just hops in and out, and the author handles the gas. But this time, the friend put $10 in gas because the author forgot their purse at home and asked the friend to return it. The author then said that the friend should find their own way around in the future. The friend hasn't contributed gas money before, so the author is ending the free rides.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around sharing expenses. Normally, if someone uses your car regularly, it's fair to expect them to contribute to the costs, like gas. But in this case, the friend has been using the car hundreds of times without paying. The author might feel it's unfair to cover all the gas expenses alone. However, when the friend did contribute this one time, the author ended the arrangement. That seems contradictory. Maybe the friend was trying to help by adding $10, but the author took it as an opportunity to cut off the rides entirely. \n\nIs it reasonable for the author to expect the friend to pay for gas? Maybe, but the friend had a history of not paying. So the author might have a valid point about the imbalance. But ending the rides after the friend made a one-time contribution might come off as harsh. The friend might have thought that adding $10 was a good gesture, and the author's response could be seen as disproportionate. \n\nAlso, the reason the friend added the $10 was because the author forgot their purse. Maybe the friend was trying to be helpful by returning the purse and adding gas money as a gesture. The author's reaction could be perceived as overreacting, especially if the friend didn't have the means to pay before. So, the author's decision might be seen as unfair because they're ending the rides after a single instance where the friend tried to contribute, while ignoring the prior times the friend didn't pay. \n\nOn the other hand, the author has the right to set boundaries. If they feel that their friend is taking advantage, they can decide to stop offering rides. But doing so in a way that seems to punish the friend for a one-time good deed might not be the best approach. The key here is whether the author's action is a reasonable response to the ongoing situation. If the author never asked for gas money before, and the friend suddenly started paying it, maybe the author is just enforcing a rule now. However, the timing and the reason for ending the rides might be problematic. \n\nIn summary, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because they are trying to address a recurring issue where the friend hasn't contributed. However, the way they handled it after the friend made a one-time contribution could be seen as unfair. So, the answer might be B (the author is not in the wrong), but there's nuance here. The author's action is about setting boundaries, but the method might be questionable. However, since the question is whether they are in the wrong, and the friend was using the car without paying before, the author is justified in stopping the rides, even if it seems abrupt.\n"
