      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who asked the question (AITA) is in the wrong for ending free rides. Let me read through the details again.\n\nThe situation is that the friend always gets free rides in the author's car. The author fills up the tank and picks up the friend, dropping him off. This past weekend, the friend put $10 in gas because the author forgot her purse at home and asked him back for it. The author is now telling the friend to find his own way around in the future. The question is whether the author is an asshole for ending the free rides.\n\nFirst, I should consider the key points. The friend has used the author's car hundreds of times without contributing to gas. The one time he did contribute $10 was because the author forgot her purse and asked him back. Now the author is ending the arrangement. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the friend hasn't been contributing to the gas costs except that one instance. The author is probably covering all the costs of gas, maintenance, and wear and tear on the car. It's reasonable for the author to feel that the friend is taking advantage of the situation. \n\nThe friend's action of putting $10 in gas was a one-time thing, not a regular contribution. The author might feel that even that small amount wasn't consistent with the usual pattern. By ending the rides, the author is setting a boundary, which is her right. She's not obligated to provide transportation for her friend without any contribution. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the friend is just trying to help out in that one instance, and the author is being too harsh. But considering the context of hundreds of free rides, the author's decision to end it seems justified. The friend should have been contributing more regularly if he wanted to use the car regularly. \n\nSo, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong) because she's setting a boundary after being taken advantage of. The friend's behavior was more parasitic, and the author is correcting that by ending the arrangement.\n"
