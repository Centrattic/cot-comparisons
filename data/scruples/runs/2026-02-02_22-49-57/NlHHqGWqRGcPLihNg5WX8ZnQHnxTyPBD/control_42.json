      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" question is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the friend always gets rides in the author's car, fills up the tank, picks them up and drops them off safely. This past weekend, the friend put $10 in gas because the author forgot their purse at home. The friend then asked the author back for it. The author is now saying, \"Find your way around in the future.\" So, the question is whether the author is an asshole for ending the free rides.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author has been providing a service (rides) without compensation, and the friend has done so without contributing. The friend's one-time contribution of $10 for gas when the author forgot their purse might be seen as a minor gesture, but the author is ending the arrangement. \n\nThe key points here are: the friend has used the author's car hundreds of times without contributing, except once. The author is now ending the rides, possibly because the friend didn't consistently pay. The author's reasoning is that the friend should find their own way around now. \n\nI need to think about fairness. Has the friend been unfair? They took advantage of the author's generosity without contributing, except once. The author might feel it's unfair to continue giving rides without any contribution from the friend, especially since the friend didn't make an effort to chip in before. The author's response could be seen as setting a boundary. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the friend did contribute that one time, but maybe it was an exception. The author might have expected the friend to start contributing consistently. However, the friend might not have realized that the author wanted them to pay for gas. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the person acted inconsiderately or without cause. The author's action seems to be setting a boundary after the friend didn't contribute before, except once. The author is not being unreasonable here. They are saying that if the friend wants rides, they need to pay. The author isn't wrong for expecting some contribution, especially since the cost adds up over time with hundreds of rides. \n\nSo, the author is probably not in the wrong. The answer would be B (No), because the author is setting a boundary and the friend had not consistently contributed to the cost of the rides. The one-time $10 contribution isn't enough to change the pattern of free rides. The author's decision is reasonable.\n"
