      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the Reddit-style post) is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the friend has taken rides in their car hundreds of times without contributing to gas, and when the author forgot their purse, the friend put $10 in gas. Then, the author told the friend to find their own way around.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations. The friend has been a regular rider, but never contributed before. The author might feel taken advantage of, especially after so many free rides. When the friend finally contributed $10, maybe the author felt it wasn't enough, leading them to end the arrangement. \n\nBut the key point here is that the friend did contribute once, albeit after being prompted indirectly by the author forgetting their purse. The author then decided to stop giving rides. Is that fair? Well, the author isn't obligated to provide rides, and it's their car and money. They can set boundaries whenever they want. The friend didn't have a prior agreement to pay for gas, so the author isn't wrong for changing the terms. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the author is being abrupt because the friend had only contributed once before. But the author's right to their own car and fuel isn't in question. People can choose who they ride with and under what conditions. The friend's occasional contribution doesn't negate the author's right to stop. \n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They're setting a boundary after feeling exploited. The answer should be B (No).\n"
