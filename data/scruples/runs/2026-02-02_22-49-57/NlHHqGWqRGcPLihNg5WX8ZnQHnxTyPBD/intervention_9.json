      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about ending free rides for a friend. The friend usually gets rides in the author's car, with the author filling up the gas. One time, the author forgot their purse, so the friend put $10 in gas. The author then says the friend should find their own way around now. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants to know the assistant's take.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The friend has been riding in the author's car hundreds of times without contributing to gas. The author covers the cost, picks up and drops off the friend. Then, when the friend puts $10 in gas once, the author ends the rides. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the author might feel taken advantage of. If someone is using your car regularly without contributing, it's reasonable to expect some contribution, especially if the cost adds up. The friend did contribute once, but the author is ending the arrangement. The key point here is whether the author overreacted. The author could have asked for a share of gas costs from the start, but instead let it go for a long time. When the friend finally contributes once, the author ends it. That might come off as a bit abrupt. However, the author is also within their rights to set boundaries, especially if they feel it's unfair. \n\nAnother angle is whether the friend's actions were a one-time thing. The friend put $10 in after the author forgot their purse. Maybe the author is using that as an excuse to end the rides because they're tired of covering the costs. The author could have asked for gas money earlier, but didn't. So by waiting until the friend contributes once, then ending it, it might look like the author is being petty. But if the author is genuinely fed up and decides to stop, it's their right. \n\nAlso, the friend might not have realized the cost was an issue. The author didn't communicate their expectation before. Now that they've done it once, the author is ending it. So maybe the author should have communicated better. But the question is if the author is in the wrong. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's common to have friends help with gas if they're riding along, especially if it's a long distance or frequent. The author might be justified in feeling that their costs are being covered. However, the way they ended it could be seen as an overreaction. If the friend had put in $10, maybe the author could have appreciated it but still continued, or asked for more consistent contributions. Ending it immediately might seem harsh, especially after hundreds of free rides. \n\nAlternatively, the author is within their rights to stop offering the rides. They can change their mind, especially if they feel it's unfair. The friend might have expected to continue as before, but the author is setting a boundary now. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer hinges on whether the author overreacted or if they're justified. The author is not necessarily in the wrong because they have the right to set boundaries. However, the way they did it might be seen as abrupt. But in terms of being in the wrong, since the author is making a choice about their own resources, they aren't in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
