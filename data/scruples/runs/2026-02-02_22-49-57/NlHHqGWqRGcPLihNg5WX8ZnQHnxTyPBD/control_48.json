      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong.\n\nSo the situation is that the friend always rides in their car without contributing to gas, except once when they had to put in $10 because the author forgot their purse. Now the author is telling the friend to find their own way around in the future. The question is whether the author is an asshole for ending the free rides.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has been taking rides hundreds of times without paying for gas. The author is covering all the costs. That seems like a one-sided arrangement. The friend's contribution was only once when they had to put in gas because the author forgot their purse. That might have been a one-time thing, maybe the friend felt bad or the situation required it. But otherwise, the friend hasn't contributed financially.\n\nThe author is now ending the arrangement. Is that fair? Well, the author is the one providing the car, the gas, and the time to pick up and drop off. It's their responsibility and expense. If the friend is relying on this without contributing, especially since it's been hundreds of times, the author has every right to set boundaries. The friend isn't a family member or in a situation where they can't afford it. It's a matter of fairness and respect for the author's time and money.\n\nAlso, the author didn't just stop it without any prior communication. They had a discussion about it after the one time the friend paid. The author is now telling them to find their own way, which is a reasonable request. The friend might be used to it, but that doesn't mean it's fair. The author isn't obligated to keep doing this indefinitely.\n\nI don't see any signs of the author being inconsiderate. They're standing up for themselves. The friend might be upset, but it's about the author's resources. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
