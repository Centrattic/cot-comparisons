      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (AITA) is wrong for ending free rides. The friend used to ride with the author a lot without contributing to gas. This time, the author forgot their purse at home, and the friend put $10 in gas when they returned it. The author then said the friend should find their own way around in the future.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the situation from both sides. The author has been giving free rides hundreds of times. The friend put gas once, but the author is ending the rides entirely. The question is about whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nThe key points are: the author provided rides without asking for anything in return, the friend didn't contribute before, but this time they did. However, the author's response is to stop all rides. Maybe the author feels taken advantage of. The friend's action of putting gas might be a one-time thing, not a regular contribution. The author is setting a boundary, which is their right. But was the friend's action enough to justify ending all rides?\n\nIn typical AITA scenarios, people often expect reciprocity or some form of contribution if it's a favor done repeatedly. The author might feel that the friend never contributed before, and even a small contribution now isn't enough. The friend might feel that since they put gas once, it's unfair to cut them off entirely. But the author has the right to set boundaries. The author isn't obligated to keep offering free rides if they don't want to. So, the answer would be B (Not in the wrong). The friend's one-time gesture doesn't negate the prior lack of contribution, and the author is within their rights to stop the rides if they feel it's a one-sided arrangement now.\n"
