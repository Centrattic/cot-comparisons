      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the friend usually gets rides without contributing, but once put in $10 for gas when the author forgot their purse. Then the author told the friend to find their own way. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants confirmation.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key points are: the friend has ridden hundreds of times without contributing, except once. The author is ending the free rides, asking the friend to find their own way. The user is considering if that's justified.\n\nThe author's action is about setting boundaries. The friend's behavior might be seen as taking advantage, especially since they contributed only once. The author might feel that the friend isn't considering the cost or the effort involved in giving rides. The friend's one-time contribution might not be enough to justify the continued rides.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have addressed it earlier instead of ending it abruptly. But the friend never offered to contribute before, so the author could feel that the one-time payment isn't sufficient. The author's decision might be reasonable as they're asserting their right to set limits on how their resources (like gas) are used.\n\nConsidering societal norms, friends often help each other, but it's also okay to expect some reciprocity. The author isn't being unreasonable by asking for fairness. The friend's lack of consistent contribution could make the author's decision justified. So the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
