      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the friend regularly uses their car for rides, and this time, when the author forgot their purse, the friend put in $10 for gas. The author then told the friend to find their own way around in the future. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants to know my take.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The friend has been using the car many times without contributing to gas. This time, the friend did put in $10, but maybe the author expected more? Or maybe the author is frustrated with the ongoing situation and decided to draw a line. The key points are the friend's previous behavior versus this one instance of contributing. \n\nGas money isn't usually something that's expected to be split unless agreed upon in advance. If the author never asked for contributions before, the friend probably thought it was okay. But when the author finally asks or implies that contributions should be made, the friend steps up with $10. However, the author's response is to cut off rides entirely. That could be seen as overreacting if the friend had a one-time contribution. On the other hand, maybe the author is tired of the friend's constant free rides and used this as an excuse to end it. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the author never had a prior agreement about gas contributions, then the friend wasn't in the wrong for not paying before. But when the author brings it up, the friend tries to make a contribution. If the author is now cutting off rides because of this one instance, maybe they're being unfair. Alternatively, if the author is frustrated and decided to enforce a rule retroactively, that might be the issue. \n\nAnother angle: Did the author communicate their expectation for gas contributions before? If not, the friend isn't at fault for not contributing before. The author might be in the wrong if they're suddenly enforcing a new rule after years of free rides. But if the author had been hinting or the friend should have known, maybe not. \n\nAlso, the friend put in $10. Depending on the gas price and the distance traveled, $10 might be a small amount compared to the total cost. But the author might feel that since the friend never contributed before, this one time isn't enough. However, cutting off all future rides seems harsh. \n\nIn AITA posts, the community often looks at whether there was prior communication. If the author never mentioned contributing to gas before, the friend isn't in the wrong. The author might be in the wrong for ending the rides without clear communication. Alternatively, if the author felt it was unfair that the friend never paid, then maybe the author had the right to set boundaries. But ending all future rides just because the friend contributed once could be seen as overreacting. \n\nI think the author's main issue is with the friend not contributing in the past, and this incident was the straw that broke the camel's back. By saying the friend should find their own way, the author is ending the arrangement. The question is whether ending it without prior discussion makes them an asshole. \n\nIn terms of social norms, people usually communicate their expectations. If the author wanted the friend to contribute, they should have discussed it earlier. Now, using a past incident to end the ride might be seen as holding a grudge or setting a boundary too late. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer might be that the author is not in the wrong because they have a right to set boundaries, but if they didn't communicate it before, maybe they are. But the friend didn't contribute before, so the author is justified in not continuing the ride. Hmm. It's a bit of a gray area. \n\nIn AITA communities, people often side with the person who is setting boundaries, especially if the other person was freeloading. So maybe the answer is B, the author isn't in the wrong. But if the author didn't communicate expectations, maybe they are. Wait, the author didn't mention any prior communication. So if the friend had no idea that contributions were expected, the author's sudden enforcement could be seen as unfair. But the author is also within their rights to stop. \n\nThis is tricky. I think the key is whether the author communicated the expectation. If not, then the friend isn't at fault. The author is ending it without prior discussion, which might be the issue. But the friend did contribute once, which the author might have appreciated. However, the author's response seems to be about past behavior. \n\nI think the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong because they have the right to stop offering rides if they're unhappy with the friend's previous behavior. Even if they didn't communicate it before, they can decide to change the terms. So the author isn't an asshole.\n"
