      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about ending free rides for a friend. The friend usually rides with them, pays gas sometimes, but the author is ending it after the friend only put $10 in gas once when the author forgot their purse. The author is asking if they're an asshole for telling the friend to find their own way around now.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The friend has used the car for hundreds of times without contributing to gas, except once when they put $10. The author is upset about that. The question is if ending the free rides makes them the asshole.\n\nSo, from a fairness perspective, if the friend usually doesn't help with gas, but one time did, maybe the author is being inconsistent. But the main point is whether the author is in the wrong for ending the rides. The author feels that the friend didn't contribute to gas before, and even when they did, the amount was low. The friend might have assumed it was free, but the author is tired of covering the costs.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often feel entitled to something they've been given for free, but when the person providing it sets boundaries, they're not usually considered in the wrong. The author is setting a boundary after being taken advantage of, so they're not in the wrong. The answer is B.\n"
