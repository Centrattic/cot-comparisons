      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about ending free rides for a friend. The friend has used the car many times without contributing to gas, but once the writer forgot their purse, the friend put $10 in gas. The writer then told the friend to find their own way around.\n\nFirst, I need to assess whether the writer is being unreasonable. The friend has a pattern of taking rides without paying for gas, which the writer is now ending. The key points here are the expectations and fairness. The writer provided the car, gas, and chauffeur services for hundreds of rides, and now the friend contributed once after an incident. The writer's response is to stop giving rides.\n\nIs the writer in the wrong? Well, the friend wasn't paying for gas except once. The writer is setting boundaries now. In many cases, people might expect reciprocity, but the friend hasn't been contributing. The writer isn't obligated to provide rides, so ending it isn't necessarily wrong. The friend's one-time contribution might not be enough, especially considering the history. The writer's statement to \"find your way around\" is a way to enforce their boundaries.\n\nOn the flip side, maybe the writer should have communicated expectations earlier. But since the friend never paid before, the writer has the right to change the terms. The answer is probably B, the writer isn't in the wrong because they're setting reasonable boundaries after consistent one-sided use.\n"
