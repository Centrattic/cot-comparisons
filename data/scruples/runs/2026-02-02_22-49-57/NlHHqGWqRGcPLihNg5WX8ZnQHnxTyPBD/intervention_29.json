      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the friend often rides in their car, and the author fills up the gas tank and picks them up. The friend only put gas in once when the author forgot their purse and had to come back. The author now told the friend to find their own way around. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong but wants to know if that's the case.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the dynamics here. The friend has been using the author's car for rides hundreds of times without contributing gas. Then, once, when the author forgot their purse, the friend put in $10 for gas. The author then decided to stop giving rides. The key points are the expectation of reciprocity and the one-time contribution.\n\nIn many friendships, there's an unspoken agreement about mutual help. If the friend is consistently using the author's resources (gas, time) without contributing, that can be seen as one-sided. The friend's one-time contribution might not be enough to balance the hundreds of times they've ridden for free. The author's decision to stop could be seen as enforcing boundaries, which is reasonable because the friend hasn't been contributing fairly.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author should have been more upfront about expecting gas money from the start. If the author never mentioned it, the friend might not have known that contributing was expected. But in this case, the author has let it go for so long, and the friend only contributed once. The author might feel that after so many free rides, the one-time contribution isn't sufficient. \n\nThe author's response of asking the friend to find their own way is a clear boundary. The question is whether that's justified. Since the friend hasn't been contributing gas money except once, the author is within their rights to stop providing a service that's costing them. The answer likely hinges on whether the friend's contribution was adequate. Since the friend only put in $10 for gas once, and the author has given hundreds of rides, the imbalance is significant. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong for setting that boundary. The answer would be B, No.\n"
