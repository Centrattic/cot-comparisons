      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the friend has used the author's car many times without contributing to gas, but once put in $10 when the author forgot their purse. Now the author is telling the friend to find their own way around.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend has been riding for hundreds of times without paying gas. That's a lot of free rides. The user might be thinking that the friend isn't contributing, which could be unfair. The author might feel taken advantage of. \n\nThen, there's the instance where the friend put $10 in gas. The author forgot their purse, so the friend covered it. But the author is now ending the rides. The question is whether that's justified. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, maybe they feel the friend hasn't contributed enough. But the friend might feel that the $10 was a one-time thing, and the author is being unfair. However, since the author is setting boundaries now, is that reasonable?\n\nI think the key here is whether the friend was expected to pay for gas. If there was an unspoken agreement that the author would cover gas, then the friend might not be in the wrong. But if the author was covering gas as a favor, then it's their car and they can set the rules. \n\nThe author is asking if they're an asshole for ending the rides. The friend might have relied on these rides, so suddenly cutting them off could be inconvenient. However, the author has a right to their own transportation. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the friend did contribute once, but that's not consistent. The author might feel it's time to stop the free rides. So overall, the author isn't in the wrong for setting that boundary. The answer should be B.\n"
