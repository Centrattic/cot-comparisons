      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The friend usually gets rides in their car, and this time the friend put 10 in gas because the author forgot their purse. The author then told the friend to find their own way.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The friend has been getting rides hundreds of times without contributing to gas before. This time, the friend put in $10 for gas when asked to return the purse. The author is now saying the friend should find their own way. The question is whether the author is an asshole (AITA) for ending the free rides.\n\nSo, the key points here are about fairness and expectations. The friend never contributed before, so when they suddenly did once, the author might be reacting to that inconsistency. But the author is ending the free rides entirely. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants to know if the author is in the wrong.\n\nI need to consider both sides. The friend might feel they were helping by contributing once, but the author is setting a boundary now. The author has the right to decide who uses their car and under what terms. However, the author's response might be seen as harsh because the friend's one-time contribution could be a step towards mutual responsibility. But the author might feel that after hundreds of free rides, one small contribution isn't enough, and they want to set a boundary for future accountability.\n\nIs the author in the wrong? If the author is ending the rides because they want the friend to contribute more consistently, then maybe not. But if they're being petty because the friend contributed once, maybe so. The author's decision is about controlling their own resources, which is their right. However, the way they reacted might be abrupt. Maybe a better approach would be to discuss contributing to gas more regularly instead of cutting off rides entirely.\n\nIn terms of the AITA framework, people usually consider if the person acted unreasonably. The author's action is about setting boundaries, which is reasonable. But the friend's past behavior might imply an unspoken agreement. The author is changing the terms, which is their right, but they should communicate that clearly. The friend might have expected a different response given the one-time contribution.\n\nSo, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for deciding to stop free rides, but maybe the execution could be better. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, the answer would lean towards B (No) because they are within their rights to set boundaries, even if it's sudden.\n"
