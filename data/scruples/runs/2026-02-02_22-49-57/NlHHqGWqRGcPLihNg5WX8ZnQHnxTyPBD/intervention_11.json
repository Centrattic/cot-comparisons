      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about ending free rides for a friend who's used the author's car many times without contributing to gas. Now, the friend put $10 in gas once when the author forgot their purse, but the author is ending the rides. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author has been giving rides regularly, and the friend never paid for gas before. The one time the friend contributed was an exception. The author is now saying the friend should find their own way around. \n\nI should consider the social norms here. Usually, if someone is giving regular rides and the passenger never contributes, it's a one-sided arrangement. The author might feel it's unfair, especially if they're covering all costs. The friend's action of putting gas money once might not be enough to balance the long-term use. \n\nBut maybe the friend thought they were being kind by contributing once. However, the author has been doing this for hundreds of times without payment. The question is whether the author has the right to end the rides. The key here is mutual respect and fairness. If the author feels taken advantage of, it's reasonable to set boundaries. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have communicated their feelings earlier instead of ending it abruptly. But the user's question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the friend didn't contribute most of the time, the author isn't being unfair by ending it. The friend's single act of giving $10 isn't enough to justify continued free rides. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to set boundaries, especially when the arrangement has been one-sided. The friend should have contributed more consistently, but since they didn't, the author is justified in stopping the rides.\n"
