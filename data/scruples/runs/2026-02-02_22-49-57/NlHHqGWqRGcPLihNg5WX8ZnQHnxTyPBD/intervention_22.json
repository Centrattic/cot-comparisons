      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for ending free rides to their friend. So, the scenario is that the friend has been taking rides in the author's car hundreds of times without contributing to the gas, except once when they put in $10. Now the author is telling the friend to find their own way around. The user thinks the author isn't wrong but wants a second opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has been providing a service (transportation) without expecting payment, but the friend only contributed once. However, the author is now asking the friend to stop using their car, which could be seen as a shift in expectations. The key points here are the frequency of the rides, the one-time contribution, and the author's decision to end the rides.\n\nIn terms of fairness, if someone uses another's resources repeatedly without contributing, it's reasonable for the provider to set boundaries. The friend's one-time $10 might not cover the cost of hundreds of rides. The author is asserting their right to control their car and not have it used as a free service. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the friend's occasional contribution (even if it's not enough) shows some effort. But the main issue is the author's right to decide how their car is used. Since the author is not obligated to offer rides, they can choose to stop whenever they want. The friend's past behavior of not contributing beyond that one time could be seen as taking advantage, which justifies the author's stance. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong because they have the right to set boundaries regarding their personal property. The friend's continued use without fair contribution is the issue here, not the author's decision to stop providing the service.\n"
