      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about a friend who regularly rides in the author's car without contributing to gas costs. This time, the friend put $10 in gas when the author forgot their purse, but the author is now telling the friend to find their own way around. The options are A (Yes, the author is wrong) or B (No, they're not).\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the context. The friend has used the car hundreds of times without paying for gas. The author is a regular driver, providing rides, and the friend is essentially freeloading. The friend's action this time\u2014adding $10 in gas\u2014was an exception. The author is upset that the friend didn't do this before and is now cutting off the rides.\n\nThe core issue is fairness. The author is upset that the friend didn't contribute before and is now setting boundaries. The friend's $10 was likely a fix after realizing the author might be out of money. However, the author is now deciding to stop providing rides, which might be seen as a reasonable response to the friend's past behavior. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the author has the right to set boundaries. The friend's past actions (not contributing to gas) might be seen as taking advantage. The author isn't obligated to provide rides without compensation. However, some might argue that the friend made a good gesture this time, and the author is overreacting by cutting off all future rides. \n\nBut considering the context of multiple instances, the author's response is about enforcing a boundary after repeated freeloading. The friend's one-time contribution isn't enough to make up for past actions. So the author isn't in the wrong for setting that boundary. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
