      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about ending free rides for a friend. The friend has been taking rides in the author's car many times without contributing to gas. This time, the friend put $10 in gas when the author forgot her purse, and then asked for it back. The author then decided to tell the friend to find their own way around.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has been a regular rider without paying for gas. Gas costs are the author's expense, and the friend hasn't contributed before. The one time they did put $10 in, the friend asked for it back. That seems a bit odd because if they were paying for gas, they wouldn't expect to get it back. Maybe the friend thought it was a loan? \n\nThe author's main point is that they're ending the rides because the friend hasn't paid before, and this instance is an exception. The question is whether the author is in the wrong by setting this boundary. \n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, it's reasonable for the author to expect some contribution to gas, especially if they're doing this frequently. The friend's behavior of not paying before might have been taken for granted. The author is essentially saying that since the friend hasn't paid in the past, they won't continue providing the service. \n\nHowever, maybe the friend didn't realize it was an issue. The author could have addressed it earlier instead of waiting until now. But the key here is that the author is asserting their right to stop the rides, which is their choice. Unless there was an explicit agreement that the friend would pay for gas, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for changing their mind. \n\nAlso, the friend's request to get the $10 back might indicate they didn't intend to pay for gas, which complicates the situation. The author might feel that since the friend is now asking for the money back, it's a sign they don't want to contribute. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's common for friends to ride together without paying, but there's no rule that says it's mandatory. The author is within their rights to set boundaries. The friend might need to adjust their expectations or perhaps find another way to contribute if they still want rides. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They're taking control of their resources and setting a boundary. The friend might be at fault for not contributing before, but the author's decision to stop the rides is a reasonable response.\n"
