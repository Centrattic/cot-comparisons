      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who ended free rides for their friend is in the wrong. The scenario is that the friend always rides with them, and now, after one instance of contributing $10 to gas, the friend is being told to find their own way. The friend has done this hundreds of times without paying before.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has been given free rides repeatedly. The situation where they contributed gas money was an exception, and the user is now asking if it's wrong to stop providing the rides. The friend might feel they're being treated unfairly now, especially since they only contributed once.\n\nFrom the user's perspective, they might feel that since the friend never paid before, this one-time payment isn't enough. They might feel like they're being taken advantage of and want to set boundaries. The user's response was to tell the friend to find their own way, which could be seen as standing up for themselves.\n\nHowever, the friend's reaction isn't mentioned, but the question is whether the user is wrong. If the user is comfortable with ending the rides, and the friend had the choice to contribute or not before, then the user isn't necessarily in the wrong. They're setting a boundary after a pattern of one-sided behavior. \n\nBut maybe the user should have communicated earlier about the gas costs. If the user never mentioned it before, the friend might not realize that it's a burden. In that case, ending it now could be abrupt. However, since the friend only contributed once and the user is ending it, it's a way to enforce a new rule. \n\nSo, considering that the friend had free rides for a long time, and the user is now setting a boundary, the user isn't in the wrong. The key points are the pattern of behavior and the user's right to set limits. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
