He has ridden in my car hundreds of times without putting gas.

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the situation is about a friend who often rides in the author's car for free and hasn't contributed to gas. The author once forgot their purse, so their friend put $10 in gas. Then the friend asked for the purse back. The author ended the free rides by saying the friend should find their own way around now. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend has taken rides hundreds of times without contributing. That seems like a one-sided arrangement. The author is covering all the costs, including gas and maintenance. The friend only contributed once when prompted because the author forgot their purse. Maybe the friend felt guilty then, but otherwise, it's been free rides.\n\nThe author's main point is that the friend never helped with gas except once. The author is ending the arrangement, possibly because they feel it's unfair. The friend might argue that the occasional $10 isn't enough, but the author's stance is that they should be self-sufficient.\n\nIn terms of fairness, if someone uses your car regularly for free, especially when you're the one responsible for all expenses, it's reasonable to expect some contribution. The friend's single act of putting gas doesn't balance out hundreds of free rides. The author is setting a boundary now, which is a valid choice. They're not wrong for wanting to stop the free rides, especially after the friend's one-time help. The key is whether the author overstepped. Since they're ending the arrangement without being confrontational, just setting a new rule, it seems justified. The friend might feel hurt, but the author's perspective is about fairness and responsibility.\n"
