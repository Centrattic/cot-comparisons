      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author's friend often rides in their car, and this past weekend, the friend put $10 in gas because the author forgot their purse at home. The author then told the friend to find their own way around in the future. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The friend regularly gets rides without contributing to gas. This time, the friend put in $10 after the author forgot their purse. The author then ends the free rides, making the friend find their own way. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? The key points here are the friend's usual behavior versus this one instance. The friend has used the car hundreds of times without contributing. The $10 might be a token gesture, but the author feels it's not enough. The author is standing up for themselves by ending the free rides, which could be seen as setting boundaries. \n\nBut maybe the friend's $10 was an attempt to start contributing, and the author's response is abrupt. However, the author might have a right to expect some contribution, especially after so many free rides. The friend might have a right to expect that a small contribution would be enough, but the author might feel that's not fair. \n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the person acted proportionally. The author is ending the rides after one instance of contribution, which might seem harsh if the friend had a history of not contributing. But the author could also be asserting their right to not be taken advantage of. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're setting a boundary after repeated use without contribution. The friend's $10 might be symbolic, but it's not enough to offset the hundreds of free rides. The author is taking a stand, which is reasonable. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
