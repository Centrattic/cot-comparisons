      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. So the user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for ending their friend's free rides.\n\nThe situation is that the friend has been taking rides in the author's car hundreds of times without contributing to gas. This time, the friend put $10 into gas because the author forgot their purse and needed the money back. The author then told the friend to find their own way around in the future.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations in a friendship. Typically, sharing a ride occasionally might be seen as a favor, but if someone is doing it repeatedly without contributing, it might become a problem. The friend here has been doing it hundreds of times, which seems pretty habitual. The author is now cutting it off, which the friend might find inconvenient, but maybe the author is justified because of the repeated one-sidedness.\n\nThen there's the part where the friend did contribute $10 once. But that's just one instance out of hundreds. The author might feel that this is not enough to make up for the regular use of their car. The friend might not understand the financial impact over time, like the cost of gas, wear and tear on the car, etc.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong for stopping this. If the friend didn't ask for the rides and the author is now setting a boundary, that's reasonable. The fact that the author is the one who has to provide the car and gas each time suggests that the responsibility is on them. The friend's occasional contribution doesn't offset the regular use. So the author isn't being unreasonable by ending it.\n\nBut maybe someone could argue that since the friend did contribute once, the author should have been more understanding. However, the key point is that the friend's contribution was minimal compared to the frequency. The author is entitled to set boundaries, especially if they feel taken advantage of. So the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
