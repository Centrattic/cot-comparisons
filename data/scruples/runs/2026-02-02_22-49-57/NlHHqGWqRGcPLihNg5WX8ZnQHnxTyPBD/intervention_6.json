      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong after ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the friend often rides in their car, and the author fills up the gas, picks them up, and drops them off. This past weekend, the friend added $10 to the gas because the author forgot their purse at home and asked the friend back for it. Now the author is saying they should find their own way around, and the user is wondering if the author is wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author has been providing a regular service (rides) without charging, and the friend has taken advantage of this many times. The friend's one-time contribution of $10 for gas is a small gesture compared to the hundreds of times they've used the author's car. The author is now setting a boundary, which the friend might see as unfair because they contributed once. But the author could argue that the friend didn't contribute most of the time and now expects continued free rides.\n\nThe key points here are about reciprocity and expectations. The author might feel that the friend isn't sharing the cost, especially since the friend benefits from the rides. By asking the friend to find their own way, the author is asserting that they can't keep covering the costs indefinitely. The friend's one-time $10 contribution might not be enough in the author's eyes, especially if the friend hasn't done it before.\n\nAnother angle is the initial request. The friend added $10 because the author forgot their purse. That might have been a specific reason, but the author might have expected the friend to take responsibility for future rides. However, the friend might have thought that one time was sufficient. \n\nBut the author is setting a boundary, which is a valid action. It's their car and their money. The friend hasn't contributed consistently, so the author is within their rights to stop the rides. The friend might be upset, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for enforcing that boundary.\n\nSo considering all this, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
