      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author's friend has been riding in their car all the time, and the author usually fills up the gas. This time, the friend put $10 in gas because the author forgot their purse. Then the author told the friend to find their own way around in the future. The question is whether the author is an asshole for ending the free rides.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. The friend has ridden in the car hundreds of times without contributing to gas. The author is the one who fills up the tank, picks up the friend, and drops them off. So, the author is clearly shouldering the cost and responsibility of the rides. The friend only contributed once when the author forgot their purse. That seems like a minor instance. \n\nNow, the author is ending the rides. The friend might feel that they've been using the author's resources without contributing, but the author is asserting their right to stop. The key here is whether the author's action is reasonable. The friend hasn't been contributing to the cost of the rides, which is a valid point. The author is justified in deciding to stop if they feel it's unfair. \n\nBut maybe there's an unspoken agreement where the friend expects rides in exchange for other things, like emotional support or companionship. However, the author isn't mentioned as being compensated in any other way. The friend's one-time contribution of gas doesn't seem to make up for the hundreds of times they didn't contribute. \n\nAnother angle: the author might be frustrated with the friend's lack of consideration for their expenses. It's reasonable for someone to set boundaries, especially when someone else is using their resources repeatedly without contributing. The author's request to \"find your way around\" is a clear boundary, which is their right. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author isn't in the wrong. They've been covering all the costs, and the friend hasn't reciprocated. The author is within their rights to stop offering the rides if they feel it's unfair. The friend might have taken it for granted, but the author is not an asshole for standing up for themselves.\n"
