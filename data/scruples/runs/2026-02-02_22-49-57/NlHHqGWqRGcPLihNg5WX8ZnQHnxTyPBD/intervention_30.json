      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The friend has taken rides hundreds of times without contributing to gas, but this time, when the author forgot their purse, the friend put $10 in gas as a gesture. Then the author said the friend should find their own way around in the future.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The friend regularly uses the author's car without paying for gas. The author is covering all the costs, including filling up the tank and providing rides. The friend's action of putting $10 in gas was a one-time gesture, perhaps to show appreciation when the author forgot their purse. The author then decides to stop offering rides, expecting the friend to arrange their own transportation.\n\nThe key points here are about fairness and expectations. If the author never expected the friend to contribute to gas costs before, and the friend didn't, is it the author's fault to suddenly enforce a change? The friend might feel that since it was a one-time contribution, the author is now being unfair by cutting off rides entirely. But the author might feel that after so many free rides, it's reasonable to expect some contribution, especially when the friend finally did something. \n\nHowever, the friend's $10 contribution might not even cover the actual cost of the gas used for those rides. If the author is now asking for payment for all the past rides, that's a different scenario. But the author's statement is about the future\u2014saying the friend should find their own way. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't, but wants confirmation. The author's reasoning is that the friend has never paid before, so expecting future payment now is fair. The friend might argue that the $10 was a token, and the author is now taking it as a sign to stop rides. \n\nI think the author has the right to set boundaries. If the friend never paid before, the author can decide that future rides require some contribution. The friend's one-time payment might not be sufficient, but the author doesn't owe an explanation. The friend should have paid for the rides from the start, so the author's request is just making that expectation clear now. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
