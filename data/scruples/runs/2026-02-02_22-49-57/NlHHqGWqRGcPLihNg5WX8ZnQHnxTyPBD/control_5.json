      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about ending free rides for their friend. The friend has been riding in their car hundreds of times without contributing to gas, and when the author forgot their purse, the friend put $10 in gas. Now the author said the friend should find their own way around. The options are A for yes (author is in the wrong) or B for no (not in the wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is providing rides regularly, which includes picking up the friend and dropping them off, which is a convenience. The friend never contributed before but did once when the author forgot their purse. The author is now ending the rides, and the friend is upset. \n\nThe key points here are expectations and fairness. The author might feel that since the friend didn't contribute before, they should chip in now, but the friend might feel they did a one-time gesture and the author is being unfair. However, the author has the right to set boundaries about their own car and expenses. They aren't obligated to provide rides, especially if it's causing them financial or time burdens. \n\nThe friend's actions in the past were free rides, and the $10 was a one-off. The author is now ending the arrangement, which is their choice. The friend might be in the wrong for not contributing before, but the author isn't obligated to offer rides without compensation. So the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for ending the rides. \n\nI think the answer is B. The author isn't in the wrong because they can decide who uses their car and under what conditions. The friend's previous lack of contribution is a point, but the author is setting a boundary now.\n"
