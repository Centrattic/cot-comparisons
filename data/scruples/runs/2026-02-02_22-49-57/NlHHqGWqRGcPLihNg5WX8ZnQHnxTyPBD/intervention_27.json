      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for ending free friend rides. The author's friend has been using their car regularly without contributing to gas, except once when they put in $10 because the author forgot their purse. The author now says the friend should find their own way around.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the situation. The friend has been riding with the author hundreds of times without paying for gas. The one time they did contribute was a specific instance where the author forgot their purse. The author is now cutting off the rides, and the question is if that makes them an asshole.\n\nIn many cultures, splitting gas costs when giving someone a ride is common, especially if it's a regular thing. If the friend never offered to help with gas before, that could be seen as taking advantage. The author might feel that their friend isn't considering the cost, and after so many rides, the one-time contribution isn't enough. The author has the right to set boundaries, especially if they're feeling taken advantage of. \n\nHowever, maybe the friend didn't realize that the author expected gas money. But given that it's been hundreds of times, it's reasonable to expect that the friend should have picked up on it. The author's decision to stop the rides is about setting a boundary, which is a personal choice. \n\nI think the key points are: the friend's consistent lack of contribution, the author's right to set boundaries, and the context that the friend only contributed once. The author isn't being unreasonable here. So the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
