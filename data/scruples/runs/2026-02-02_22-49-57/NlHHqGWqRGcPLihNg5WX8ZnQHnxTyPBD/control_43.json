      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the friend has been using the author's car for rides countless times without contributing to gas. The author forgot their purse at home, and the friend put $10 in gas as a way to return it. The author then told the friend to find their own way around.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. If the friend has always taken rides without contributing, the author might feel it's unfair. The friend's action of putting gas in might have been a one-time gesture, but the author is ending the rides entirely. Is that a disproportionate response?\n\nThe author is the one who allows the rides, so they have the right to set boundaries. If the friend never contributed before, the author could have asked for contributions earlier. However, the friend's $10 might not have been a regular contribution but just returning something the author forgot. The author's response might be seen as fair because they're setting a boundary now, especially after the friend's one-time help. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that ending all rides over a single instance is harsh, especially if the friend has been a regular rider for a long time. But the author is the car owner and can decide who uses their car. The friend's occasional help doesn't negate the past use without contributions. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're asserting their own terms now. The friend might have expected continued free rides, but the author is within their rights to change the arrangement.\n"
