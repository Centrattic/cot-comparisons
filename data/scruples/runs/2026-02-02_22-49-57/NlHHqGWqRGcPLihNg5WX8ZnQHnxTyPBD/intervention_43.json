      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this situation. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. Let's break it down.\n\nFirst, the friend regularly gets rides in the author's car, covers the gas sometimes. This time, the author forgot their purse, so the friend put in $10 for gas. The next day, the author asked for the money back. The friend had ridden hundreds of times without paying before. Now the author is saying the friend should find their own way around.\n\nThe key points here are the friend's past behavior and the author's response. The friend usually doesn't pay for gas, so this single instance of paying might not make up for all the free rides. The author is now cutting off rides completely, which could be seen as holding the friend to a different standard than they've been following. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the friend did contribute once when asked, but the author is ending all rides. The friend might feel that one instance of paying isn't enough to make up for the past, so the author's response might be seen as unfair. However, the author has the right to set boundaries about their own car and who pays. \n\nBut maybe the author should have handled it differently, like asking for payment each time instead of cutting off rides entirely. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the friend's past actions were free rides, the author is not wrong to set a boundary. The friend's one-time payment doesn't obligate the author to continue free rides. So the answer is B.\n"
