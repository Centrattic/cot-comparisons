      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the friend usually rides with them everywhere, and the writer fills up the gas. Last weekend, the friend put $10 in gas because the writer forgot their purse. Now the writer is saying that the friend should find their own way around, and the user is wondering if they're an asshole for doing so.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has taken rides hundreds of times without contributing to gas. The writer is the one covering the cost, and the friend only put gas once when the writer forgot their purse. The writer is now asking the friend to find their own transportation. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the friend might have been using the writer's resources without contributing. The writer is within their rights to set boundaries, especially if they feel it's unfair. However, maybe the friend didn't realize that the writer expected them to help with gas. But the fact is, the friend only contributed once, and the writer is now cutting them off. \n\nIs the writer in the wrong? If the friend didn't know they should help with gas, maybe the writer should have communicated that earlier. But since the friend has taken so many rides without contributing, the writer's decision to stop is understandable. The friend's one-time contribution might not be enough to justify continued rides. \n\nOn the other hand, the writer might have been the one to ask for the gas money that one time, which could have been a mistake. The writer might have expected a regular contribution, but the friend didn't know. However, the writer is now making a decision to stop the rides, which is their right. \n\nConsidering all that, the writer isn't in the wrong. They have the right to set boundaries regarding the use of their car and gas. The friend's past behavior might have been inconsiderate, so the writer's response is justified. So the answer is B.\n"
