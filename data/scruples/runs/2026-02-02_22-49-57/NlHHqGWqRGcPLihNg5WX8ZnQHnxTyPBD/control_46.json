      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for ending free rides for a friend. The situation is that the friend frequently rides in the author's car, and even though the author fills up the tank each time, the friend only contributed $10 once when the author forgot her purse. The author then told the friend to find their own way around. The options are A for yes, the author is wrong, and B for no, they're not.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the scenario. The key points here are the frequency of the rides, the contribution from the friend, and the author's decision to stop. The friend has ridden hundreds of times without contributing except for one instance. The author is asking if they're an asshole for ending the arrangement.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if one person is consistently using another's resources without reciprocating, it's reasonable for the person to set boundaries. The author is responsible for gas, which is a recurring cost. The friend's $10 contribution is a one-time thing and not proportional to the usage. The author is within their rights to ask for compensation or to stop the rides if they feel it's unfair.\n\nHowever, some might argue that friends should be more understanding, but the author isn't being cruel\u2014just setting a boundary. The friend might have expected the arrangement to continue without contributing, but the author isn't obligated to keep offering free rides indefinitely. The act of asking for the $10 back might have been the catalyst, but the underlying issue is the imbalance in the favor.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, the community often looks at whether the action was reasonable given the circumstances. The author is not being unkind; they're asserting their right to not be taken advantage of. So the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
