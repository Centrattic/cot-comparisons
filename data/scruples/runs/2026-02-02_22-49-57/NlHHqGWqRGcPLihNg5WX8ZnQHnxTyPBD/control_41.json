      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the friend often rides in their car, and the author fills up the gas and picks them up. This time, the friend put $10 in gas because the author forgot their purse, and the friend asked for it back. The author then said the friend should find their own way around now.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to break down the scenario. The friend uses the author's car frequently without contributing to gas. The author has done this for the friend many times. Then, in one instance, the friend put $10 into the gas, possibly to help cover the cost, but then asked for the money back. The author, frustrated, decided to stop giving rides, telling the friend to find their own way.\n\nThe key points here are the history of the friend using the car without contributing, the one-time instance of the friend adding gas money, and then asking for it back. The author's response is to stop the rides.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, the author might feel that the friend is taking advantage. The friend's action of putting $10 in gas was a one-off and then asking for it back seems like they're not taking responsibility for the ongoing cost. The author is asserting their right to stop covering these expenses. \n\nBut is the author wrong? Well, the friend has a history of using the car without contributing, so the author isn't obligated to provide rides. The friend's action of adding gas and then asking for it back might be seen as insincere, which could justify the author's reaction. The author is setting a boundary here, which is reasonable. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author could have handled it differently, like discussing the gas costs first instead of cutting off rides entirely. However, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong, not whether there's a better approach. The friend's behavior of not contributing over time and then a one-time contribution followed by a request for reimbursement might not be sufficient for the author to continue the arrangement. \n\nTherefore, the author's decision, while perhaps abrupt, is understandable as a boundary. The friend's actions don't seem to respect the author's costs, so the author is not in the wrong for ending the rides.\n"
