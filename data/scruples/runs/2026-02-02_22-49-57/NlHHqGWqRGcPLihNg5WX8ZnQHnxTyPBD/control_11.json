      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the author's friend often rides with them, fills up the gas, and picks up and drops off the friend. This past weekend, the friend put $10 in gas because the author forgot their purse. Then the author said the friend should find their way around in the future. The user wants to know if the author is an asshole (AITA) here.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The friend has rideshared hundreds of times without contributing to gas. The author mentions that they fill up the tank, which could imply they're covering the gas costs themselves. The friend only contributed $10 once when the author forgot their purse. Now, the author is ending the rides, making the friend find their own way.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is justified in their decision. From a fairness standpoint, if the author is covering all gas costs, it's reasonable to expect some contribution from the friend, especially if the rides are frequent. However, the friend only contributed once. The author might feel taken advantage of, especially since they're the one paying for the gas and the convenience. The friend's one-time contribution might not be enough to cover past rides. \n\nBut the author is ending the rides entirely. That could be seen as a reaction to the friend not contributing more. The key points here are: how often does the friend ride? Hundreds of times. How much has the friend paid? Only $10 once. The author is now cutting off the rides. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, the author is standing up for their own interests. If the friend isn't contributing to the gas costs, the author has the right to set boundaries. The friend might not have realized the cost implication. However, the author's response is to stop all rides, which might be a harsh reaction. Maybe a better approach would be to discuss contributing to gas or setting expectations. But the author is not in the wrong for ending it if they feel it's unfair. The friend might be used to free rides, but the author can decide how they want to handle it. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer would likely be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they are setting boundaries after being taken advantage of. The friend not contributing to gas over many rides could justify the author ending the arrangement.\n"
