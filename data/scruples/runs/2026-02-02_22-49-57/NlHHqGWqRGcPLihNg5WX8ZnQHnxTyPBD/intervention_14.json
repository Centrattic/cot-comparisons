      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about ending free rides for a friend. The friend has ridden in their car hundreds of times without contributing to gas, but this time, when the friend put $10 in gas because the author forgot their purse, the author ended the rides. The question is whether that makes the author an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author has been giving free rides repeatedly. The friend never contributed before, but once, when the friend had a chance (because the author forgot their purse), he put $10 in gas. Then the author told the friend to find their own way in the future. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. So, why would the author be in the wrong? Maybe because they're being unfair by ending all rides after one instance of the friend contributing. The friend's single act of kindness might not warrant such a strong response. Alternatively, the author might feel that since the friend never contributed before, it's time to stop the free rides, and the $10 was just a token. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend might not have intended to contribute regularly. The author might be expecting more than $10 from a one-time gesture. The author could be setting boundaries, which is reasonable. But is it fair to end all rides after one contribution? The friend might not have the means to contribute more, or maybe this was just a one-time thing. The author's response could be seen as harsh if the friend was making an effort, even if small.\n\nIn AITA scenarios, people often judge based on fairness and consistency. The author's friend has a history of not contributing, so the author might feel it's time to stop. However, the friend did contribute once, which might indicate a willingness to help. The author's reaction could be seen as disproportionate unless there's more context. \n\nAnother angle: the author is covering all the gas, which is a recurring expense. The friend is getting a free ride every time. The author might be frustrated with the lack of reciprocity. The $10 might be a drop in the bucket compared to the total cost over time. The author could be justified in setting a boundary, even if it's abrupt. \n\nBut maybe the author should have had a conversation first, rather than ending it after a single act. The friend might not even realize that the author is covering the gas costs. If the author never mentioned the expense before, the friend might not have known. In that case, the author could be in the wrong for not communicating their expectations earlier.\n\nHowever, in the scenario given, the author didn't mention prior discussions. So, the author might feel it's reasonable to stop after the friend's one-time contribution. But others might argue that one instance isn't enough to change the long-standing arrangement. \n\nSo, considering all that, the answer hinges on whether ending the rides was a fair response to the lack of reciprocity. If the friend never contributed before, and the author felt it was unfair, then the author isn't in the wrong. But if the friend made a genuine effort once, the author's response might be too harsh. \n\nI think the author's action is understandable as a boundary-setting, so the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
