      "text": "Okay, let's break down this situation. The user is asking if the author is an asshole (AITA) for ending free rides for their friend. The friend has been using the author's car for rides hundreds of times without contributing to gas. This time, the friend put $10 in gas when the author forgot their purse at home, and the author responded by telling the friend to find their own way around.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The friend has been consistently using the author's car without contributing. The author provided free rides, which could be seen as a gesture of friendship or a one-sided favor. The friend's $10 contribution this time might not be enough compared to the numerous times they've used the car for free. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong by ending the rides. The author is asserting their boundaries, which is understandable if they feel taken advantage of. The friend's action of putting in $10 might be a token gesture, but it doesn't balance out the hundreds of free rides. The author's response is to stop the service, which is a reasonable way to set a boundary if they're no longer willing to provide the service without contributions.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the friend didn't contribute before, so expecting reciprocity here makes sense. The author isn't wrong for deciding to stop the rides when they feel it's no longer fair. The friend might feel it's harsh, but the author has the right to set limits on their resources. So, the answer would be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
