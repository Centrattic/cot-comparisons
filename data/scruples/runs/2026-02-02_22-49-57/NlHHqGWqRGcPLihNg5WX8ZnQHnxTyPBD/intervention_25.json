      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the friend has been getting rides in the author's car, and the author fills up the gas. One time, the author forgot their purse, and the friend put in $10 for gas when they got it back. The author is saying that since the friend has ridden hundreds of times without contributing, they're asking if they're an asshole for telling the friend to find their own way around now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The friend uses the car regularly without contributing, which might be a one-sided arrangement. The author is covering all costs, including gas and maintenance. The friend's one-time contribution of $10 was in exchange for getting the purse back, not as a regular contribution. The author is now ending the arrangement, which might be seen as a response to the friend not contributing their fair share over time.\n\nIn terms of fairness, if the friend has been using the car for months or years without contributing, even a small amount, the author might feel it's unfair to bear all the costs. The friend's single act of putting gas money in after an incident doesn't necessarily make up for the hundreds of times before. The author is setting a boundary now, which could be seen as justified because the friend hasn't consistently shared the responsibility.\n\nHowever, maybe the author could have addressed the issue earlier or communicated their expectations. If there was no prior discussion about contributing to gas, the friend might not have known it was expected. But the author might argue that since the friend never contributed before, they didn't feel it was necessary. The friend's action of putting in $10 could be seen as a sign they were willing to help, but only when they had to return something the author forgot. That might not be a genuine offer to contribute regularly.\n\nIn terms of fairness and mutual respect, the author is within their rights to stop the arrangement if they feel it's one-sided. Ending it now isn't necessarily inconsiderate if they've been accommodating the friend for so long without any reciprocation. The friend might be expected to have offered to help with gas from the start, especially if the car is being used frequently. The author's request for the friend to find their own way is a reasonable boundary, especially given the lack of prior contribution.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is not in the wrong. They've set a boundary after a long period of one-sided use, and the friend didn't contribute regularly. The answer should be B.\n"
