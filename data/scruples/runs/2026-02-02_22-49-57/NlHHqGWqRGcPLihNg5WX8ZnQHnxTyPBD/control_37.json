      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is about ending free rides for a friend. The friend has used the writer's car many times without contributing to gas, but once added $10 when the writer forgot their purse. Now the writer is telling the friend to find their own way.\n\nHmm, first, the key points here. The friend has been getting rides regularly without paying for gas. The writer takes them to their house and back, filling up the tank. Then, once, when the friend put in $10, the writer asked for the money back. Now, the writer is ending the rides. The question is whether the writer is an asshole.\n\nI need to consider fairness. The friend has been using the car without contributing, which is a cost to the writer. Gasoline is a recurring expense, so the writer might be covering a lot of that. The friend's single $10 contribution might not cover much, maybe just one fill-up. The writer might feel that the friend isn't sharing the cost. \n\nOn the other hand, the friend might not have the means to pay, or maybe they thought it was a favor and didn't think about the cost. But the writer is under no obligation to provide these rides. They can set boundaries. The friend has been using this for a long time, so maybe the writer had the option to charge gas from the start but didn't. Now, they're changing the policy, which can be a problem. Changing the rules might be inconvenient for the friend, but the writer has the right to their own time and money.\n\nAlso, the situation where the friend put $10 in gas when the writer forgot their purse. The writer then asked for the money back. That might have confused the friend. If the writer is now ending the rides, it could be seen as being inconsistent. Maybe the friend tried to help once but the writer didn't accept the gesture, leading to the current situation.\n\nBut the main issue is whether the writer is in the wrong. The writer is not obligated to provide rides. They can decide to stop offering them. The fact that the friend didn't pay before might be a problem, but the writer can choose to set boundaries now. The writer isn't being unfair if they explain that they can't keep providing rides without some contribution. However, changing the policy suddenly might be an issue if there was an unspoken agreement before.\n\nAlternatively, if the writer had never mentioned the cost before, the friend might not have known to contribute. But the writer is now ending the rides, which is within their rights. They can ask the friend to arrange their own transport. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong) because the writer is setting a boundary they should have set earlier. The friend was using a service without contributing, and the writer has the right to change that. However, maybe the writer should have communicated earlier, but they aren't wrong for doing it now.\n"
