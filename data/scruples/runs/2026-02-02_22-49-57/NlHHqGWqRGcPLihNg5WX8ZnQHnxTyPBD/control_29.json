      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that their friend has been riding with them all the time, and even though they fill up the gas, the friend only put in $10 once when the author forgot their purse. Now the author told the friend to find their own way around.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend uses the author's car regularly without contributing to gas except for that one time. That seems a bit one-sided. The author is taking responsibility for gas and the convenience of picking up and dropping off the friend. The friend isn't contributing much, except in that one instance. \n\nIn terms of fairness, it's common for friends to split gas costs when carpooling, but if it's always the author's expense, maybe it's reasonable to set boundaries. The author might feel taken advantage of, especially if they're doing it hundreds of times. The friend's action of putting in $10 once might be a gesture, but it's not consistent. \n\nThe author's decision to stop giving rides could be seen as their right to set limits on their time and resources. However, maybe they should have communicated earlier about the gas expenses. But since the friend didn't contribute except once, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong by ending it. \n\nAlso, the friend might not have realized the impact of their actions. The author's request is reasonable to ask the friend to find their own transportation. So, considering all that, the answer is likely B (No, the author isn't in the wrong).\n"
