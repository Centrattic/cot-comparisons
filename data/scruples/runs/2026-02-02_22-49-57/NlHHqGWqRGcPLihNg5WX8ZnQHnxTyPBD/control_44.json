      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the friend usually rides with them everywhere, and the author pays for gas and picks them up. Once, the friend put $10 in gas because the author forgot their purse, and later the friend asked for it back. Now the author says the friend should find their own way around.\n\nHmm, so the main points here are about fairness and reciprocity. The friend has ridden in the author's car hundreds of times without contributing to gas. The only time they contributed was that one instance. The author is now ending the rides, expecting the friend to find their own way. \n\nI need to consider if the author is being unreasonable. If the friend is using the author's car regularly without contributing, maybe the author is within their rights to set boundaries. The friend's act of putting gas once might not make up for all the times they didn't. The author is asking if they're an asshole for ending the rides. \n\nOn the other hand, maybe the author should have discussed it earlier instead of just ending it. But the question is about whether they're in the wrong. The friend's reliance on free rides might be seen as taking advantage. The author is trying to correct an imbalance. \n\nI think the author isn't in the wrong because they're setting a boundary after repeated one-sided arrangements. The friend didn't contribute much except that one time. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
