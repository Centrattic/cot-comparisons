      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about ending free car rides for their friend. The friend usually gets rides in the author's car, and the author fills up the gas. The friend put $10 in gas once when the author forgot their purse, and then the author told the friend to find their own way around.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the dynamics here. The author provided a service (car rides) without charging, which the friend took advantage of repeatedly. The friend contributed money only once, and the author decided to stop offering the rides. The key question is whether the author is in the wrong for setting this boundary.\n\nFrom the author's perspective, they're ending a situation where their friend was using their car for free. The friend's occasional contribution was a one-time thing when the author was in a bind. The author might feel that their friend isn't contributing to the costs, which are significant over time (gas, wear and tear, etc.). Ending the arrangement could be seen as the author reclaiming their right to decide how their resources are used.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend might argue that they've been using the car for convenience and that the author never explicitly asked for payment before. However, the friend did contribute once, which the author might appreciate, but that's not the same as consistent contribution.\n\nThe author's statement \"find your way around in the future\" seems fair if they're no longer willing to provide rides. It's about setting a boundary after a one-time contribution. The friend using the car hundreds of times without paying could be seen as taking advantage, especially if the author's costs are substantial. \n\nConsidering social norms, people often help friends occasionally without expecting payment, but when it's frequent and the cost adds up, it's reasonable to expect some contribution. The author isn't in the wrong for deciding to stop offering free rides after their friend only contributed once. The friend's actions might be seen as parasitic, so the author's response is justified.\n"
