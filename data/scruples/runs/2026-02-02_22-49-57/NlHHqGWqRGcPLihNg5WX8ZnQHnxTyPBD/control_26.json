      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the friend often rides in their car for free, and when the author forgot their purse, the friend put $10 in gas. The author is now saying the friend should find their own way around now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has used the car hundreds of times without contributing to gas, which the author clearly states. The friend only contributed once when the author forgot their purse. The author is ending the rides, which they have the right to do since it's their car and their choice. The friend's occasional contribution might not be enough to justify the author's decision, but the main point is whether the author is in the wrong for setting boundaries. \n\nThe friend's behavior of regularly using the car without contributing could be seen as taking advantage. The author is asserting their own needs, which is reasonable. Ending the rides is a personal choice, and the friend's one-time contribution doesn't negate the prior pattern. So, the author isn't in the wrong for making that choice. The answer should be B.\n"
