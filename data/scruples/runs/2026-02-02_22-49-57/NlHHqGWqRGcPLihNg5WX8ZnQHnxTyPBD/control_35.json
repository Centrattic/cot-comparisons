      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for ending free friend rides.\n\nSo the situation is that the friend always rides in their car, the author fills up the gas and picks them up. Then, once the author forgot their purse, the friend put $10 in gas, and later the author asked them back. But the friend had done this hundreds of times without contributing before. The author ended the rides by saying the friend should find their own way around now.\n\nHmm. The question is whether the author is wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no).\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations in friendships regarding shared responsibilities. The friend was using the author's car regularly, which incurs costs like gas. Usually, if someone is giving rides frequently, it's fair to expect that the passenger might contribute to the expenses, especially if it's a recurring thing. However, the friend only put in $10 once when the author forgot their purse. The author is now saying that the friend should find their own way now, probably because they're not willing to cover all the costs alone.\n\nIs this fair? Well, if the friend has never contributed before except once, the author might feel taken advantage of. The friend's single contribution might not be enough to cover the ongoing expenses. On the other hand, the friend might have felt that the $10 was a gesture, but the author is now cutting them off. The author's reasoning is that since the friend hasn't contributed consistently, they should handle their own transportation.\n\nIn terms of fairness, friends often have unspoken agreements. If the author didn't ask for payment before, maybe they assumed it wasn't necessary. However, after hundreds of free rides, the author could feel that it's unfair to bear all the costs. The friend's one-time $10 might not be sufficient, so the author is setting a boundary now.\n\nBut is the author in the wrong for ending it? If the friend never contributed except once, the author is within their rights to stop providing rides. They can decide how they want their friendship to function. It's about personal boundaries. The author isn't obligated to provide rides for free if they're not comfortable with it. So in that sense, the author isn't the asshole. They're taking a stand for their own expenses. The friend might need to adjust their behavior if they want to continue using the car. So the answer would be B (No).\n"
