      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for ending free friend rides. The situation is that the friend has been getting rides in their car for a long time, and the author fills up the gas tank. The friend put gas in once when the author forgot their purse, and then later asked for it back. The author is now telling the friend to find their own way around.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The friend has been riding for hundreds of times without contributing to gas. The one time they did put in gas was when the author forgot their purse, and then they wanted it back. The author is ending the rides, and the question is whether that makes them an asshole.\n\nSo, from a fairness perspective, the friend has been using the author's car and gas without contributing. The author is now setting boundaries, which is reasonable. The friend's action of putting gas in once but then asking for it back seems like a selfish move. The author is within their rights to expect some contribution, especially since they're using their own resources (gas money) for the friend's convenience. The fact that the friend didn't help before but only once, and then wanted it back, suggests that the friend isn't contributing fairly. \n\nThe author is not wrong for setting a boundary after being taken advantage of. It's about mutual respect and sharing responsibilities. The friend's behavior might have been free-riding, so the author's response is justified. Therefore, the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
