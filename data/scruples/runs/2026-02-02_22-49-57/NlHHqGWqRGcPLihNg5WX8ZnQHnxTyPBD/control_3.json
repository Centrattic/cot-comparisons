      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the friend has used their car hundreds of times without contributing to gas. This time, the author forgot their purse, so the friend put in $10 for gas and then asked for it back the next day. The author is now telling the friend to find their own way around in the future.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The friend has been getting free rides regularly, which the author is now deciding to stop. The friend did return $10, which was an act of goodwill, but the author is still cutting off the rides. The main question is whether the author is an asshole for doing this.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the friend has never contributed before, and this was a one-time return of money. The author is probably tired of covering all the gas costs and wants the friend to take responsibility. Ending the free rides now seems reasonable because the friend isn't consistently contributing. The fact that the friend put in $10 once might not be enough to justify continuing the favor. \n\nAlso, the author is setting boundaries. Friends should share responsibilities, and if the friend has been using their car without contributing, it's one-sided. The author might feel taken advantage of. The friend's action of returning the money could be a sign that they are aware of the situation but maybe didn't realize the author wanted them to contribute regularly. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They have the right to end a favor that's been abused, especially if it's costing them money. The friend should have been contributing all along, and the author is just now asserting their right to stop. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
