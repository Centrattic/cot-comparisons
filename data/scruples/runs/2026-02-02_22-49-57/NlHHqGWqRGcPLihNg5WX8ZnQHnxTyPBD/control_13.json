      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. Let me break down the situation.\n\nThe friend regularly takes rides in the author's car, with the author handling gas. The friend only put gas in once when the author forgot their purse. The author is annoyed and told the friend to find another way. The question is whether the author is an asshole (AITA) for doing this.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of both parties. The author might feel that they've been doing all the work, paying for gas, and doing the driving, while the friend has taken advantage of this repeatedly. The friend's one time helping was when the author forgot something, but that's not consistent. The author has a right to their own time and money, and it's reasonable to expect some reciprocation, especially when it's a frequent occurrence.\n\nOn the other hand, the friend might feel that they're just using a ride when needed, and maybe they didn't realize it was a problem. However, the author pointing out the imbalance is justified. The friend's one act of putting gas in is not equivalent to the hundreds of times they've been given free rides. The author is setting a boundary, which is a normal thing to do in relationships to prevent being taken advantage of.\n\nI should also think about social norms. While helping friends is common, it's not fair to expect one person to bear all the costs indefinitely without any contribution. The author is asserting their right to not be exploited, so their action makes sense. The friend's initial help was a one-time thing, so the author's frustration is understandable. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong here.\n"
