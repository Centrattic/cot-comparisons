      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by understanding the situation.\n\nThe user is asking if they're an asshole for ending free rides for their friend. The friend always uses their car, fills up the gas tank, and drops off the friend safely. This past weekend, the friend put $10 in gas because the user forgot their purse at home. Then yesterday, the friend asked the user back for the purse. The user is now saying that the friend should find their own way around. The user is wondering if they're the asshole here.\n\nFirst, let's break down the key points. The user's friend has ridden in their car hundreds of times without contributing to the gas. This time, the friend put $10 in gas when the user forgot their purse. Now the user is ending the free rides, saying the friend should find their own transportation. The user is questioning if they're wrong for doing that.\n\nSo, the main question is: Is the user in the wrong for ending the free rides after only one instance of the friend contributing to gas?\n\nFrom my perspective, when someone regularly uses your resources (like your car and gas), it's reasonable to expect some reciprocity. However, in this case, the friend only contributed once. The user's friend had been taking rides without contributing for hundreds of times, and only once put in $10. The user is now ending the rides, which could be seen as a response to the lack of consistent contribution. But maybe the user is overreacting because one instance isn't enough to justify ending the arrangement, especially since the friend might not have been able to contribute before.\n\nOn the other hand, maybe the user is within their rights to set boundaries. If the user feels that the friend isn't contributing their fair share, they can decide to stop providing the service. The friend might have been relying on the user's generosity, and the user is asserting their own needs. However, it's possible that the user is being too harsh, especially if the friend is trying to help out now but had no prior ability to contribute.\n\nAnother angle: The user might have a valid point about reciprocity. If the friend is using the car regularly, especially with gas costs, it's fair to expect some contribution. The fact that the friend only contributed once might indicate that they aren't willing to share the cost, so the user is justified in ending the rides. But maybe the user should have discussed it earlier instead of ending it abruptly.\n\nBut the user's reasoning is that the friend has taken rides hundreds of times without contributing, and now after one instance of helping, the user is cutting off the rides. That might seem a bit unfair, as one instance isn't enough. However, the user could argue that they're setting a boundary now, and the friend needs to contribute if they want to continue using the service.\n\nI need to consider cultural norms and expectations. In some contexts, friends helping each other out with rides is common without expecting payment. However, if the cost is significant, contributing to gas makes sense. The user might have been expecting this all along but didn't mention it, so the friend didn't know. The user could be in the right for setting a boundary now, especially if the gas costs are adding up.\n\nAlternatively, the user might be in the wrong if they didn't communicate their expectations earlier. If the friend wasn't aware that they needed to contribute, then ending it now without prior discussion could be abrupt. But the user is now making a rule that the friend needs to contribute, which is reasonable.\n\nSo, considering all this, I think the user is not in the wrong. They have the right to set boundaries regarding their car and gas. The friend's one-time contribution might not be enough, but the user is now asserting their right to have the friend contribute if they want to use the car. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
