      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who ended free rides for their friend is in the wrong. The situation is that the friend usually gets rides in their car without contributing to gas, but once they did put in $10 when the author forgot their purse. Now the author is telling the friend to find their own way around.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has taken hundreds of free rides, using the author's car and gas. Then, one time, the friend put in $10. The author is upset about that and now wants to stop giving rides. The key question is whether the author is being unreasonable by ending the rides.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if someone consistently uses your resources without contributing, it's reasonable to set boundaries. The friend's one-time contribution might be a nice gesture, but it's not consistent. The author has a right to expect some contribution, especially since they're using their own money for gas. \n\nHowever, the friend might not have intended to pay every time but just did once. But the author's main point is that they've always taken rides for free. The author is within their rights to ask for payment or stop the rides if they feel it's unfair. \n\nSo, the author isn't in the wrong. They're setting a boundary after repeated one-sided usage. The friend's actions don't show consistent responsibility, so the author's response is justified. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
