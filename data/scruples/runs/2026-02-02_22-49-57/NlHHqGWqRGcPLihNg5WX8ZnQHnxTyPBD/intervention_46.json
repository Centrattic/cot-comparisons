      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author provided free rides to a friend hundreds of times, but this one time, when the author forgot their purse, the friend put $10 into the gas. Now the author says they told the friend to find their own way around in the future.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The friend has been taking rides without contributing to gas costs, except this one time. The author is ending the arrangement. The question is whether the author is an asshole for doing so.\n\nFrom the description, the author is the one who's been driving, filling the tank, and picking up and dropping off the friend. The friend didn't pay for gas before, but once did. Now the author is ending the rides. The author's reasoning might be that the friend never paid before, so this one-time contribution isn't enough to justify continuing the arrangement. The friend might argue that since they contributed once, they expect continued rides. But the author is setting boundaries.\n\nIn terms of social norms, if someone consistently uses a service without contributing, it's reasonable to set boundaries. The fact that the friend contributed once might be a red herring if they never did it before. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong for ending the rides, especially if they felt it was unfair or one-sided. However, maybe the author could have asked the friend to contribute more regularly instead of cutting it off entirely. But the author is within their rights to stop the arrangement. So the answer would likely be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
