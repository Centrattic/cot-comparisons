      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about ending free ride friend gas in their car. The friend usually gets rides everywhere in their car, with the author filling up the gas and picking them up and dropping them off. This past weekend, the friend put $10 into gas because the author forgot their purse at home, and yesterday the friend asked the author back for it. The author then said, \"find your way around in the future,\" implying they won't give rides anymore. The question is whether the author is an asshole for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The main point here is about reciprocity and fairness. The friend has been riding in the author's car hundreds of times without contributing to gas. The one time the friend contributed $10 was when the author forgot their purse. The author is now ending the rides because the friend expected a return of $10. \n\nThe key factors here are: \n1. The friend's consistent use of the author's car without paying for gas.\n2. The one-time instance where the friend did contribute, which the author might see as a favor or a repayment for the $10.\n3. The author's decision to stop providing rides, possibly because they feel the friend is taking advantage.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if the friend never contributed before and only did so once, expecting to get their money back might be unreasonable. The author might feel that the friend isn't contributing to the cost of gas, which is a recurring expense. The friend's action of putting $10 in gas could be seen as a one-time help, not a regular contribution. The author's response to stop rides could be seen as enforcing boundaries, which isn't necessarily wrong if the friend was consistently not contributing.\n\nHowever, the way the author ended the rides might come off as abrupt. The friend might not have realized that contributing to gas was expected. The author could have discussed it earlier instead of waiting until after the one-time contribution. But since the friend never contributed before, the author might feel justified in stopping the rides because the friend isn't covering the costs.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's common for friends to split gas costs when carpooling regularly. If the friend never did that, the author has a right to set boundaries. The one-time $10 might not be enough to make up for the hundreds of rides without payment. So, the author is not in the wrong for ending the rides if they feel the arrangement is unfair. The answer would likely be B (No).\n"
