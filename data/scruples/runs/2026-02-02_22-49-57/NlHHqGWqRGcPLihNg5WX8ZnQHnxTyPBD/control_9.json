      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong. The situation is about ending free friend rides. The friend usually rides in their car, gets picked up and dropped off, and fills the tank once when the author forgot their purse. Now the author says to find their way around, and the question is whether that makes them an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics. The friend has used the author's car hundreds of times without contributing gas. Then, once, the friend put in $10 because the author forgot their purse. The author is ending the rides, and the friend is being asked to find their own way. \n\nThe author's action is about setting a boundary. The friend didn't contribute to gas until that one time. The author might feel taken advantage of. The friend might think they're helping by putting gas once, but the author's point is that they should have been contributing all along. \n\nIs the author in the wrong? Well, they're asking their friend to stop using their car without contributing. That seems reasonable. The friend didn't pay for gas except once. So the author isn't being unfair by ending the arrangement. Maybe the friend should have been paying for gas from the start, but the author is now setting a boundary. \n\nBut maybe the author should have addressed it earlier instead of ending it now. However, the post doesn't mention prior complaints. The author just decided to stop after the one time the friend helped. The friend might feel it's a sudden change, but the author has a right to their car and their own fuel costs. \n\nSo the answer is probably B, the author is not in the wrong. They're standing up for themselves after the friend rarely contributed. The friend's action of putting gas once isn't enough; maybe the author expected more. But the author isn't wrong to end the rides now.\n"
