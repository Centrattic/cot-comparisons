      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're an asshole for ending free rides for their friend. The friend usually rides with them a lot, using the car without contributing to gas. This time, the friend put $10 in gas when the author forgot their purse, and later asked for it back. The author then said the friend should find their own way around now.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the friend had been using the car for rides without contributing to gas costs, which is probably costing the author money. The friend made an exception by putting $10 in gas once but then asked for it back, which seems like a request for reimbursement. The author decided to stop giving rides after that.\n\nThe question is whether the author was wrong. From a fairness perspective, if the friend consistently uses the car without contributing, it's reasonable for the author to expect some contribution. The friend's action of putting gas once might not be enough to make up for the hundreds of times they didn't. Also, asking for the $10 back could be seen as the friend recognizing the cost, which the author might find reasonable to reciprocate in the future. But the friend didn't contribute before, so the author might feel it's unfair to keep covering the costs.\n\nIn terms of social norms, friends often help each other, but there's a line when it's one-sided. The author isn't being rude by ending the rides; they're setting boundaries. The friend might not have realized the impact of their actions. The author's action could be seen as a way to enforce fairness. So, the answer would likely be B, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
