      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the friend has been getting free rides in the author's car for a long time. The author fills up the tank, picks the friend up, and drops him off. Recently, the friend put $10 into gas because the author had forgotten her purse at home and eventually asked for it back. Now, the author is telling the friend to find his own way around. The question is whether the author is an asshole for ending the free rides.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has been using the author's car for hundreds of rides without contributing to gas. The author is covering all the costs. That seems one-sided. The friend's action of putting $10 into gas was a one-time thing, maybe as a gesture when the author asked for her purse back. But before that, there was no contribution. \n\nThe author is now ending the arrangement. The key points here are about fairness and boundaries. The author might feel that they've been shouldering all the costs, and the friend hasn't contributed. The friend, on the other hand, might feel that it's a regular arrangement and that the one-time $10 was enough, or maybe that the author is being stingy. \n\nIn terms of social norms, it's common for people to expect some contribution towards shared expenses, especially if it's a frequent arrangement. If the author is covering all gas costs for hundreds of rides, that's a significant expense. The friend putting $10 in once might not be sufficient. The author has the right to set boundaries and decide that they no longer want to bear all the costs. \n\nHowever, there's also the aspect of how the situation was handled. The author could have asked the friend to contribute a bit each time, or set a mutual agreement earlier on. Ending it abruptly might come off as harsh, but given the one-sided nature of the arrangement, the author's decision to stop could be seen as reasonable. \n\nSo, the friend was using the car without contributing, and the author is now ending it. The friend might need to find alternative transportation. The author isn't in the wrong for setting a boundary after realizing the imbalance. The key here is that the friend didn't contribute before, and the author is asserting their right to stop the free rides. Therefore, the author is not the asshole.\n"
