      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the friend has been riding in their car hundreds of times without contributing to gas, but this time, the friend put in $10 for gas. The author then told the friend to find their own way around.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend usually doesn't pay for gas, but this time they did. The author might have expected the friend to continue paying, but the friend only did it once. The author then decided to stop giving rides. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, if the friend has been using the car for a long time without contributing, it's reasonable for the author to set boundaries. The friend putting in $10 once might not be enough to justify continuing the rides if the pattern was always free. The author is asserting their right to not subsidize the friend's transportation indefinitely. \n\nAlso, the author mentioned that they fill up the tank themselves. So, the cost is coming out of their pocket each time. It's a personal choice to offer rides, but over time, that can add up. The friend's one-time payment might not be sufficient if the expectation was consistent contribution. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that the friend tried to compensate once, and the author was too quick to end the arrangement. But the key point is that the friend never contributed before except this one time. The author is probably fed up after hundreds of free rides. \n\nSo, in terms of whether the author is an asshole, it seems like they're standing up for themselves. They're not obligated to provide rides without contribution. The friend's lack of prior payment is a significant factor here. The author isn't wrong for setting limits on their generosity. Therefore, the answer should be B (No).\n"
