      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about ending free car rides for their friend. The writer's friend has been taking rides in their car hundreds of times without contributing to gas, except once when they put in $10. The writer then told the friend to find their own way around in the future.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations here. The friend was using the writer's car regularly without paying for gas, which is a recurring expense. The writer might feel that this is unfair, especially since they're covering all the costs. The friend only contributed once, which seems minimal compared to the number of times they've ridden. \n\nThe key points here are: \n1. The friend's consistent use of the car without contributing. \n2. The one-time $10 contribution. \n3. The writer's decision to stop offering rides. \n\nI should think about social norms. It's common for friends to share rides occasionally, but when it's frequent and one person is always using the other's resources without reciprocation, that can be seen as one-sided. The writer might feel exploited, especially if they're shouldering all the costs. \n\nThe friend's action of putting in $10 might be a gesture, but if the rides are hundreds of times, $10 isn't covering the actual cost. Gas prices vary, but even at $3 a gallon, $10 might cover a few gallons. Depending on the distance of the rides, that's not much. So, the writer is probably justified in feeling that the friend isn't contributing their fair share.\n\nIn terms of the writer ending the rides, they're setting a boundary. It's their car and their money. They have the right to decide who uses their resources and under what terms. The friend might have expected the rides to continue for free, but the writer is no longer willing to accommodate that. \n\nHowever, some might argue that the friend didn't realize the extent of the cost or didn't know they were expected to pay. But the writer hasn't mentioned discussing this with the friend beforehand. Maybe they should have set expectations from the start. But since they didn't, the friend might not have known. \n\nBut in this case, the writer is now setting a boundary, which is reasonable. The friend's one-time contribution wasn't enough, so the writer is ending the arrangement. The writer isn't in the wrong because they're taking control of their resources. The friend is the one who's been using the service without proper contribution. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The writer is justified in ending the free rides after the friend didn't contribute appropriately over time.\n"
