      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about ending free friend rides in their car. The friend often rides with them, and the author fills up the gas. Last weekend, the friend put $10 in gas because the author forgot their purse. Now the author is telling the friend to find their own way around.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The friend has used the car hundreds of times without contributing to gas. The one time they did contribute was when the author forgot their purse. The author is now ending the rides, and the friend might be upset. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for doing so.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I should consider common perspectives. Carpooling and gas contributions can be a point of contention. If someone regularly uses your car without contributing, it's reasonable to expect some reciprocity. The friend did contribute once, but it was under unusual circumstances (the author forgot their purse). The author might feel that this one instance isn't enough to justify continued free rides. \n\nIn many \"AITA\" scenarios, fairness and consistency are key. The author is setting a boundary after repeated use without contribution. The friend might argue that the author offered rides out of kindness, but the author is justified in protecting their own resources. Gas costs money, and if the friend benefits from it repeatedly, it's reasonable to ask for some help with expenses. \n\nHowever, the author chose to end the rides abruptly, which might come off as harsh. Maybe a better approach would be to discuss gas contributions before ending the arrangement. But the friend didn't contribute except once, so the author's frustration is understandable. \n\nOverall, the author isn't in the wrong for setting a boundary. They have the right to decide who they want to ride with and under what conditions. The friend's lack of contribution over time makes the author's decision reasonable. So the answer should be B (No).\n"
