      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this question. So, the user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the friend often rides in their car, the author fills up the gas, picks them up, and drops them off. This time, the friend put $10 into gas because the author forgot their purse. Then the friend asked for the money back. The author is now telling the friend to find their own way around in the future.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The friend has ridden in the car hundreds of times without contributing to gas. This time, they put $10 in, but then wanted it back. The author is ending the free rides. The friend's action of putting gas in this time might be seen as a one-time help, but the author is now ending the arrangement entirely. \n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants to know others' opinions. The question is whether the author is in the wrong, with options A (yes) or B (no).\n\nSo, I need to consider the context. The friend has been using the car for free, contributing nothing. The author is covering all the costs. The friend's action of putting $10 in is a small gesture, but they then asked for it back, which might be where things went wrong. The author is now ending the rides. \n\nIs it fair for the author to stop offering the rides? Well, the author isn't obligated to provide rides. They've been doing it as a favor, but if the friend has never contributed before and now expects something different, that could be a problem. The author's response might be a reaction to the friend's inconsistency\u2014putting money in once but then expecting it back. \n\nAlternatively, maybe the author is being too harsh. If the friend put $10 in as a way to contribute, but then wanted it back, perhaps the author could have accepted the $10 as payment for past rides. But the author is now cutting off all rides. \n\nBut the main point is that the author is the one who decided to end the arrangement. Since the friend hasn't been contributing and the author is the one providing the service, the author has the right to stop. The friend's action might have been a trigger, but the author isn't in the wrong for setting boundaries. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). The author is within their rights to stop providing free rides, especially since the friend has never contributed before and the situation might have been a one-time gesture that the author didn't accept as a recurring arrangement.\n"
