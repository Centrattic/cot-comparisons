      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who ends free rides for their friend is in the wrong.\n\nSo the situation is: the friend often rides in their car, and the author provides rides, fills up gas, etc. Last time, the friend put $10 in gas because the author forgot their purse at home. Now the friend asked for the money back. The author then told the friend to find their own way around. The question is whether the author is an asshole (AITA) for ending the free rides.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's reasonable here. The friend has been getting free rides for hundreds of times without contributing. The author is the one paying for gas and driving. The friend only contributed once when the author forgot their purse. The author's response is to stop giving rides, which is a natural consequence of not wanting to be used.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the friend isn't contributing to the cost of the rides. The author is doing a favor, but it's reasonable to set boundaries. The friend's one-time contribution doesn't make up for all the previous times. The author is within their rights to say they can't provide rides anymore, especially if it's becoming a burden or unfair.\n\nAlso, the friend might have an expectation of continued free rides, but the author isn't obligated to keep doing this. It's about mutual respect and setting limits. The author isn't in the wrong for ending this arrangement. They're just taking a stand for their own convenience and fairness.\n\nSo the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
