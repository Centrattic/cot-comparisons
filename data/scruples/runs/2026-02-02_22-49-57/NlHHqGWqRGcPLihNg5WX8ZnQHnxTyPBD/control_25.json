      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about ending free rides for a friend. The friend often rides in the author's car, uses the gas, and the author fills it up. This time, the friend put in $10 for gas because the author forgot her purse. The author then told the friend to find their own way. The question is whether the author is an asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The friend has been using the author's car many times without contributing to gas. Once, the friend put in $10, and the author decided to stop giving rides. The main issue is whether the author's reaction is justified.\n\nOn one hand, the author is entitled to their own transportation and can set boundaries. If the friend is taking advantage by not contributing to gas costs, the author is within their rights to say no. The fact that the friend contributed $10 once might not be enough to justify continued rides if the pattern was previously one-sided.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is ending the rides without considering the friend's possible reliance on this arrangement. Maybe the friend couldn't afford to contribute regularly, or there's an unspoken understanding. However, the author isn't obligated to provide transportation, especially if it's causing them financial or personal inconvenience.\n\nThe key here is whether the author's action is reasonable. Since the friend hasn't consistently contributed to gas, the author is not in the wrong for setting a boundary. The author isn't being cruel; they're stating that the friend should find their own way, which is fair if the rides were becoming a burden or an expectation without reciprocity.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They're asserting their right to control their own car and transportation choices, especially when the friend hasn't consistently contributed to the costs.\n"
