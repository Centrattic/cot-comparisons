      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for ending free rides for their friend. The situation is that the friend usually rides in their car without contributing to gas, but this time put $10 in gas after they forgot their purse. The author then told the friend to find their own way around.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The friend has ridden in the car hundreds of times without contributing. The author mentions filling up the tank and picking them up. So maybe the author is covering the gas costs themselves. The friend only contributed $10 once when they forgot their purse. The author ended the rides, asking the friend to find their own way. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The possible answers are A (yes, they're wrong) or B (no, they're not wrong). \n\nLooking at the situation from both sides. The author might feel that they've been covering all the gas costs, and the friend isn't contributing equally. The friend might see the $10 as a gesture to return a favor, but the author might feel that it's not enough and that the friend should contribute more regularly. \n\nIn many friendships, shared expenses can be a sensitive topic. If the author hasn't communicated their expectations before, it might be reasonable to expect the friend to cover their share of gas. However, since the friend didn't do that previously and only contributed once, the author might be justified in setting a boundary.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author considered the rides as part of their friendship without expecting payment, ending the rides abruptly might come off as sudden. But if the author was covering all the costs and the friend never contributed except once, then the author's decision to stop could be seen as their right to set boundaries.\n\nI think the key points here are communication and fairness. If the author never discussed the gas expenses, then maybe they should have. But if they were covering the costs and the friend never helped, then the author has a point. The friend's one-time $10 might not be sufficient if the author is covering all the time. \n\nSo, based on that, I would lean towards the author not being in the wrong. They're setting a boundary after contributing a lot without reciprocation. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
