      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who ended free friend rides is in the wrong.\n\nThe scenario is that the friend always rides in their car. The author fills up the tank, picks the friend up, drops him off. This past weekend, the friend put $10 in gas because the author forgot their purse at home, and then the friend asked to come back to get it. The author is now saying to find their own way around.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is an asshole for ending this. The user thinks the author is not in the wrong, but wants another opinion.\n\nFirst, consider the context. The friend has been using the author's car for rides hundreds of times without contributing, except once. The author provided the gas, did all the driving, and the friend's one time contribution was due to a specific situation where the author forgot their purse. The friend then asked to come back to retrieve it, implying another free ride.\n\nThe author is now telling the friend to find their own way. Is that reasonable? Well, the friend has been taking advantage of the author's generosity repeatedly. The author is not obligated to provide free rides. Even though there was one instance where the friend contributed, the overall pattern was the friend not contributing. The author is setting a boundary here after being taken advantage of. \n\nBut maybe the author could have addressed it earlier. However, the situation is that the friend's behavior was ongoing, and the author is now reacting. The key point is that the friend took advantage multiple times, and the author is correcting it. The author isn't wrong for deciding to stop providing free rides, especially if it's affecting them negatively. \n\nSo, the answer is B; the author is not in the wrong. They're setting a boundary after repeated use of their resources.\n"
