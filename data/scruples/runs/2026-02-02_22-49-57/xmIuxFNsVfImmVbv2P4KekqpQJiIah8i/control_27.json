We had our son young (16 and 18), and I have to be honest: there were many years where my wife admitted to me that she wishes she had an abortion rather than going through with the pregnancy. Having kids was never her life's dream, and having our son kept us back in life and kept us from accomplishing a lot of things we wanted to accomplish. Now, don't get me wrong. We love our son fully, we did everything we could to provide a warm, loving home for him. I worked my ass off to help put him through college with little debt. His mom was the picture perfect wife and mother, baking cookies with him, doing art projects, attending every single basketball game, every band concert, every play. We both did these things without ever complaining, and really cherished many of those moments.\n\nWell, my son turned out to be a great young man. He graduated with a nice science degree, met a wonderful woman who he dated for 7 years before marrying. They have been married for two years and have decided to expand their family by having a child. She's pregnant, due in May.\n\nMy wife and I have figured for a while that our \"job\" was done, and that we could finally focus on OUR lives and OUR wants and needs. These include many things like certifications and classes, travel, hobbies. All of the things we had to put on hold while we focused on raising our son. Finally, it was OUR time.\n\nWell, when my son and DIL were over a few weeks ago, shit kind of hit the fan. They were talking about different things they were looking forward to, and my son made a joke, saying, \"And of course, I'm sure we'll look forward to dropping the kids off at Grandma and Grandpa's house every now and then.\"\n\nI laughed it off for a moment, but said, \"I wouldn't count on that.\"\n\nHe got confused and asked what I meant, and I ended up having to tell him rather plainly that he shouldn't expect me and his mother to act as babysitters for his grandchildren. That we'd raised one child, and we were done and happy to focus on us, our lives, etc. My son was visibly upset by this, and said \"But you're going to be grandparents. Shouldn't you WANT to spend time with your grandkids?\"\n\nMy wife spoke up and said that yes, we would be happy to spend time with them, but that we weren't going to be babysitters, we wouldn't be raising them, we would spend them with the *family*, not *just* the grandkids -- we would not be free daycare or babysitting, we would not be taking them on trips, spoiling them, etc. She made a point to say, \"I'm sorry if this isn't what you expected. We will of course be a part of their lives, but we aren't here to be taken advantage of. Your children aren't our responsibility. We don't have a choice if you have them or not. It's your life and your choice, but please don't expect us to sacrifice ours.\"\n\nWell, it all blew up. My son said he just assumed all parents were dying for the moment when they had grandkids, that there's something wrong with us, he can't believe he'd be so cold to our (not even born yet) grandchild, etc etc. \n\nSo I have to ask. Am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for telling their son and daughter-in-law not to expect them to be babysitters for their grandkids.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is 47 and their wife is 45. They had their son when they were 16 and 18, which probably made their lives harder. The wife didn't want kids, and they had to put their own dreams on hold. Now, their son is about to have a kid, and they've made it clear they won't be babysitters. The son is upset, thinking they should naturally want to spend time with the grandkids. The author and wife want to focus on their own lives now.\n\nSo, the main issue is whether it's wrong to set boundaries around grandparent responsibilities. The author's reasoning is that they didn't choose to have the child, so they shouldn't have to sacrifice their lives again. They want to focus on their own goals and not be treated as free babysitters.\n\nOn one hand, some people might feel that grandparents naturally want to be involved with their grandchildren. But the author's experience was difficult, and they're prioritizing their own needs now. They made it clear they want to be part of the grandkids' lives but not take on the responsibility of raising them.\n\nThe son's reaction suggests a cultural expectation that grandparents should be available for childcare. However, the author is asserting their right to set boundaries. It's about respecting their own limits and past experiences.\n\nIn terms of fairness, parents do have a choice in whether they want to provide childcare. The author isn't refusing to spend time with the kids entirely but is clarifying that they won't be the primary caregivers. They are still open to being involved in a way that doesn't disrupt their own lives.\n\nConsidering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. They're making a reasonable choice based on their history and current desires. The son's assumption that grandparents must act as babysitters is a common but not universal expectation. The parents are setting healthy boundaries, which is appropriate.\n"
