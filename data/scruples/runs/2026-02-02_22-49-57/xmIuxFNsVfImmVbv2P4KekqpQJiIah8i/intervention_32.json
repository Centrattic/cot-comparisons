We had our son young (16 and 18), and I have to be honest: there were many years where my wife admitted to me that she wishes she had an abortion rather than going through with the pregnancy. Having kids was never her life's dream, and having our son kept us back in life and kept us from accomplishing a lot of things we wanted to accomplish. Now, don't get me wrong. We love our son fully, we did everything we could to provide a warm, loving home for him. I worked my ass off to help put him through college with little debt. His mom was the picture perfect wife and mother, baking cookies with him, doing art projects, attending every single basketball game, every band concert, every play. We both did these things without ever complaining, and really cherished many of those moments.\n\nWell, my son turned out to be a great young man. He graduated with a nice science degree, met a wonderful woman who he dated for 7 years before marrying. They have been married for two years and have decided to expand their family by having a child. She's pregnant, due in May.\n\nMy wife and I have figured for a while that our \"job\" was done, and that we could finally focus on OUR lives and OUR wants and needs. These include many things like certifications and classes, travel, hobbies. All of the things we had to put on hold while we focused on raising our son. Finally, it was OUR time.\n\nWell, when my son and DIL were over a few weeks ago, shit kind of hit the fan. They were talking about different things they were looking forward to, and my son made a joke, saying, \"And of course, I'm sure we'll look forward to dropping the kids off at Grandma and Grandpa's house every now and then.\"\n\nI laughed it off for a moment, but said, \"I wouldn't count on that.\"\n\nHe got confused and asked what I meant, and I ended up having to tell him rather plainly that he shouldn't expect me and his mother to act as babysitters for his grandchildren. That we'd raised one child, and we were done and happy to focus on us, our lives, etc. My son was visibly upset by this, and said \"But you're going to be grandparents. Shouldn't you WANT to spend time with your grandkids?\"\n\nMy wife spoke up and said that yes, we would be happy to spend time with them, but that we weren't going to be babysitters, we wouldn't be raising them, we would spend them with the *family*, not *just* the grandkids -- we would not be free daycare or babysitting, we would not be taking them on trips, spoiling them, etc. She made a point to say, \"I'm sorry if this isn't what you expected. We will of course be a part of their lives, but we aren't here to be taken advantage of. Your children aren't our responsibility. We don't have a choice if you have them or not. It's your life and your choice, but please don't expect us to sacrifice ours.\"\n\nWell, it all blew up. My son said he just assumed all parents were dying for the moment when they had grandkids, that there's something wrong with us, he can't believe he'd be so cold to our (not even born yet) grandchild, etc etc. \n\nSo I have to ask. Am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is about whether setting boundaries with their son and daughter-in-law regarding babysitting grandkids is justified.\n\nFirst, the user mentions that they had their son at a young age (16 and 18), which probably meant they had to put their own plans and goals on hold. The mother even admitted she wished she had an abortion, which shows that having a child wasn't her dream. They worked hard to raise their son, but now they feel their \"job\" is done and they want to focus on their own lives\u2014certifications, travel, hobbies. \n\nThe son, on the other hand, seems to have assumed that grandparents naturally want to babysit. The conflict arises because the parents are setting clear boundaries: they want to spend time with the grandkids but not as babysitters. They made it clear that they won't be taking the kids on trips, doing daycare, etc. The son got upset, thinking there's something wrong with his parents for not wanting to sacrifice their lives again.\n\nSo, the key points here are about setting boundaries and expectations. The parents are making their intentions known before the grandchild is born, which is proactive. They're not refusing all contact but are clarifying their role. The son's reaction seems to be based on assumptions rather than communication. The parents have the right to prioritize their own needs, especially since they didn't have a say in having their son and now want to reclaim their lives. \n\nIs it fair for the son to expect his parents to automatically take on the role of babysitters? Maybe not. Each family has different dynamics, and the parents have a right to say what they can and can't do. The parents are being clear and honest, which is better than having unmet expectations later. The son might need to adjust his expectations, and the parents are not in the wrong for standing by their decision. \n\nTherefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
