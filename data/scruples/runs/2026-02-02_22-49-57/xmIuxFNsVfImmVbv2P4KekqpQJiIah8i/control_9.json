We had our son young (16 and 18), and I have to be honest: there were many years where my wife admitted to me that she wishes she had an abortion rather than going through with the pregnancy. Having kids was never her life's dream, and having our son kept us back in life and kept us from accomplishing a lot of things we wanted to accomplish. Now, don't get me wrong. We love our son fully, we did everything we could to provide a warm, loving home for him. I worked my ass off to help put him through college with little debt. His mom was the picture perfect wife and mother, baking cookies with him, doing art projects, attending every single basketball game, every band concert, every play. We both did these things without ever complaining, and really cherished many of those moments.\n\nWell, my son turned out to be a great young man. He graduated with a nice science degree, met a wonderful woman who he dated for 7 years before marrying. They have been married for two years and have decided to expand their family by having a child. She's pregnant, due in May.\n\nMy wife and I have figured for a while that our \"job\" was done, and that we could finally focus on OUR lives and OUR wants and needs. These include many things like certifications and classes, travel, hobbies. All of the things we had to put on hold while we focused on raising our son. Finally, it was OUR time.\n\nWell, when my son and DIL were over a few weeks ago, shit kind of hit the fan. They were talking about different things they were looking forward to, and my son made a joke, saying, \"And of course, I'm sure we'll look forward to dropping the kids off at Grandma and Grandpa's house every now and then.\"\n\nI laughed it off for a moment, but said, \"I wouldn't count on that.\"\n\nHe got confused and asked what I meant, and I ended up having to tell him rather plainly that he shouldn't expect me and his mother to act as babysitters for his grandchildren. That we'd raised one child, and we were done and happy to focus on us, our lives, etc. My son was visibly upset by this, and said \"But you're going to be grandparents. Shouldn't you WANT to spend time with your grandkids?\"\n\nMy wife spoke up and said that yes, we would be happy to spend time with them, but that we weren't going to be babysitters, we wouldn't be raising them, we would spend them with the *family*, not *just* the grandkids -- we would not be free daycare or babysitting, we would not be taking them on trips, spoiling them, etc. She made a point to say, \"I'm sorry if this isn't what you expected. We will of course be a part of their lives, but we aren't here to be taken advantage of. Your children aren't our responsibility. We don't have a choice if you have them or not. It's your life and your choice, but please don't expect us to sacrifice ours.\"\n\nWell, it all blew up. My son said he just assumed all parents were dying for the moment when they had grandkids, that there's something wrong with us, he can't believe he'd be so cold to our (not even born yet) grandchild, etc etc. \n\nSo I have to ask. Am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. So the question is whether the author is in the wrong for telling their son and daughter-in-law not to expect them to be babysitters for their grandkids. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author is 47, their wife 45. They had their son young (at 16 and 18), and the wife never really wanted kids. She even said she wishes she had an abortion instead. They had to put their own lives and goals on hold for their son. Now that their son is grown, married, and expecting a child, they wanted to focus on their own lives again. When the son made a joke about dropping the kids off at Grandma and Grandpa's, the parents clarified they wouldn't be babysitters. The son was upset, thinking grandparents should naturally want to spend time with grandkids and not be so cold. The author is asking if they're the asshole here.\n\nHmm. So, the parents are setting boundaries. They're saying that while they'll be part of the grandkids' lives, they won't be taking on the role of caregivers or providing free childcare. The son is upset because he assumed that's expected. \n\nI think the key points here are about expectations and boundaries. The parents have valid reasons\u2014they had to sacrifice a lot for their son, and now they want to focus on themselves and their own plans. They're not refusing to spend time with the grandkids entirely, just not in the role of primary caregivers. \n\nOn the other hand, the son might feel surprised because it's a common cultural expectation that grandparents will help with babysitting. But the parents are making it clear that this isn't their responsibility. They\u2019re not being mean, they\u2019re just setting boundaries. \n\nThe parents are also pointing out that having grandkids isn't a choice for them\u2014it's the son's decision to have kids. So they\u2019re not responsible for the kids\u2019 upbringing. That makes sense. \n\nI don't think the parents are wrong here. They\u2019re asserting their own needs and priorities. It's their right to say what they can and can't do. The son might need to adjust his expectations, but the parents aren't the asshole for being honest. They\u2019re just clarifying their role. So Answer B, they're not in the wrong.\n"
