We had our son young (16 and 18), and I have to be honest: there were many years where my wife admitted to me that she wishes she had an abortion rather than going through with the pregnancy. Having kids was never her life's dream, and having our son kept us back in life and kept us from accomplishing a lot of things we wanted to accomplish. Now, don't get me wrong. We love our son fully, we did everything we could to provide a warm, loving home for him. I worked my ass off to help put him through college with little debt. His mom was the picture perfect wife and mother, baking cookies with him, doing art projects, attending every single basketball game, every band concert, every play. We both did these things without ever complaining, and really cherished many of those moments.\n\nWell, my son turned out to be a great young man. He graduated with a nice science degree, met a wonderful woman who he dated for 7 years before marrying. They have been married for two years and have decided to expand their family by having a child. She's pregnant, due in May.\n\nMy wife and I have figured for a while that our \"job\" was done, and that we could finally focus on OUR lives and OUR wants and needs. These include many things like certifications and classes, travel, hobbies. All of the things we had to put on hold while we focused on raising our son. Finally, it was OUR time.\n\nWell, when my son and DIL were over a few weeks ago, shit kind of hit the fan. They were talking about different things they were looking forward to, and my son made a joke, saying, \"And of course, I'm sure we'll look forward to dropping the kids off at Grandma and Grandpa's house every now and then.\"\n\nI laughed it off for a moment, but said, \"I wouldn't count on that.\"\n\nHe got confused and asked what I meant, and I ended up having to tell him rather plainly that he shouldn't expect me and his mother to act as babysitters for his grandchildren. That we'd raised one child, and we were done and happy to focus on us, our lives, etc. My son was visibly upset by this, and said \"But you're going to be grandparents. Shouldn't you WANT to spend time with your grandkids?\"\n\nMy wife spoke up and said that yes, we would be happy to spend time with them, but that we weren't going to be babysitters, we wouldn't be raising them, we would spend them with the *family*, not *just* the grandkids -- we would not be free daycare or babysitting, we would not be taking them on trips, spoiling them, etc. She made a point to say, \"I'm sorry if this isn't what you expected. We will of course be a part of their lives, but we aren't here to be taken advantage of. Your children aren't our responsibility. We don't have a choice if you have them or not. It's your life and your choice, but please don't expect us to sacrifice ours.\"\n\nWell, it all blew up. My son said he just assumed all parents were dying for the moment when they had grandkids, that there's something wrong with us, he can't believe he'd be so cold to our (not even born yet) grandchild, etc etc. \n\nSo I have to ask. Am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their son and daughter-in-law not to expect them to be babysitters for their grandkids.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is 47, their wife 45. They had their son when they were 16 and 18? Wait, that seems off. Wait, the user says they had their son young (16 and 18). So the son is now 29 or so. They mention that the mother wasn't a big fan of having kids, it wasn't her dream, and it held them back from other things. But they did their best to provide a good home. Now, the son is married, expecting a child, and they told him they won't be babysitters. The son was upset, thinking grandparents should want to spend time. The parents say they want to focus on their own lives, certifications, travel, etc.\n\nSo the question is, are the parents wrong for setting this boundary?\n\nFrom a general perspective, grandparents do have the right to set boundaries. Raising kids is a big commitment, and if they choose not to take on babysitting responsibilities, that's their choice. However, the way they communicated it might be an issue. The son felt it was an assumption that they would automatically be available. The parents might have been too blunt, especially when the grandchild isn't even born yet.\n\nBut the parents also have their own lives to pursue. The mother mentioned she wishes she had an abortion, implying that having a child wasn't ideal for them. Now they want to focus on their own goals. They're not refusing to spend time with the grandkids entirely, just clarifying they won't be the primary caregivers or provide on-demand help.\n\nCultural norms might play a role here. In some families, grandparents are expected to help, but it's not a universal expectation. The key is whether the parents communicated their boundaries respectfully. The mother's statement about not being taken advantage of is valid, but the son's reaction suggests he felt blindsided.\n\nI think the parents are in the right to set these limits. They're not refusing to be part of their grandchildren's lives, just not taking on the role of primary caregivers. The issue might be more about communication and managing expectations. The parents might need to work on explaining their reasons more sensitively, but they aren't in the wrong for having these boundaries.\n"
