We had our son young (16 and 18), and I have to be honest: there were many years where my wife admitted to me that she wishes she had an abortion rather than going through with the pregnancy. Having kids was never her life's dream, and having our son kept us back in life and kept us from accomplishing a lot of things we wanted to accomplish. Now, don't get me wrong. We love our son fully, we did everything we could to provide a warm, loving home for him. I worked my ass off to help put him through college with little debt. His mom was the picture perfect wife and mother, baking cookies with him, doing art projects, attending every single basketball game, every band concert, every play. We both did these things without ever complaining, and really cherished many of those moments.\n\nWell, my son turned out to be a great young man. He graduated with a nice science degree, met a wonderful woman who he dated for 7 years before marrying. They have been married for two years and have decided to expand their family by having a child. She's pregnant, due in May.\n\nMy wife and I have figured for a while that our \"job\" was done, and that we could finally focus on OUR lives and OUR wants and needs. These include many things like certifications and classes, travel, hobbies. All of the things we had to put on hold while we focused on raising our son. Finally, it was OUR time.\n\nWell, when my son and DIL were over a few weeks ago, shit kind of hit the fan. They were talking about different things they were looking forward to, and my son made a joke, saying, \"And of course, I'm sure we'll look forward to dropping the kids off at Grandma and Grandpa's house every now and then.\"\n\nI laughed it off for a moment, but said, \"I wouldn't count on that.\"\n\nHe got confused and asked what I meant, and I ended up having to tell him rather plainly that he shouldn't expect me and his mother to act as babysitters for his grandchildren. That we'd raised one child, and we were done and happy to focus on us, our lives, etc. My son was visibly upset by this, and said \"But you're going to be grandparents. Shouldn't you WANT to spend time with your grandkids?\"\n\nMy wife spoke up and said that yes, we would be happy to spend time with them, but that we weren't going to be babysitters, we wouldn't be raising them, we would spend them with the *family*, not *just* the grandkids -- we would not be free daycare or babysitting, we would not be taking them on trips, spoiling them, etc. She made a point to say, \"I'm sorry if this isn't what you expected. We will of course be a part of their lives, but we aren't here to be taken advantage of. Your children aren't our responsibility. We don't have a choice if you have them or not. It's your life and your choice, but please don't expect us to sacrifice ours.\"\n\nWell, it all blew up. My son said he just assumed all parents were dying for the moment when they had grandkids, that there's something wrong with us, he can't believe he'd be so cold to our (not even born yet) grandchild, etc etc. \n\nSo I have to ask. Am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their son and daughter-in-law that they shouldn't expect to be babysitters for their grandkids.\n\nFirst, the situation: The parents had a son young, which impacted their own goals and aspirations. Now, their son is getting a child, and they set clear boundaries about not being available for babysitting. The son took it as cold and unexpected. The parents explain they want to focus on their own lives, certifications, travel, etc.\n\nThe key points here are boundaries, expectations, and communication. The parents are not saying they won't spend time with the grandkids, but they're setting limits on being responsible for childcare. They mention they will be part of the grandkids' lives but not as primary caregivers. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, there's no obligation for grandparents to babysit. It's a personal choice. The parents are asserting their right to prioritize their own needs. However, family dynamics can be complex. The son's reaction suggests he had different expectations, possibly influenced by cultural norms or past experiences where grandparents were more involved.\n\nThe parents communicated their stance upfront, which is important to avoid future misunderstandings. The son's frustration might stem from assuming his parents would follow a traditional role. The parents, on the other hand, have legitimate reasons related to their past sacrifices and current goals. \n\nIt's also worth considering if there was a lack of empathy from either side. The parents might have anticipated the son's feelings and could have approached it more sensitively. However, the core issue is about setting boundaries, which is their right.\n\nIn conclusion, the parents are not in the wrong for establishing these boundaries. They are making a choice to focus on their own lives post-child-rearing, and it's valid for them to communicate this clearly. The son's assumption about grandparent roles might be the issue here, not the parents' decision.\n"
