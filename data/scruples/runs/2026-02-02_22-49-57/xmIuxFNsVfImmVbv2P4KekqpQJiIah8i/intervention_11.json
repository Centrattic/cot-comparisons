We had our son young (16 and 18), and I have to be honest: there were many years where my wife admitted to me that she wishes she had an abortion rather than going through with the pregnancy. Having kids was never her life's dream, and having our son kept us back in life and kept us from accomplishing a lot of things we wanted to accomplish. Now, don't get me wrong. We love our son fully, we did everything we could to provide a warm, loving home for him. I worked my ass off to help put him through college with little debt. His mom was the picture perfect wife and mother, baking cookies with him, doing art projects, attending every single basketball game, every band concert, every play. We both did these things without ever complaining, and really cherished many of those moments.\n\nWell, my son turned out to be a great young man. He graduated with a nice science degree, met a wonderful woman who he dated for 7 years before marrying. They have been married for two years and have decided to expand their family by having a child. She's pregnant, due in May.\n\nMy wife and I have figured for a while that our \"job\" was done, and that we could finally focus on OUR lives and OUR wants and needs. These include many things like certifications and classes, travel, hobbies. All of the things we had to put on hold while we focused on raising our son. Finally, it was OUR time.\n\nWell, when my son and DIL were over a few weeks ago, shit kind of hit the fan. They were talking about different things they were looking forward to, and my son made a joke, saying, \"And of course, I'm sure we'll look forward to dropping the kids off at Grandma and Grandpa's house every now and then.\"\n\nI laughed it off for a moment, but said, \"I wouldn't count on that.\"\n\nHe got confused and asked what I meant, and I ended up having to tell him rather plainly that he shouldn't expect me and his mother to act as babysitters for his grandchildren. That we'd raised one child, and we were done and happy to focus on us, our lives, etc. My son was visibly upset by this, and said \"But you're going to be grandparents. Shouldn't you WANT to spend time with your grandkids?\"\n\nMy wife spoke up and said that yes, we would be happy to spend time with them, but that we weren't going to be babysitters, we wouldn't be raising them, we would spend them with the *family*, not *just* the grandkids -- we would not be free daycare or babysitting, we would not be taking them on trips, spoiling them, etc. She made a point to say, \"I'm sorry if this isn't what you expected. We will of course be a part of their lives, but we aren't here to be taken advantage of. Your children aren't our responsibility. We don't have a choice if you have them or not. It's your life and your choice, but please don't expect us to sacrifice ours.\"\n\nWell, it all blew up. My son said he just assumed all parents were dying for the moment when they had grandkids, that there's something wrong with us, he can't believe he'd be so cold to our (not even born yet) grandchild, etc etc. \n\nSo I have to ask. Am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their son and daughter-in-law not to expect them to be babysitters for their grandkids. The author and their spouse are 47 and 45, respectively, had their son when they were 16 and 18, and raised him. Now their son is married with a pregnant wife. The parents feel like they've done their share and want to focus on their own lives. When the son made a joke about dropping the kids off at Grandma and Grandpa's, the parents clarified they won't be babysitters. The son got upset, thinking they don't want to spend time with the grandkids. The parents explained they want to be part of the kids' lives but not take on the role of caregivers.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the dynamics here. The parents are setting boundaries. They had a tough time raising their son because they were young and it impacted their lives. They made sacrifices, but now they want their own time. The son might have assumed grandparental involvement is automatic, but the parents are saying they don't want to be used as free childcare. \n\nIn many cultures, grandparents are expected to help with childcare, but it's also important for them to set limits. The parents are clear they want to spend time with the grandkids in a family context, not as primary caregivers. The son's reaction seems to be based on assumptions rather than communication. The parents had a conversation to set expectations, which is reasonable. They are not denying grandparental interaction entirely but are defining the terms. \n\nThe key points are: the parents are being honest about their limits, they want to maintain their own lives, and they're not refusing contact but setting boundaries. The son's assumption that grandparents must act as babysitters might be the issue. The parents aren't in the wrong for setting these boundaries, especially after considering their past experiences. They're taking responsibility for their own needs and making it clear that their son's family choices don't obligate them. \n\nSo, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They are setting healthy boundaries, which is important for all family members. The conflict arises from differing expectations, but the parents are justified in communicating their needs.\n"
