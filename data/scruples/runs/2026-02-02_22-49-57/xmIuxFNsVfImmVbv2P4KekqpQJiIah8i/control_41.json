We had our son young (16 and 18), and I have to be honest: there were many years where my wife admitted to me that she wishes she had an abortion rather than going through with the pregnancy. Having kids was never her life's dream, and having our son kept us back in life and kept us from accomplishing a lot of things we wanted to accomplish. Now, don't get me wrong. We love our son fully, we did everything we could to provide a warm, loving home for him. I worked my ass off to help put him through college with little debt. His mom was the picture perfect wife and mother, baking cookies with him, doing art projects, attending every single basketball game, every band concert, every play. We both did these things without ever complaining, and really cherished many of those moments.\n\nWell, my son turned out to be a great young man. He graduated with a nice science degree, met a wonderful woman who he dated for 7 years before marrying. They have been married for two years and have decided to expand their family by having a child. She's pregnant, due in May.\n\nMy wife and I have figured for a while that our \"job\" was done, and that we could finally focus on OUR lives and OUR wants and needs. These include many things like certifications and classes, travel, hobbies. All of the things we had to put on hold while we focused on raising our son. Finally, it was OUR time.\n\nWell, when my son and DIL were over a few weeks ago, shit kind of hit the fan. They were talking about different things they were looking forward to, and my son made a joke, saying, \"And of course, I'm sure we'll look forward to dropping the kids off at Grandma and Grandpa's house every now and then.\"\n\nI laughed it off for a moment, but said, \"I wouldn't count on that.\"\n\nHe got confused and asked what I meant, and I ended up having to tell him rather plainly that he shouldn't expect me and his mother to act as babysitters for his grandchildren. That we'd raised one child, and we were done and happy to focus on us, our lives, etc. My son was visibly upset by this, and said \"But you're going to be grandparents. Shouldn't you WANT to spend time with your grandkids?\"\n\nMy wife spoke up and said that yes, we would be happy to spend time with them, but that we weren't going to be babysitters, we wouldn't be raising them, we would spend them with the *family*, not *just* the grandkids -- we would not be free daycare or babysitting, we would not be taking them on trips, spoiling them, etc. She made a point to say, \"I'm sorry if this isn't what you expected. We will of course be a part of their lives, but we aren't here to be taken advantage of. Your children aren't our responsibility. We don't have a choice if you have them or not. It's your life and your choice, but please don't expect us to sacrifice ours.\"\n\nWell, it all blew up. My son said he just assumed all parents were dying for the moment when they had grandkids, that there's something wrong with us, he can't believe he'd be so cold to our (not even born yet) grandchild, etc etc. \n\nSo I have to ask. Am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the person (the father and his wife) told their son and daughter-in-law that they don't want to be babysitters for their future grandchildren. The son got upset because he thought being a grandparent means you automatically want to help out with babysitting. The parents argue that they had to put their lives on hold for their son and now want to focus on their own goals and travel, etc. They made it clear they'll spend time with the grandkids but not be responsible for them.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider cultural norms. In some families, grandparents are expected to help with childcare, but in others, it's not the case. The parents here made their stance clear before the grandchild was even born, which is important. They also mention that they didn't have kids by choice, but there were sacrifices involved. They love their son and did their best, but now they're setting boundaries.\n\nThe son's reaction is that he assumed his parents would be eager to help, which might be a common assumption, but does that make the parents wrong? The parents are setting boundaries to protect their own lives. They\u2019re not refusing to spend time with the kids, just not being full-time caregivers. That seems reasonable. The son might not have considered that his parents have their own plans and didn't sign up for another child. It's possible that the parents are just asserting their right to have their own priorities now.\n\nOn the other hand, the son might feel blindsided because it's a big shift from the typical grandparent role. But the parents did explain their reasoning. There's no indication that they're being cruel or selfish; they\u2019re just stating their limits. The key point is that they\u2019re not refusing to be part of the grandkids' lives but setting clear expectations. So, is it wrong to set those boundaries? Probably not. They have the right to decide how they want to engage with their grandchildren. The son's assumption that all grandparents will help might not hold universally. The parents are just being honest about their desires now. So, the answer might be B (not in the wrong).\n"
