We had our son young (16 and 18), and I have to be honest: there were many years where my wife admitted to me that she wishes she had an abortion rather than going through with the pregnancy. Having kids was never her life's dream, and having our son kept us back in life and kept us from accomplishing a lot of things we wanted to accomplish. Now, don't get me wrong. We love our son fully, we did everything we could to provide a warm, loving home for him. I worked my ass off to help put him through college with little debt. His mom was the picture perfect wife and mother, baking cookies with him, doing art projects, attending every single basketball game, every band concert, every play. We both did these things without ever complaining, and really cherished many of those moments.\n\nWell, my son turned out to be a great young man. He graduated with a nice science degree, met a wonderful woman who he dated for 7 years before marrying. They have been married for two years and have decided to expand their family by having a child. She's pregnant, due in May.\n\nMy wife and I have figured for a while that our \"job\" was done, and that we could finally focus on OUR lives and OUR wants and needs. These include many things like certifications and classes, travel, hobbies. All of the things we had to put on hold while we focused on raising our son. Finally, it was OUR time.\n\nWell, when my son and DIL were over a few weeks ago, shit kind of hit the fan. They were talking about different things they were looking forward to, and my son made a joke, saying, \"And of course, I'm sure we'll look forward to dropping the kids off at Grandma and Grandpa's house every now and then.\"\n\nI laughed it off for a moment, but said, \"I wouldn't count on that.\"\n\nHe got confused and asked what I meant, and I ended up having to tell him rather plainly that he shouldn't expect me and his mother to act as babysitters for his grandchildren. That we'd raised one child, and we were done and happy to focus on us, our lives, etc. My son was visibly upset by this, and said \"But you're going to be grandparents. Shouldn't you WANT to spend time with your grandkids?\"\n\nMy wife spoke up and said that yes, we would be happy to spend time with them, but that we weren't going to be babysitters, we wouldn't be raising them, we would spend them with the *family*, not *just* the grandkids -- we would not be free daycare or babysitting, we would not be taking them on trips, spoiling them, etc. She made a point to say, \"I'm sorry if this isn't what you expected. We will of course be a part of their lives, but we aren't here to be taken advantage of. Your children aren't our responsibility. We don't have a choice if you have them or not. It's your life and your choice, but please don't expect us to sacrifice ours.\"\n\nWell, it all blew up. My son said he just assumed all parents were dying for the moment when they had grandkids, that there's something wrong with us, he can't believe he'd be so cold to our (not even born yet) grandchild, etc etc. \n\nSo I have to ask. Am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out whether the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a parent who had their son at a young age (16 and 18). They mention that having kids wasn't their wife's dream and that it held them back from doing things they wanted. Now their son is getting a child, and they made it clear they won't be babysitters. The son and daughter-in-law expected them to help, but the parents said no. The son is upset, thinking they should be excited about grandkids. The parents clarify they want to spend time with the kids but not as free daycare. They want to focus on their own lives now.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. They had a tough time with their son, especially the mother who felt like she wanted an abortion. They missed out on their own goals and plans. Now that the son is grown, they feel it's their time to focus on themselves. It's reasonable for them to set boundaries. People have different expectations, and it's their choice how they want to live their lives post-retirement or post-children.\n\nOn the other hand, the son's reaction is about expectations. He assumed that all grandparents would want to spend time with their grandchildren, which is a common social expectation. However, the parents are clarifying that they don't want to be responsible for childcare again. The son might feel hurt or rejected because it's a common belief that grandparents naturally want to help. But the parents are not refusing all interaction; they want to be part of their lives without being the primary caregivers.\n\nIs it the parents' fault? Well, setting boundaries isn't wrong. People can have different needs. The parents are being honest about their limitations. They aren't refusing to see the grandkids, just not taking on the role of babysitters. The son's assumption might be based on societal norms, but the parents have the right to decide how they want to engage. The parents also made it clear they would spend time with the family, not just the kids, so there's a balance.\n\nHowever, maybe the parents could have approached it more sensitively. Telling the son outright that they won't be babysitters might have been a shock. Perhaps they should have discussed it earlier or framed it more positively. But the core issue is their right to set boundaries. The parents aren't being selfish if they explain their reasoning and offer to be part of the grandkids' lives without taking on childcare duties.\n\nIn conclusion, the parents are not in the wrong. They have valid reasons based on their past experiences and current desires. They are setting clear expectations, which is important for healthy relationships. The son might need to adjust his expectations, but the parents are not wrong for doing so."
