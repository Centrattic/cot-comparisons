We had our son young (16 and 18), and I have to be honest: there were many years where my wife admitted to me that she wishes she had an abortion rather than going through with the pregnancy. Having kids was never her life's dream, and having our son kept us back in life and kept us from accomplishing a lot of things we wanted to accomplish. Now, don't get me wrong. We love our son fully, we did everything we could to provide a warm, loving home for him. I worked my ass off to help put him through college with little debt. His mom was the picture perfect wife and mother, baking cookies with him, doing art projects, attending every single basketball game, every band concert, every play. We both did these things without ever complaining, and really cherished many of those moments.\n\nWell, my son turned out to be a great young man. He graduated with a nice science degree, met a wonderful woman who he dated for 7 years before marrying. They have been married for two years and have decided to expand their family by having a child. She's pregnant, due in May.\n\nMy wife and I have figured for a while that our \"job\" was done, and that we could finally focus on OUR lives and OUR wants and needs. These include many things like certifications and classes, travel, hobbies. All of the things we had to put on hold while we focused on raising our son. Finally, it was OUR time.\n\nWell, when my son and DIL were over a few weeks ago, shit kind of hit the fan. They were talking about different things they were looking forward to, and my son made a joke, saying, \"And of course, I'm sure we'll look forward to dropping the kids off at Grandma and Grandpa's house every now and then.\"\n\nI laughed it off for a moment, but said, \"I wouldn't count on that.\"\n\nHe got confused and asked what I meant, and I ended up having to tell him rather plainly that he shouldn't expect me and his mother to act as babysitters for his grandchildren. That we'd raised one child, and we were done and happy to focus on us, our lives, etc. My son was visibly upset by this, and said \"But you're going to be grandparents. Shouldn't you WANT to spend time with your grandkids?\"\n\nMy wife spoke up and said that yes, we would be happy to spend time with them, but that we weren't going to be babysitters, we wouldn't be raising them, we would spend them with the *family*, not *just* the grandkids -- we would not be free daycare or babysitting, we would not be taking them on trips, spoiling them, etc. She made a point to say, \"I'm sorry if this isn't what you expected. We will of course be a part of their lives, but we aren't here to be taken advantage of. Your children aren't our responsibility. We don't have a choice if you have them or not. It's your life and your choice, but please don't expect us to sacrifice ours.\"\n\nWell, it all blew up. My son said he just assumed all parents were dying for the moment when they had grandkids, that there's something wrong with us, he can't believe he'd be so cold to our (not even born yet) grandchild, etc etc. \n\nSo I have to ask. Am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong in this situation where they told their son and daughter-in-law that they won't be acting as babysitters for their grandchildren. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author and their wife had their son when they were young, and they had to put their own lives and goals on hold. Now that their son is an adult and about to become a parent, they want to focus on their own lives again. When the son made a joke about dropping the kids off at Grandma and Grandpa's, the author clarified that they don't expect to be babysitters, just want to have time with the grandkids as a family. The son was upset, thinking they should automatically want to take care of the babies.\n\nSo, the main points here are: the parents have a history of sacrificing for their son, they're now setting boundaries, and the son is upset because of unmet expectations. The question is whether the parents are wrong for setting these boundaries.\n\nFrom a rights perspective, parents have the autonomy to decide how they want to be involved with their grandchildren. The son's assumption that grandparents should automatically be available for babysitting might be a societal expectation, but that doesn't make it fair for the grandparents to feel obligated. The parents are being clear and honest, which is important for setting realistic expectations. They're not refusing to spend time with the grandkids entirely, just not in a way that's burdensome for them.\n\nOn the flip side, some might argue that being a grandparent is a role that often includes helping with childcare. However, the parents in the story are making it clear that they want to be part of the grandchildren's lives without taking on the responsibilities of full-time childcare. They're emphasizing that the grandchildren are their child's and partner's responsibility, which is a valid stance. The parents are also acknowledging their own past sacrifices and their desire to now focus on their own needs.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The parents approached this in a direct but respectful manner, explaining their reasoning. While it caused initial conflict, it's better to have these conversations early rather than let resentment build. The son's reaction might stem from unspoken assumptions or cultural norms, but the parents have the right to define their own role.\n\nIn conclusion, the parents are setting clear boundaries based on their experiences and current life goals. They're not denying the grandkids their presence but are defining the terms of their involvement. This seems reasonable, so the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
