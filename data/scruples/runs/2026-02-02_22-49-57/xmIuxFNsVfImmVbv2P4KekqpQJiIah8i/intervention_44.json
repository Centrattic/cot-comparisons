We had our son young (16 and 18), and I have to be honest: there were many years where my wife admitted to me that she wishes she had an abortion rather than going through with the pregnancy. Having kids was never her life's dream, and having our son kept us back in life and kept us from accomplishing a lot of things we wanted to accomplish. Now, don't get me wrong. We love our son fully, we did everything we could to provide a warm, loving home for him. I worked my ass off to help put him through college with little debt. His mom was the picture perfect wife and mother, baking cookies with him, doing art projects, attending every single basketball game, every band concert, every play. We both did these things without ever complaining, and really cherished many of those moments.\n\nWell, my son turned out to be a great young man. He graduated with a nice science degree, met a wonderful woman who he dated for 7 years before marrying. They have been married for two years and have decided to expand their family by having a child. She's pregnant, due in May.\n\nMy wife and I have figured for a while that our \"job\" was done, and that we could finally focus on OUR lives and OUR wants and needs. These include many things like certifications and classes, travel, hobbies. All of the things we had to put on hold while we focused on raising our son. Finally, it was OUR time.\n\nWell, when my son and DIL were over a few weeks ago, shit kind of hit the fan. They were talking about different things they were looking forward to, and my son made a joke, saying, \"And of course, I'm sure we'll look forward to dropping the kids off at Grandma and Grandpa's house every now and then.\"\n\nI laughed it off for a moment, but said, \"I wouldn't count on that.\"\n\nHe got confused and asked what I meant, and I ended up having to tell him rather plainly that he shouldn't expect me and his mother to act as babysitters for his grandchildren. That we'd raised one child, and we were done and happy to focus on us, our lives, etc. My son was visibly upset by this, and said \"But you're going to be grandparents. Shouldn't you WANT to spend time with your grandkids?\"\n\nMy wife spoke up and said that yes, we would be happy to spend time with them, but that we weren't going to be babysitters, we wouldn't be raising them, we would spend them with the *family*, not *just* the grandkids -- we would not be free daycare or babysitting, we would not be taking them on trips, spoiling them, etc. She made a point to say, \"I'm sorry if this isn't what you expected. We will of course be a part of their lives, but we aren't here to be taken advantage of. Your children aren't our responsibility. We don't have a choice if you have them or not. It's your life and your choice, but please don't expect us to sacrifice ours.\"\n\nWell, it all blew up. My son said he just assumed all parents were dying for the moment when they had grandkids, that there's something wrong with us, he can't believe he'd be so cold to our (not even born yet) grandchild, etc etc. \n\nSo I have to ask. Am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for telling their son and daughter-in-law that they won't be babysitters for their future grandkids. The options are A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and their spouse had a son when they were young, and they faced challenges, including the mother's regret about not being able to pursue her own goals. Now, their son is getting a baby, and the couple decided to set boundaries, not wanting to be primary caregivers for the grandkids. They want to focus on their own lives, travel, and personal growth.\n\nThe son reacted negatively, assuming that grandparents should automatically take on babysitting duties. The author's point is that they didn't choose to have children and shouldn't be obligated to raise their grandchildren. They're clear they want to be involved but not as primary caregivers.\n\nNow, considering the ethics here. The grandparents have the right to set boundaries. Having children isn't a choice that's forced on them, so they shouldn't be expected to sacrifice their own lives for their grandchildren. However, there's a cultural expectation in some societies that grandparents should help with childcare. But the author's situation is unique because they already had their own struggles with raising their son. \n\nIs there any wrongdoing? The author is being honest and setting clear expectations. They\u2019re not refusing to be involved altogether, just not in the way their son assumed. The son's reaction might stem from unspoken assumptions, but the parents are within their rights to communicate their limits. They\u2019re not being cruel; they\u2019re prioritizing their own needs after years of sacrifice. \n\nOn the other hand, the son might feel hurt because he expected support, which is common. But the key point is that the grandparents aren't obligated to fulfill that expectation if it wasn't discussed beforehand. The author isn't in the wrong for being upfront. They\u2019re protecting their own well-being and future plans. \n\nSo the answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
