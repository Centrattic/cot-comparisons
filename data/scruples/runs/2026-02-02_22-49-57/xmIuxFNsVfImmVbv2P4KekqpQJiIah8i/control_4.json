We had our son young (16 and 18), and I have to be honest: there were many years where my wife admitted to me that she wishes she had an abortion rather than going through with the pregnancy. Having kids was never her life's dream, and having our son kept us back in life and kept us from accomplishing a lot of things we wanted to accomplish. Now, don't get me wrong. We love our son fully, we did everything we could to provide a warm, loving home for him. I worked my ass off to help put him through college with little debt. His mom was the picture perfect wife and mother, baking cookies with him, doing art projects, attending every single basketball game, every band concert, every play. We both did these things without ever complaining, and really cherished many of those moments.\n\nWell, my son turned out to be a great young man. He graduated with a nice science degree, met a wonderful woman who he dated for 7 years before marrying. They have been married for two years and have decided to expand their family by having a child. She's pregnant, due in May.\n\nMy wife and I have figured for a while that our \"job\" was done, and that we could finally focus on OUR lives and OUR wants and needs. These include many things like certifications and classes, travel, hobbies. All of the things we had to put on hold while we focused on raising our son. Finally, it was OUR time.\n\nWell, when my son and DIL were over a few weeks ago, shit kind of hit the fan. They were talking about different things they were looking forward to, and my son made a joke, saying, \"And of course, I'm sure we'll look forward to dropping the kids off at Grandma and Grandpa's house every now and then.\"\n\nI laughed it off for a moment, but said, \"I wouldn't count on that.\"\n\nHe got confused and asked what I meant, and I ended up having to tell him rather plainly that he shouldn't expect me and his mother to act as babysitters for his grandchildren. That we'd raised one child, and we were done and happy to focus on us, our lives, etc. My son was visibly upset by this, and said \"But you're going to be grandparents. Shouldn't you WANT to spend time with your grandkids?\"\n\nMy wife spoke up and said that yes, we would be happy to spend time with them, but that we weren't going to be babysitters, we wouldn't be raising them, we would spend them with the *family*, not *just* the grandkids -- we would not be free daycare or babysitting, we would not be taking them on trips, spoiling them, etc. She made a point to say, \"I'm sorry if this isn't what you expected. We will of course be a part of their lives, but we aren't here to be taken advantage of. Your children aren't our responsibility. We don't have a choice if you have them or not. It's your life and your choice, but please don't expect us to sacrifice ours.\"\n\nWell, it all blew up. My son said he just assumed all parents were dying for the moment when they had grandkids, that there's something wrong with us, he can't believe he'd be so cold to our (not even born yet) grandchild, etc etc. \n\nSo I have to ask. Am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the original poster (OP) is in the wrong. The situation is that the OP, along with their spouse, told their son and daughter-in-law they wouldn't be acting as babysitters for their future grandchildren. The son was upset, thinking grandparents should naturally want to babysit. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The OP had their son young, which had a big impact on their lives. The wife wasn't personally enthusiastic about having kids, but they both worked hard to provide for their son. Now they feel it's their time to focus on their own goals and interests.\n\nThe main issue here is setting boundaries. The grandparents are asserting that they won't be responsible for babysitting, which the son and daughter-in-law might have assumed was the norm. The son's reaction suggests he had different expectations, possibly based on cultural or family norms where grandparents are expected to help with childcare.\n\nBut from a fairness standpoint, the grandparents are making their expectations clear before the grandkids are even born. They're not refusing all interaction but clarifying that they won't take on the role of primary caregivers. The wife specifically says they want to be part of the kids' lives but not in a way that sacrifices their own lives.\n\nThe son's assumption that grandparents should automatically want to be babysitters might be the problem here. Not all grandparents have the desire or capacity to take on that role, especially if they have their own goals. The OP's communication, though direct, seems reasonable to set boundaries early.\n\nI need to check if there's any cultural or normative aspect where being a babysitter is expected. In some cultures, extended family is more involved in childcare. However, the OP's situation involves their personal history and sacrifices, which might justify their stance. They're not refusing all time but setting limits.\n\nThe key points are: setting boundaries, clear communication, and mutual respect. The OP isn't being unreasonable by stating their needs. The son's upset reaction might stem from unspoken expectations, but the grandparents have a right to prioritize their own lives now.\n\nSo, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong). They're asserting their boundaries, which is a responsible approach to avoid future resentment.\n"
