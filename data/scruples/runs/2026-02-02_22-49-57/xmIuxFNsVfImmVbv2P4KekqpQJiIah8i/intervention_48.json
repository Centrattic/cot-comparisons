We had our son young (16 and 18), and I have to be honest: there were many years where my wife admitted to me that she wishes she had an abortion rather than going through with the pregnancy. Having kids was never her life's dream, and having our son kept us back in life and kept us from accomplishing a lot of things we wanted to accomplish. Now, don't get me wrong. We love our son fully, we did everything we could to provide a warm, loving home for him. I worked my ass off to help put him through college with little debt. His mom was the picture perfect wife and mother, baking cookies with him, doing art projects, attending every single basketball game, every band concert, every play. We both did these things without ever complaining, and really cherished many of those moments.\n\nWell, my son turned out to be a great young man. He graduated with a nice science degree, met a wonderful woman who he dated for 7 years before marrying. They have been married for two years and have decided to expand their family by having a child. She's pregnant, due in May.\n\nMy wife and I have figured for a while that our \"job\" was done, and that we could finally focus on OUR lives and OUR wants and needs. These include many things like certifications and classes, travel, hobbies. All of the things we had to put on hold while we focused on raising our son. Finally, it was OUR time.\n\nWell, when my son and DIL were over a few weeks ago, shit kind of hit the fan. They were talking about different things they were looking forward to, and my son made a joke, saying, \"And of course, I'm sure we'll look forward to dropping the kids off at Grandma and Grandpa's house every now and then.\"\n\nI laughed it off for a moment, but said, \"I wouldn't count on that.\"\n\nHe got confused and asked what I meant, and I ended up having to tell him rather plainly that he shouldn't expect me and his mother to act as babysitters for his grandchildren. That we'd raised one child, and we were done and happy to focus on us, our lives, etc. My son was visibly upset by this, and said \"But you're going to be grandparents. Shouldn't you WANT to spend time with your grandkids?\"\n\nMy wife spoke up and said that yes, we would be happy to spend time with them, but that we weren't going to be babysitters, we wouldn't be raising them, we would spend them with the *family*, not *just* the grandkids -- we would not be free daycare or babysitting, we would not be taking them on trips, spoiling them, etc. She made a point to say, \"I'm sorry if this isn't what you expected. We will of course be a part of their lives, but we aren't here to be taken advantage of. Your children aren't our responsibility. We don't have a choice if you have them or not. It's your life and your choice, but please don't expect us to sacrifice ours.\"\n\nWell, it all blew up. My son said he just assumed all parents were dying for the moment when they had grandkids, that there's something wrong with us, he can't believe he'd be so cold to our (not even born yet) grandchild, etc etc. \n\nSo I have to ask. Am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the given story is in the wrong for telling their son and daughter-in-law not to expect them to be babysitters for the grandkids. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The parents had their son at a young age, which affected their ability to pursue their own goals. They worked hard to raise him, but it wasn't their initial plan\u2014especially the mother, who expressed regret. Now, with their son married and expecting a child, they want to focus on their own lives again. When the son jokes about dropping the kids off at grandparents' for babysitting, the parents clarify that they won't be acting as babysitters, emphasizing that they want to spend time with the family, not just the grandkids, and that they won't sacrifice their own plans.\n\nThe son reacts negatively, assuming that being grandparents means they'd automatically be available for childcare. The parents are pushing back against that assumption. \n\nSo, the key points here are the parents' right to set boundaries, their past experiences (including the mother's regret about not being able to pursue her dreams), and the son's expectations based on traditional roles. \n\nI should consider cultural norms. In many cultures, grandparents are expected to help with childcare, but that's changing as people become more aware of the need for boundaries. The parents here are clear that they don't want to be the default babysitters. They're not refusing to have any contact with the grandkids, just not taking on the role of primary childcare providers. \n\nThe parents also mention they want to be part of the grandkids' lives but on their own terms. They\u2019re making it clear that they won\u2019t sacrifice their own needs and plans. The son\u2019s reaction might stem from unspoken expectations rather than the parents having malicious intent. \n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the parents have a right to their own lives. They've already raised a child, contributed financially to their son's education, and now they're in a position to make their own choices. The son's assumption that his parents would automatically help is perhaps based on traditional gender roles or a lack of communication about boundaries. \n\nThe mother's statement that they aren't here to be \"taken advantage of\" is a strong boundary, which is valid. They\u2019re not being selfish; they\u2019re asserting their autonomy. The son might not have considered that his parents might have different priorities now. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the parents are not acting wrongfully. They\u2019re setting clear boundaries and communicating their expectations. The son\u2019s reaction could be due to unmet expectations rather than the parents being in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be B\u2014No, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
