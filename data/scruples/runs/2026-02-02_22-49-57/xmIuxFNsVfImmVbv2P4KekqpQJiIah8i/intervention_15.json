We had our son young (16 and 18), and I have to be honest: there were many years where my wife admitted to me that she wishes she had an abortion rather than going through with the pregnancy. Having kids was never her life's dream, and having our son kept us back in life and kept us from accomplishing a lot of things we wanted to accomplish. Now, don't get me wrong. We love our son fully, we did everything we could to provide a warm, loving home for him. I worked my ass off to help put him through college with little debt. His mom was the picture perfect wife and mother, baking cookies with him, doing art projects, attending every single basketball game, every band concert, every play. We both did these things without ever complaining, and really cherished many of those moments.\n\nWell, my son turned out to be a great young man. He graduated with a nice science degree, met a wonderful woman who he dated for 7 years before marrying. They have been married for two years and have decided to expand their family by having a child. She's pregnant, due in May.\n\nMy wife and I have figured for a while that our \"job\" was done, and that we could finally focus on OUR lives and OUR wants and needs. These include many things like certifications and classes, travel, hobbies. All of the things we had to put on hold while we focused on raising our son. Finally, it was OUR time.\n\nWell, when my son and DIL were over a few weeks ago, shit kind of hit the fan. They were talking about different things they were looking forward to, and my son made a joke, saying, \"And of course, I'm sure we'll look forward to dropping the kids off at Grandma and Grandpa's house every now and then.\"\n\nI laughed it off for a moment, but said, \"I wouldn't count on that.\"\n\nHe got confused and asked what I meant, and I ended up having to tell him rather plainly that he shouldn't expect me and his mother to act as babysitters for his grandchildren. That we'd raised one child, and we were done and happy to focus on us, our lives, etc. My son was visibly upset by this, and said \"But you're going to be grandparents. Shouldn't you WANT to spend time with your grandkids?\"\n\nMy wife spoke up and said that yes, we would be happy to spend time with them, but that we weren't going to be babysitters, we wouldn't be raising them, we would spend them with the *family*, not *just* the grandkids -- we would not be free daycare or babysitting, we would not be taking them on trips, spoiling them, etc. She made a point to say, \"I'm sorry if this isn't what you expected. We will of course be a part of their lives, but we aren't here to be taken advantage of. Your children aren't our responsibility. We don't have a choice if you have them or not. It's your life and your choice, but please don't expect us to sacrifice ours.\"\n\nWell, it all blew up. My son said he just assumed all parents were dying for the moment when they had grandkids, that there's something wrong with us, he can't believe he'd be so cold to our (not even born yet) grandchild, etc etc. \n\nSo I have to ask. Am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The scenario is about the author and their spouse telling their son and daughter-in-law that they won't be acting as babysitters for their grandchildren. The son is upset, thinking grandparents should naturally want to help, but the parents set boundaries.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context given. The parents had their son young, which limited their ability to pursue their own goals. They mention working hard to support their son through college, and now they feel they've earned the right to focus on their own lives. They clearly state they want to spend time with the grandkids but not take on the role of being free babysitters. \n\nCommon arguments in these situations include the idea that grandparents have a right to expect help, but others might say that parents should have autonomy over their time and energy. The parents here are setting clear boundaries, which is important for their own well-being. They\u2019re not refusing to be part of the grandkids' lives entirely, just not being on call for childcare. \n\nI should think about cultural norms. In some families, grandparents are expected to help with childcare, but it's not a universal expectation. The parents here are communicating their limits early, which is fair. The son's reaction might stem from unspoken assumptions about grandparent roles, but the parents have the right to define their own role. \n\nAlso, the parents mention that having kids wasn't their wife's dream, so they've already made sacrifices. Now they're asserting their choice to prioritize their own lives. It's about mutual respect. The DIL's statement about not being taken advantage of is valid. \n\nPotential counterarguments: Some might say that grandparents should be more flexible, but that's assuming they don't have their own needs. The key here is that the parents are being honest and setting expectations upfront, which is responsible. They\u2019re not denying grandparent time, just refusing to be the default childcare solution. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer is B. The author is not in the wrong. They're making a choice to prioritize their own lives after years of sacrifice, and they're communicating this clearly. The son's surprise suggests perhaps an unrealistic expectation, but the parents have every right to set these boundaries.\n"
