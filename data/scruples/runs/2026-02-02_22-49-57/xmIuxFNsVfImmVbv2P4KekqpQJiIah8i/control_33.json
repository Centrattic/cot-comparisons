We had our son young (16 and 18), and I have to be honest: there were many years where my wife admitted to me that she wishes she had an abortion rather than going through with the pregnancy. Having kids was never her life's dream, and having our son kept us back in life and kept us from accomplishing a lot of things we wanted to accomplish. Now, don't get me wrong. We love our son fully, we did everything we could to provide a warm, loving home for him. I worked my ass off to help put him through college with little debt. His mom was the picture perfect wife and mother, baking cookies with him, doing art projects, attending every single basketball game, every band concert, every play. We both did these things without ever complaining, and really cherished many of those moments.\n\nWell, my son turned out to be a great young man. He graduated with a nice science degree, met a wonderful woman who he dated for 7 years before marrying. They have been married for two years and have decided to expand their family by having a child. She's pregnant, due in May.\n\nMy wife and I have figured for a while that our \"job\" was done, and that we could finally focus on OUR lives and OUR wants and needs. These include many things like certifications and classes, travel, hobbies. All of the things we had to put on hold while we focused on raising our son. Finally, it was OUR time.\n\nWell, when my son and DIL were over a few weeks ago, shit kind of hit the fan. They were talking about different things they were looking forward to, and my son made a joke, saying, \"And of course, I'm sure we'll look forward to dropping the kids off at Grandma and Grandpa's house every now and then.\"\n\nI laughed it off for a moment, but said, \"I wouldn't count on that.\"\n\nHe got confused and asked what I meant, and I ended up having to tell him rather plainly that he shouldn't expect me and his mother to act as babysitters for his grandchildren. That we'd raised one child, and we were done and happy to focus on us, our lives, etc. My son was visibly upset by this, and said \"But you're going to be grandparents. Shouldn't you WANT to spend time with your grandkids?\"\n\nMy wife spoke up and said that yes, we would be happy to spend time with them, but that we weren't going to be babysitters, we wouldn't be raising them, we would spend them with the *family*, not *just* the grandkids -- we would not be free daycare or babysitting, we would not be taking them on trips, spoiling them, etc. She made a point to say, \"I'm sorry if this isn't what you expected. We will of course be a part of their lives, but we aren't here to be taken advantage of. Your children aren't our responsibility. We don't have a choice if you have them or not. It's your life and your choice, but please don't expect us to sacrifice ours.\"\n\nWell, it all blew up. My son said he just assumed all parents were dying for the moment when they had grandkids, that there's something wrong with us, he can't believe he'd be so cold to our (not even born yet) grandchild, etc etc. \n\nSo I have to ask. Am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. So, the user is asking whether the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post is in the wrong. The situation is that they told their son and daughter-in-law (DIL) they wouldn't be babysitters for their grandchildren. The author is a parent who had their son when they were young, and there were years where the wife regretted not having an abortion. They feel like their life was put on hold, and now they want to focus on their own goals like certifications, travel, etc. When the son made a joke about dropping the kids off at Grandma and Grandpa's, the author and wife made it clear they wouldn't be acting as free babysitters. The son was upset, saying he assumed all grandparents wanted to spend time with their grandkids and that they're being cold.\n\nSo, the core issue here is the grandparents' expectations versus the parents' (the author's) boundaries. The author is setting a boundary that they want to be present in the grandkids' lives but not take on the role of primary caregivers or provide unlimited, unsolicited help. On one hand, some might argue that grandparents often naturally want to spend time with their grandchildren and that refusing to be involved could impact the kids' relationship with them. But on the other hand, the author is coming from a place where they had to make significant sacrifices and now want to reclaim their personal time and autonomy. \n\nI need to consider cultural norms here. In many cultures, grandparents are expected to help with childcare, especially in tough times. However, the author is not refusing to spend time with the grandkids; they're just not being available as on-call babysitters. They still want to be part of the grandkids' lives, but perhaps in a more structured or occasional way. The wife's statement about not being taken advantage of and that the grandkids aren't their responsibility seems valid. Parents make choices about their children, and the grandparents shouldn't be forced to sacrifice their lives for that. \n\nThe son's reaction might be based on unspoken assumptions or societal expectations. He might have thought that grandparents naturally want to help as much as possible. But the key is that the author is communicating their own needs and setting boundaries. While it's important to maintain a relationship, it's also important for the grandparents to have their own agency. \n\nSo, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they are asserting their right to set personal boundaries and prioritize their own well-being and goals. It's reasonable for them to not want to be expected to be constant caregivers, especially given their history of personal sacrifices.\n"
