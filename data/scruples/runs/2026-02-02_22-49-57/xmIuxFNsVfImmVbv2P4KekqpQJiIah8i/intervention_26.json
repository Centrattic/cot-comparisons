We had our son young (16 and 18), and I have to be honest: there were many years where my wife admitted to me that she wishes she had an abortion rather than going through with the pregnancy. Having kids was never her life's dream, and having our son kept us back in life and kept us from accomplishing a lot of things we wanted to accomplish. Now, don't get me wrong. We love our son fully, we did everything we could to provide a warm, loving home for him. I worked my ass off to help put him through college with little debt. His mom was the picture perfect wife and mother, baking cookies with him, doing art projects, attending every single basketball game, every band concert, every play. We both did these things without ever complaining, and really cherished many of those moments.\n\nWell, my son turned out to be a great young man. He graduated with a nice science degree, met a wonderful woman who he dated for 7 years before marrying. They have been married for two years and have decided to expand their family by having a child. She's pregnant, due in May.\n\nMy wife and I have figured for a while that our \"job\" was done, and that we could finally focus on OUR lives and OUR wants and needs. These include many things like certifications and classes, travel, hobbies. All of the things we had to put on hold while we focused on raising our son. Finally, it was OUR time.\n\nWell, when my son and DIL were over a few weeks ago, shit kind of hit the fan. They were talking about different things they were looking forward to, and my son made a joke, saying, \"And of course, I'm sure we'll look forward to dropping the kids off at Grandma and Grandpa's house every now and then.\"\n\nI laughed it off for a moment, but said, \"I wouldn't count on that.\"\n\nHe got confused and asked what I meant, and I ended up having to tell him rather plainly that he shouldn't expect me and his mother to act as babysitters for his grandchildren. That we'd raised one child, and we were done and happy to focus on us, our lives, etc. My son was visibly upset by this, and said \"But you're going to be grandparents. Shouldn't you WANT to spend time with your grandkids?\"\n\nMy wife spoke up and said that yes, we would be happy to spend time with them, but that we weren't going to be babysitters, we wouldn't be raising them, we would spend them with the *family*, not *just* the grandkids -- we would not be free daycare or babysitting, we would not be taking them on trips, spoiling them, etc. She made a point to say, \"I'm sorry if this isn't what you expected. We will of course be a part of their lives, but we aren't here to be taken advantage of. Your children aren't our responsibility. We don't have a choice if you have them or not. It's your life and your choice, but please don't expect us to sacrifice ours.\"\n\nWell, it all blew up. My son said he just assumed all parents were dying for the moment when they had grandkids, that there's something wrong with us, he can't believe he'd be so cold to our (not even born yet) grandchild, etc etc. \n\nSo I have to ask. Am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA situation is in the wrong.\n\nSo the situation is about the author (a 47-year-old father) and his wife telling their son and daughter-in-law that they won't be acting as babysitters for their future grandchildren. The son got upset, thinking they should naturally want to spend time with the kids. The parents explain that after raising one child, they want to focus on their own lives now. The son seems to think they're being cold and not as supportive as assumed.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. They had their son young, which affected their lives and their ability to pursue their own goals. They raised him with love but didn't have the life they wanted. Now, they're trying to reclaim their time. They're clear that they want to be involved with their grandkids but not take on the role of primary caregivers. They're setting boundaries to protect their own needs. That seems reasonable. People have the right to set limits, especially if they've already given a lot to their children.\n\nOn the other hand, the son's reaction suggests he had different expectations. Maybe he assumed that being grandparents means being available for babysitting. But that's a common assumption, isn't it? However, the parents are clarifying their stance before the child is even born, which is respectful. They're not saying they won't see the grandkids at all, just that they won't act as free daycare. The son's upset might be because he feels the parents are being dismissive, but the parents are being honest from the start.\n\nIs there any wrongdoing here? The parents are setting boundaries to maintain their own well-being and goals. They\u2019re not denying the child their presence; they\u2019re just not offering to take over childcare responsibilities. It's about mutual respect and understanding each other's expectations. The son might need to adjust his expectations, but the parents aren't wrong for doing this. They\u2019re protecting their own priorities after raising a child. So the answer here is probably B, not in the wrong.\n"
