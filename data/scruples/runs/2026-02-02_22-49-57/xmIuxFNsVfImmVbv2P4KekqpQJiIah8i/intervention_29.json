We had our son young (16 and 18), and I have to be honest: there were many years where my wife admitted to me that she wishes she had an abortion rather than going through with the pregnancy. Having kids was never her life's dream, and having our son kept us back in life and kept us from accomplishing a lot of things we wanted to accomplish. Now, don't get me wrong. We love our son fully, we did everything we could to provide a warm, loving home for him. I worked my ass off to help put him through college with little debt. His mom was the picture perfect wife and mother, baking cookies with him, doing art projects, attending every single basketball game, every band concert, every play. We both did these things without ever complaining, and really cherished many of those moments.\n\nWell, my son turned out to be a great young man. He graduated with a nice science degree, met a wonderful woman who he dated for 7 years before marrying. They have been married for two years and have decided to expand their family by having a child. She's pregnant, due in May.\n\nMy wife and I have figured for a while that our \"job\" was done, and that we could finally focus on OUR lives and OUR wants and needs. These include many things like certifications and classes, travel, hobbies. All of the things we had to put on hold while we focused on raising our son. Finally, it was OUR time.\n\nWell, when my son and DIL were over a few weeks ago, shit kind of hit the fan. They were talking about different things they were looking forward to, and my son made a joke, saying, \"And of course, I'm sure we'll look forward to dropping the kids off at Grandma and Grandpa's house every now and then.\"\n\nI laughed it off for a moment, but said, \"I wouldn't count on that.\"\n\nHe got confused and asked what I meant, and I ended up having to tell him rather plainly that he shouldn't expect me and his mother to act as babysitters for his grandchildren. That we'd raised one child, and we were done and happy to focus on us, our lives, etc. My son was visibly upset by this, and said \"But you're going to be grandparents. Shouldn't you WANT to spend time with your grandkids?\"\n\nMy wife spoke up and said that yes, we would be happy to spend time with them, but that we weren't going to be babysitters, we wouldn't be raising them, we would spend them with the *family*, not *just* the grandkids -- we would not be free daycare or babysitting, we would not be taking them on trips, spoiling them, etc. She made a point to say, \"I'm sorry if this isn't what you expected. We will of course be a part of their lives, but we aren't here to be taken advantage of. Your children aren't our responsibility. We don't have a choice if you have them or not. It's your life and your choice, but please don't expect us to sacrifice ours.\"\n\nWell, it all blew up. My son said he just assumed all parents were dying for the moment when they had grandkids, that there's something wrong with us, he can't believe he'd be so cold to our (not even born yet) grandchild, etc etc. \n\nSo I have to ask. Am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story (the author) is in the wrong for telling their son and daughter-in-law they won't act as babysitters for their grandkids.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The author and their wife are 47 and 45, had their son young (16 and 18), which significantly impacted their lives. They worked hard to provide for their son, but raising a child wasn't their dream. Now, with their son grown up and expecting a child, they want to focus on their own goals and travel. When the son joked about expecting them to be babysitters, the author clarified that they don't want to take on that role. The son was upset, feeling that grandparents should naturally want to spend time with their grandkids, but the author's stance is about not being expected to sacrifice their lives again.\n\nThe key points here are autonomy and boundaries. The author is asserting their right to set boundaries, especially since having kids wasn't their dream and they've already sacrificed a lot. They made it clear they want to be involved but not as primary caregivers. The son's reaction suggests he might have had different expectations, but the author isn't in a position to be expected to fulfill those without prior discussion.\n\nI should consider cultural norms. In many cultures, grandparents are expected to help with childcare, but that's a societal expectation. The author is rejecting that, which some might see as selfish, but others would respect their right to choose. The author isn't refusing to spend time with the grandkids entirely, just not as babysitters or primary caregivers. They still want to be part of the grandkids' lives, which shows they care.\n\nThe son's assumption that all grandparents want to be babysitters might be naive. The author's perspective is valid because they didn't choose to have kids, and they should have the autonomy to decide how they engage with their grandkids. The fact that they're clear and honest, rather than making excuses, shows maturity.\n\nPotential counterarguments: Some might feel that grandparents should be more flexible, especially since they have the experience. However, the author is not denying the grandkids time with them, just setting realistic expectations. Also, the son's comment about \"coldness\" is harsh, as the author is being honest rather than unloving.\n\nIn conclusion, the author is within their rights to set these boundaries. They've explained their reasons, and it's about respecting their own needs after past sacrifices. The answer should be B (not in the wrong).\n"
