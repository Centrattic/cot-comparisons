We had our son young (16 and 18), and I have to be honest: there were many years where my wife admitted to me that she wishes she had an abortion rather than going through with the pregnancy. Having kids was never her life's dream, and having our son kept us back in life and kept us from accomplishing a lot of things we wanted to accomplish. Now, don't get me wrong. We love our son fully, we did everything we could to provide a warm, loving home for him. I worked my ass off to help put him through college with little debt. His mom was the picture perfect wife and mother, baking cookies with him, doing art projects, attending every single basketball game, every band concert, every play. We both did these things without ever complaining, and really cherished many of those moments.\n\nWell, my son turned out to be a great young man. He graduated with a nice science degree, met a wonderful woman who he dated for 7 years before marrying. They have been married for two years and have decided to expand their family by having a child. She's pregnant, due in May.\n\nMy wife and I have figured for a while that our \"job\" was done, and that we could finally focus on OUR lives and OUR wants and needs. These include many things like certifications and classes, travel, hobbies. All of the things we had to put on hold while we focused on raising our son. Finally, it was OUR time.\n\nWell, when my son and DIL were over a few weeks ago, shit kind of hit the fan. They were talking about different things they were looking forward to, and my son made a joke, saying, \"And of course, I'm sure we'll look forward to dropping the kids off at Grandma and Grandpa's house every now and then.\"\n\nI laughed it off for a moment, but said, \"I wouldn't count on that.\"\n\nHe got confused and asked what I meant, and I ended up having to tell him rather plainly that he shouldn't expect me and his mother to act as babysitters for his grandchildren. That we'd raised one child, and we were done and happy to focus on us, our lives, etc. My son was visibly upset by this, and said \"But you're going to be grandparents. Shouldn't you WANT to spend time with your grandkids?\"\n\nMy wife spoke up and said that yes, we would be happy to spend time with them, but that we weren't going to be babysitters, we wouldn't be raising them, we would spend them with the *family*, not *just* the grandkids -- we would not be free daycare or babysitting, we would not be taking them on trips, spoiling them, etc. She made a point to say, \"I'm sorry if this isn't what you expected. We will of course be a part of their lives, but we aren't here to be taken advantage of. Your children aren't our responsibility. We don't have a choice if you have them or not. It's your life and your choice, but please don't expect us to sacrifice ours.\"\n\nWell, it all blew up. My son said he just assumed all parents were dying for the moment when they had grandkids, that there's something wrong with us, he can't believe he'd be so cold to our (not even born yet) grandchild, etc etc. \n\nSo I have to ask. Am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong. The situation is about the author and their wife telling their son and daughter-in-law that they don't want to be babysitters for their future grandchildren. The son is upset because he assumed grandparents would naturally want to help with childcare.\n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author and their wife had a tough time raising their own son when they were young. They had to give up a lot of their own goals and dreams. Now that their son is grown and about to have a child, they want to focus on their own lives, travel, etc. They made it clear that they won't be acting as free babysitters, but they still want to spend time with the grandkids in a family setting.\n\nThe son, on the other hand, felt hurt and confused. He assumed that grandparents would naturally want to help more, maybe expecting them to take over some childcare responsibilities. The conflict arose because of differing expectations. The parents didn't communicate their boundaries earlier, leading to a misunderstanding.\n\nNow, considering societal norms, grandparents often do help with childcare, but it's not a given. People have different expectations and circumstances. The key here is that the author and his wife communicated their stance clearly, without being hostile, but firm. They're not refusing all contact, just setting boundaries. They mentioned they'll be part of the grandkids' lives but not take responsibility for childcare beyond that.\n\nThe son's reaction suggests he had different expectations, which is common. But the parents have the right to prioritize their own needs. They made it clear they won't be sacrificing their lives for their son's family decisions. The question is whether setting those boundaries makes them the asshole. \n\nIn my opinion, parents should be respected for their decision. Just because someone becomes a grandparent doesn't automatically mean they have to become a caregiver. The author's actions are about self-respect and setting healthy boundaries. The son's assumption might be based on cultural expectations, but he needs to respect his parents' choices. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong. They communicated their needs and aren't being cruel, just clear about their limits. The problem is the son's unmet expectations, not the parents being inconsiderate.\n"
