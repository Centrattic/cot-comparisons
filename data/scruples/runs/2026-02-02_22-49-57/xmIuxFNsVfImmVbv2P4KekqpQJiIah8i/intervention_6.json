We had our son young (16 and 18), and I have to be honest: there were many years where my wife admitted to me that she wishes she had an abortion rather than going through with the pregnancy. Having kids was never her life's dream, and having our son kept us back in life and kept us from accomplishing a lot of things we wanted to accomplish. Now, don't get me wrong. We love our son fully, we did everything we could to provide a warm, loving home for him. I worked my ass off to help put him through college with little debt. His mom was the picture perfect wife and mother, baking cookies with him, doing art projects, attending every single basketball game, every band concert, every play. We both did these things without ever complaining, and really cherished many of those moments.\n\nWell, my son turned out to be a great young man. He graduated with a nice science degree, met a wonderful woman who he dated for 7 years before marrying. They have been married for two years and have decided to expand their family by having a child. She's pregnant, due in May.\n\nMy wife and I have figured for a while that our \"job\" was done, and that we could finally focus on OUR lives and OUR wants and needs. These include many things like certifications and classes, travel, hobbies. All of the things we had to put on hold while we focused on raising our son. Finally, it was OUR time.\n\nWell, when my son and DIL were over a few weeks ago, shit kind of hit the fan. They were talking about different things they were looking forward to, and my son made a joke, saying, \"And of course, I'm sure we'll look forward to dropping the kids off at Grandma and Grandpa's house every now and then.\"\n\nI laughed it off for a moment, but said, \"I wouldn't count on that.\"\n\nHe got confused and asked what I meant, and I ended up having to tell him rather plainly that he shouldn't expect me and his mother to act as babysitters for his grandchildren. That we'd raised one child, and we were done and happy to focus on us, our lives, etc. My son was visibly upset by this, and said \"But you're going to be grandparents. Shouldn't you WANT to spend time with your grandkids?\"\n\nMy wife spoke up and said that yes, we would be happy to spend time with them, but that we weren't going to be babysitters, we wouldn't be raising them, we would spend them with the *family*, not *just* the grandkids -- we would not be free daycare or babysitting, we would not be taking them on trips, spoiling them, etc. She made a point to say, \"I'm sorry if this isn't what you expected. We will of course be a part of their lives, but we aren't here to be taken advantage of. Your children aren't our responsibility. We don't have a choice if you have them or not. It's your life and your choice, but please don't expect us to sacrifice ours.\"\n\nWell, it all blew up. My son said he just assumed all parents were dying for the moment when they had grandkids, that there's something wrong with us, he can't believe he'd be so cold to our (not even born yet) grandchild, etc etc. \n\nSo I have to ask. Am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for telling their son and daughter-in-law not to expect them to be babysitters for their grandkids. The story says the parents had their son young and had to sacrifice a lot, including their own goals. The son now expects them to be available for childcare, but the parents set boundaries.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. They mention that raising a child was not their wife's dream, and they had to put their lives on hold. They're now trying to reclaim that time for themselves. Setting boundaries about not being babysitters seems like a way to protect their autonomy and not be taken advantage of. It's their choice to spend time with the grandkids on their terms, but they're not obligated to provide childcare as a default.\n\nOn the other hand, the son might feel hurt because he assumed grandparents would naturally want to help. His reaction suggests he felt rejected or that his parents are being cold. But the parents clarified that they want to be part of the grandkids' lives without the responsibility of babysitting. The daughter-in-law might also have expectations, but the parents addressed that they will have time with the family, not just the kids.\n\nThe key here is whether setting these boundaries is reasonable. The parents are not refusing to spend time with the grandkids entirely; they're just not taking on the role of primary caregivers. They're making it clear that their time is their own now. The son's assumption that grandparents must be available for childcare is common but not a given. Every family has different dynamics.\n\nSo, the parents are asserting their needs and boundaries, which is healthy. They're not wrong for doing so. The son might need to adjust his expectations, but the parents aren't in the wrong for stating their limits. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
