We had our son young (16 and 18), and I have to be honest: there were many years where my wife admitted to me that she wishes she had an abortion rather than going through with the pregnancy. Having kids was never her life's dream, and having our son kept us back in life and kept us from accomplishing a lot of things we wanted to accomplish. Now, don't get me wrong. We love our son fully, we did everything we could to provide a warm, loving home for him. I worked my ass off to help put him through college with little debt. His mom was the picture perfect wife and mother, baking cookies with him, doing art projects, attending every single basketball game, every band concert, every play. We both did these things without ever complaining, and really cherished many of those moments.\n\nWell, my son turned out to be a great young man. He graduated with a nice science degree, met a wonderful woman who he dated for 7 years before marrying. They have been married for two years and have decided to expand their family by having a child. She's pregnant, due in May.\n\nMy wife and I have figured for a while that our \"job\" was done, and that we could finally focus on OUR lives and OUR wants and needs. These include many things like certifications and classes, travel, hobbies. All of the things we had to put on hold while we focused on raising our son. Finally, it was OUR time.\n\nWell, when my son and DIL were over a few weeks ago, shit kind of hit the fan. They were talking about different things they were looking forward to, and my son made a joke, saying, \"And of course, I'm sure we'll look forward to dropping the kids off at Grandma and Grandpa's house every now and then.\"\n\nI laughed it off for a moment, but said, \"I wouldn't count on that.\"\n\nHe got confused and asked what I meant, and I ended up having to tell him rather plainly that he shouldn't expect me and his mother to act as babysitters for his grandchildren. That we'd raised one child, and we were done and happy to focus on us, our lives, etc. My son was visibly upset by this, and said \"But you're going to be grandparents. Shouldn't you WANT to spend time with your grandkids?\"\n\nMy wife spoke up and said that yes, we would be happy to spend time with them, but that we weren't going to be babysitters, we wouldn't be raising them, we would spend them with the *family*, not *just* the grandkids -- we would not be free daycare or babysitting, we would not be taking them on trips, spoiling them, etc. She made a point to say, \"I'm sorry if this isn't what you expected. We will of course be a part of their lives, but we aren't here to be taken advantage of. Your children aren't our responsibility. We don't have a choice if you have them or not. It's your life and your choice, but please don't expect us to sacrifice ours.\"\n\nWell, it all blew up. My son said he just assumed all parents were dying for the moment when they had grandkids, that there's something wrong with us, he can't believe he'd be so cold to our (not even born yet) grandchild, etc etc. \n\nSo I have to ask. Am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the story is in the wrong for telling their son and daughter-in-law not to expect them to be babysitters for their grandkids. The person in the story wrote a detailed explanation about their situation. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the parents are 47 and 45, had their son when they were 16 and 18. They mention that the mother didn't want to have the child, it was a struggle, and they had to put their own lives on hold. Now, they want to focus on their own goals like certifications, travel, etc. The son expected them to be available as babysitters, but the parents made it clear they don't want to take that role. The son got upset, thinking there's something wrong with them not wanting to be involved like that.\n\nSo the question is whether their stance is wrong. Let's consider rights and expectations. The parents are setting boundaries, which is their choice. They have the right to decide how they want to spend their time. The son might have had different expectations, but that doesn't mean the parents are wrong for not meeting those expectations. The parents are not refusing to be part of their grandkids' lives entirely; they just don't want to be primary caregivers or babysitters. \n\nAlso, the parents made it clear they want to focus on their own lives. The son's reaction seems to stem from assuming his parents would want the traditional grandparent role, which might not align with their actual desires. It's important to respect each other's choices. The parents aren't being cruel; they're just setting realistic boundaries. The son might feel hurt, but the parents aren't in the wrong for prioritizing their own needs and not taking on additional responsibilities they didn't agree to.\n\nIn terms of cultural norms, some might expect grandparents to help, but others might prioritize their own lives. There's no universal right or wrong here. The key is that the parents are being honest and setting expectations, which is a responsible approach. The son's assumption that all grandparents automatically want to babysit is where the conflict arises. The parents have the right to say no without guilt. Therefore, the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
