We had our son young (16 and 18), and I have to be honest: there were many years where my wife admitted to me that she wishes she had an abortion rather than going through with the pregnancy. Having kids was never her life's dream, and having our son kept us back in life and kept us from accomplishing a lot of things we wanted to accomplish. Now, don't get me wrong. We love our son fully, we did everything we could to provide a warm, loving home for him. I worked my ass off to help put him through college with little debt. His mom was the picture perfect wife and mother, baking cookies with him, doing art projects, attending every single basketball game, every band concert, every play. We both did these things without ever complaining, and really cherished many of those moments.\n\nWell, my son turned out to be a great young man. He graduated with a nice science degree, met a wonderful woman who he dated for 7 years before marrying. They have been married for two years and have decided to expand their family by having a child. She's pregnant, due in May.\n\nMy wife and I have figured for a while that our \"job\" was done, and that we could finally focus on OUR lives and OUR wants and needs. These include many things like certifications and classes, travel, hobbies. All of the things we had to put on hold while we focused on raising our son. Finally, it was OUR time.\n\nWell, when my son and DIL were over a few weeks ago, shit kind of hit the fan. They were talking about different things they were looking forward to, and my son made a joke, saying, \"And of course, I'm sure we'll look forward to dropping the kids off at Grandma and Grandpa's house every now and then.\"\n\nI laughed it off for a moment, but said, \"I wouldn't count on that.\"\n\nHe got confused and asked what I meant, and I ended up having to tell him rather plainly that he shouldn't expect me and his mother to act as babysitters for his grandchildren. That we'd raised one child, and we were done and happy to focus on us, our lives, etc. My son was visibly upset by this, and said \"But you're going to be grandparents. Shouldn't you WANT to spend time with your grandkids?\"\n\nMy wife spoke up and said that yes, we would be happy to spend time with them, but that we weren't going to be babysitters, we wouldn't be raising them, we would spend them with the *family*, not *just* the grandkids -- we would not be free daycare or babysitting, we would not be taking them on trips, spoiling them, etc. She made a point to say, \"I'm sorry if this isn't what you expected. We will of course be a part of their lives, but we aren't here to be taken advantage of. Your children aren't our responsibility. We don't have a choice if you have them or not. It's your life and your choice, but please don't expect us to sacrifice ours.\"\n\nWell, it all blew up. My son said he just assumed all parents were dying for the moment when they had grandkids, that there's something wrong with us, he can't believe he'd be so cold to our (not even born yet) grandchild, etc etc. \n\nSo I have to ask. Am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a parent who had their son at a young age and now they're in their 40s. They've put a lot into raising their son, including financial support for his college. Now that their son is grown up and has a kid on the way, the parents are saying they don't want to be babysitters for the grandkids. They want to focus on their own lives, do things like travel and certifications. When the son makes a comment about dropping the kids off at Grandma and Grandpa's, the parents push back, explaining they won't be providing free childcare. The son is upset, thinking parents should naturally want to take care of their grandkids and that the parents are being cold.\n\nSo the question is, is the author in the wrong? Let's break it down. \n\nFirst, the parents' perspective: They had a child young, which might have impacted their own goals and dreams. They worked hard to raise their son and now feel like their time is to focus on themselves. They're not refusing to spend time with their grandkids entirely, just clarifying that they won't be acting as primary babysitters. They emphasize that they will be part of the grandkids' lives but not take on childcare responsibilities. \n\nFrom the son's perspective, he might have assumed that being a grandparent means being available for babysitting. He's hurt because he thought parents naturally want to be involved with their grandchildren in that way. He perceives the parents as being cold or uncaring, which is a big emotional reaction.\n\nThe key points here are expectations and communication. The parents are setting boundaries, which is their right. However, the son might not have realized that the parents have their own plans and limitations. The parents are being clear now, before the grandkids are born, which is probably better than waiting until there's a crisis. \n\nIn many cultures, there's an expectation that grandparents will help with childcare, but that's not universal. The parents are asserting their autonomy. They're not refusing all contact, just clarifying the terms. \n\nBut there's a nuance here. The parents are explaining that their role is to be part of the grandkids' lives, but not to provide free childcare. That's about setting boundaries, not being cold. However, the son's reaction is about feeling that this is a rejection. \n\nIs there a wrong here? The parents have a right to set their own terms. The son might have had unspoken expectations, but it's not fair to assume that all grandparents will act the same way. The parents are being upfront, which is actually considerate in the long run. \n\nHowever, the way they delivered the message might have been harsh, leading to the son's hurt feelings. But the core issue is about their right to choose how they want to engage with their grandkids. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (the author is not in the wrong) because setting boundaries around childcare is their choice. They're not denying grandparent-grandchild relationships but are defining the nature of that relationship.\n"
