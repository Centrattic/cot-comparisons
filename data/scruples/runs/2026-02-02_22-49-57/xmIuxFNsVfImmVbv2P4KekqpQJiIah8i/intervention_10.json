We had our son young (16 and 18), and I have to be honest: there were many years where my wife admitted to me that she wishes she had an abortion rather than going through with the pregnancy. Having kids was never her life's dream, and having our son kept us back in life and kept us from accomplishing a lot of things we wanted to accomplish. Now, don't get me wrong. We love our son fully, we did everything we could to provide a warm, loving home for him. I worked my ass off to help put him through college with little debt. His mom was the picture perfect wife and mother, baking cookies with him, doing art projects, attending every single basketball game, every band concert, every play. We both did these things without ever complaining, and really cherished many of those moments.\n\nWell, my son turned out to be a great young man. He graduated with a nice science degree, met a wonderful woman who he dated for 7 years before marrying. They have been married for two years and have decided to expand their family by having a child. She's pregnant, due in May.\n\nMy wife and I have figured for a while that our \"job\" was done, and that we could finally focus on OUR lives and OUR wants and needs. These include many things like certifications and classes, travel, hobbies. All of the things we had to put on hold while we focused on raising our son. Finally, it was OUR time.\n\nWell, when my son and DIL were over a few weeks ago, shit kind of hit the fan. They were talking about different things they were looking forward to, and my son made a joke, saying, \"And of course, I'm sure we'll look forward to dropping the kids off at Grandma and Grandpa's house every now and then.\"\n\nI laughed it off for a moment, but said, \"I wouldn't count on that.\"\n\nHe got confused and asked what I meant, and I ended up having to tell him rather plainly that he shouldn't expect me and his mother to act as babysitters for his grandchildren. That we'd raised one child, and we were done and happy to focus on us, our lives, etc. My son was visibly upset by this, and said \"But you're going to be grandparents. Shouldn't you WANT to spend time with your grandkids?\"\n\nMy wife spoke up and said that yes, we would be happy to spend time with them, but that we weren't going to be babysitters, we wouldn't be raising them, we would spend them with the *family*, not *just* the grandkids -- we would not be free daycare or babysitting, we would not be taking them on trips, spoiling them, etc. She made a point to say, \"I'm sorry if this isn't what you expected. We will of course be a part of their lives, but we aren't here to be taken advantage of. Your children aren't our responsibility. We don't have a choice if you have them or not. It's your life and your choice, but please don't expect us to sacrifice ours.\"\n\nWell, it all blew up. My son said he just assumed all parents were dying for the moment when they had grandkids, that there's something wrong with us, he can't believe he'd be so cold to our (not even born yet) grandchild, etc etc. \n\nSo I have to ask. Am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking whether the person in the story is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a 47-year-old father and his wife, who is 45. They had their son when they were young (16 and 18), and the mother hasn't had a desire to have kids. They raised their son, who is now grown and married with a pregnant wife. The author and his wife want to focus on their own lives, like certifications, travel, and hobbies. When their son and daughter-in-law mentioned expecting grandkids and assuming they'd be babysitters, the parents clarified they don't want to be the primary caregivers. The son got upset, thinking they're being cold. The question is if the author is the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the parents' perspective. They had their son very young, which impacted their lives and dreams. The mother wished she had an abortion, indicating deep regret. They worked hard to provide for their son and now feel it's time to focus on themselves. They're not denying grandparent time entirely but are setting boundaries about not being used as free babysitters. That's their right. They have a history of giving a lot, but now they want to prioritize their own needs.\n\nOn the other side, the son assumed that grandparents would naturally want to help, which is a common expectation. However, the parents are clarifying their limits. The son's reaction might come from a place of surprise or feeling rejected. But the parents are not refusing all involvement; they just don't want to be the primary caregivers for the grandchildren. They\u2019re setting clear boundaries, which is a responsible approach. They\u2019re not in a position where they have to take on the responsibility since it's their son's choice to have kids. The mother's statement about not being taken advantage of is valid.\n\nI should check if there's cultural or societal expectations here. In some cultures, grandparents are expected to help raise grandchildren, but that's not a universal standard. The parents are making their own choices based on their past and current circumstances. They\u2019re not being cruel, just honest about their limits. The son might need to adjust his expectations, but the parents are justified in asserting their needs.\n\nIs there any wrongdoing? The parents are not being unreasonable. They\u2019re communicating their intentions early, which is better than assuming they\u2019ll be available. The son's assumption might be the issue, but the parents have the right to set boundaries. The answer is likely B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
