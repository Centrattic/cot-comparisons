We had our son young (16 and 18), and I have to be honest: there were many years where my wife admitted to me that she wishes she had an abortion rather than going through with the pregnancy. Having kids was never her life's dream, and having our son kept us back in life and kept us from accomplishing a lot of things we wanted to accomplish. Now, don't get me wrong. We love our son fully, we did everything we could to provide a warm, loving home for him. I worked my ass off to help put him through college with little debt. His mom was the picture perfect wife and mother, baking cookies with him, doing art projects, attending every single basketball game, every band concert, every play. We both did these things without ever complaining, and really cherished many of those moments.\n\nWell, my son turned out to be a great young man. He graduated with a nice science degree, met a wonderful woman who he dated for 7 years before marrying. They have been married for two years and have decided to expand their family by having a child. She's pregnant, due in May.\n\nMy wife and I have figured for a while that our \"job\" was done, and that we could finally focus on OUR lives and OUR wants and needs. These include many things like certifications and classes, travel, hobbies. All of the things we had to put on hold while we focused on raising our son. Finally, it was OUR time.\n\nWell, when my son and DIL were over a few weeks ago, shit kind of hit the fan. They were talking about different things they were looking forward to, and my son made a joke, saying, \"And of course, I'm sure we'll look forward to dropping the kids off at Grandma and Grandpa's house every now and then.\"\n\nI laughed it off for a moment, but said, \"I wouldn't count on that.\"\n\nHe got confused and asked what I meant, and I ended up having to tell him rather plainly that he shouldn't expect me and his mother to act as babysitters for his grandchildren. That we'd raised one child, and we were done and happy to focus on us, our lives, etc. My son was visibly upset by this, and said \"But you're going to be grandparents. Shouldn't you WANT to spend time with your grandkids?\"\n\nMy wife spoke up and said that yes, we would be happy to spend time with them, but that we weren't going to be babysitters, we wouldn't be raising them, we would spend them with the *family*, not *just* the grandkids -- we would not be free daycare or babysitting, we would not be taking them on trips, spoiling them, etc. She made a point to say, \"I'm sorry if this isn't what you expected. We will of course be a part of their lives, but we aren't here to be taken advantage of. Your children aren't our responsibility. We don't have a choice if you have them or not. It's your life and your choice, but please don't expect us to sacrifice ours.\"\n\nWell, it all blew up. My son said he just assumed all parents were dying for the moment when they had grandkids, that there's something wrong with us, he can't believe he'd be so cold to our (not even born yet) grandchild, etc etc. \n\nSo I have to ask. Am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about the author and their wife setting boundaries with their son and daughter-in-law regarding grandchild babysitting. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author mentions that they had their son young, which led to missed opportunities and personal sacrifices. Now they're in their 40s and want to focus on their own goals. The son's assumption that grandparents should naturally be babysitters is challenged by the parents, leading to conflict.\n\nI should think about the rights of grandparents. In many cases, grandparents don't have legal obligations to help with childcare unless it's part of a custody arrangement. The parents here are choosing not to act as babysitters, which is their choice. They're not refusing to spend time with the grandkids entirely, just not as primary caregivers or free labor.\n\nThe son's reaction is based on his assumption that all grandparents want to help, which might be a common expectation. However, the parents have valid reasons tied to their past experiences and current life plans. They\u2019re being clear from the start, which is fair. Setting boundaries to protect their own well-being isn't unreasonable.\n\nThe wife's statement about not being responsible for the grandchildren and wanting family time, not just grandkids, makes sense. They\u2019re emphasizing their role as part of the family, not as substitute caregivers. The son's upset might stem from unmet expectations, but the parents have the right to set their own terms.\n\nI should also consider cultural norms. In some cultures, multigenerational living and childcare support is expected, but in others, it's more individualistic. The parents are asserting their preferences, which is a personal choice. The fact that the child is not even born yet adds another layer\u2014planning ahead and communicating expectations early is proactive.\n\nPossible counterarguments: Some might say grandparents should be selfless and support their children's parenting. But the parents are not refusing to be involved; they\u2019re just not committing to specific roles. They still want to be part of the grandkids' lives, just on their terms.\n\nAnother angle: The son's surprise might be because he hasn't considered his parents' perspective. The parents, having already raised one child, might feel that the new parents should take primary responsibility. It's a reasonable stance given their history of sacrifice for the son.\n\nIn conclusion, the authors are not in the wrong. They\u2019re making decisions based on their experiences and current life goals, and it's their right to set these boundaries. The answer is B.\n"
