We had our son young (16 and 18), and I have to be honest: there were many years where my wife admitted to me that she wishes she had an abortion rather than going through with the pregnancy. Having kids was never her life's dream, and having our son kept us back in life and kept us from accomplishing a lot of things we wanted to accomplish. Now, don't get me wrong. We love our son fully, we did everything we could to provide a warm, loving home for him. I worked my ass off to help put him through college with little debt. His mom was the picture perfect wife and mother, baking cookies with him, doing art projects, attending every single basketball game, every band concert, every play. We both did these things without ever complaining, and really cherished many of those moments.\n\nWell, my son turned out to be a great young man. He graduated with a nice science degree, met a wonderful woman who he dated for 7 years before marrying. They have been married for two years and have decided to expand their family by having a child. She's pregnant, due in May.\n\nMy wife and I have figured for a while that our \"job\" was done, and that we could finally focus on OUR lives and OUR wants and needs. These include many things like certifications and classes, travel, hobbies. All of the things we had to put on hold while we focused on raising our son. Finally, it was OUR time.\n\nWell, when my son and DIL were over a few weeks ago, shit kind of hit the fan. They were talking about different things they were looking forward to, and my son made a joke, saying, \"And of course, I'm sure we'll look forward to dropping the kids off at Grandma and Grandpa's house every now and then.\"\n\nI laughed it off for a moment, but said, \"I wouldn't count on that.\"\n\nHe got confused and asked what I meant, and I ended up having to tell him rather plainly that he shouldn't expect me and his mother to act as babysitters for his grandchildren. That we'd raised one child, and we were done and happy to focus on us, our lives, etc. My son was visibly upset by this, and said \"But you're going to be grandparents. Shouldn't you WANT to spend time with your grandkids?\"\n\nMy wife spoke up and said that yes, we would be happy to spend time with them, but that we weren't going to be babysitters, we wouldn't be raising them, we would spend them with the *family*, not *just* the grandkids -- we would not be free daycare or babysitting, we would not be taking them on trips, spoiling them, etc. She made a point to say, \"I'm sorry if this isn't what you expected. We will of course be a part of their lives, but we aren't here to be taken advantage of. Your children aren't our responsibility. We don't have a choice if you have them or not. It's your life and your choice, but please don't expect us to sacrifice ours.\"\n\nWell, it all blew up. My son said he just assumed all parents were dying for the moment when they had grandkids, that there's something wrong with us, he can't believe he'd be so cold to our (not even born yet) grandchild, etc etc. \n\nSo I have to ask. Am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author (the person who wrote the story) is in the wrong for telling their son and daughter-in-law not to expect them to be babysitters for their grandchildren.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and their wife had a son when they were young (16 and 18). They had to give up a lot of their own plans and dreams for their son. Now, their son is married and expecting a child. The author and his wife feel that their job is done and they want to focus on their own lives, which includes travel, hobbies, education, etc. They made it clear to their son that they won't be acting as babysitters for the grandkids, just that they'll be part of the grandkids' lives. The son and daughter-in-law reacted negatively, feeling surprised and upset, thinking grandparents should naturally want to help. The author is now questioning if they were wrong.\n\nSo, the key points here are the parents' rights to set boundaries versus the expectations of the children. The author's parents had a tough time raising their son due to their young age and the fact that they didn't plan to have him. The mother even mentioned wishing she had an abortion. Now, they want to reclaim their lives. The son, on the other hand, assumed traditional grandparent roles, expecting help with childcare.\n\nI think it's important to consider that grandparents have the right to decide how involved they want to be in their grandchildren's lives. There's no universal expectation that they must provide babysitting services. The author's parents are communicating their boundaries clearly, which is reasonable. However, they did it in a way that might have been abrupt, leading to conflict. \n\nThe son might be reacting from a place of surprise because he didn't realize there might be different expectations. But the author's stance is about prioritizing their own needs after raising their child. It's a balance between personal autonomy and family expectations. \n\nIn many cultures, grandparents do help with childcare, but it's not a given. The author's parents are setting clear limits, which is their right. They're not refusing to be part of the grandkids' lives entirely, just not as primary caregivers. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author isn't in the wrong for setting these boundaries. The problem might be more about communication and the son's expectations not aligning with reality. The parents have the right to prioritize their lives post-retirement (even if they're not retired yet) and not be used as free childcare. Therefore, the answer should be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
