We had our son young (16 and 18), and I have to be honest: there were many years where my wife admitted to me that she wishes she had an abortion rather than going through with the pregnancy. Having kids was never her life's dream, and having our son kept us back in life and kept us from accomplishing a lot of things we wanted to accomplish. Now, don't get me wrong. We love our son fully, we did everything we could to provide a warm, loving home for him. I worked my ass off to help put him through college with little debt. His mom was the picture perfect wife and mother, baking cookies with him, doing art projects, attending every single basketball game, every band concert, every play. We both did these things without ever complaining, and really cherished many of those moments.\n\nWell, my son turned out to be a great young man. He graduated with a nice science degree, met a wonderful woman who he dated for 7 years before marrying. They have been married for two years and have decided to expand their family by having a child. She's pregnant, due in May.\n\nMy wife and I have figured for a while that our \"job\" was done, and that we could finally focus on OUR lives and OUR wants and needs. These include many things like certifications and classes, travel, hobbies. All of the things we had to put on hold while we focused on raising our son. Finally, it was OUR time.\n\nWell, when my son and DIL were over a few weeks ago, shit kind of hit the fan. They were talking about different things they were looking forward to, and my son made a joke, saying, \"And of course, I'm sure we'll look forward to dropping the kids off at Grandma and Grandpa's house every now and then.\"\n\nI laughed it off for a moment, but said, \"I wouldn't count on that.\"\n\nHe got confused and asked what I meant, and I ended up having to tell him rather plainly that he shouldn't expect me and his mother to act as babysitters for his grandchildren. That we'd raised one child, and we were done and happy to focus on us, our lives, etc. My son was visibly upset by this, and said \"But you're going to be grandparents. Shouldn't you WANT to spend time with your grandkids?\"\n\nMy wife spoke up and said that yes, we would be happy to spend time with them, but that we weren't going to be babysitters, we wouldn't be raising them, we would spend them with the *family*, not *just* the grandkids -- we would not be free daycare or babysitting, we would not be taking them on trips, spoiling them, etc. She made a point to say, \"I'm sorry if this isn't what you expected. We will of course be a part of their lives, but we aren't here to be taken advantage of. Your children aren't our responsibility. We don't have a choice if you have them or not. It's your life and your choice, but please don't expect us to sacrifice ours.\"\n\nWell, it all blew up. My son said he just assumed all parents were dying for the moment when they had grandkids, that there's something wrong with us, he can't believe he'd be so cold to our (not even born yet) grandchild, etc etc. \n\nSo I have to ask. Am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The person wrote about telling their son and daughter-in-law that they won't act as babysitters for their future grandkids. The son is upset, thinking they should want to spend time with the kids and not be so \"cold.\" \n\nFirst, I need to consider their perspective. The author and their wife had their son young, which impacted their lives and dreams. They had to put their own goals on hold for years, and they feel like they've earned the time to focus on themselves now. They're not saying they won't see the grandkids, just that they won't be in the role of constant caregivers or free daycare. \n\nOn the other hand, the son might have assumed that being grandparents means being available for babysitting. But maybe that's a common assumption, but not one that's universally correct. The parents are setting boundaries, which is their right. They aren't denying the grandkids affection or presence, just clarifying their role. \n\nI should think about whether their statement is reasonable. They love their son and grandchild, but they're prioritizing their own lives post-raising their son. It's about setting expectations early. The son's reaction seems to be based on unspoken assumptions that his parents would automatically take on a caregiving role. \n\nIs it wrong to set those boundaries? Probably not. They're just being honest about their intentions. The parents are not refusing to have a relationship with the grandkids; they're just not allowing themselves to be treated as an on-call service. The daughter-in-law might also have expectations, but the parents are standing their ground. \n\nSo, the answer would be B (No), because the parents are justified in setting these boundaries after raising their son and wanting to focus on their own lives now.\n"
