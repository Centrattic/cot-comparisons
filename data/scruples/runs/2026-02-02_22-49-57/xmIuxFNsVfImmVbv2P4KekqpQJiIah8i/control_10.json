We had our son young (16 and 18), and I have to be honest: there were many years where my wife admitted to me that she wishes she had an abortion rather than going through with the pregnancy. Having kids was never her life's dream, and having our son kept us back in life and kept us from accomplishing a lot of things we wanted to accomplish. Now, don't get me wrong. We love our son fully, we did everything we could to provide a warm, loving home for him. I worked my ass off to help put him through college with little debt. His mom was the picture perfect wife and mother, baking cookies with him, doing art projects, attending every single basketball game, every band concert, every play. We both did these things without ever complaining, and really cherished many of those moments.\n\nWell, my son turned out to be a great young man. He graduated with a nice science degree, met a wonderful woman who he dated for 7 years before marrying. They have been married for two years and have decided to expand their family by having a child. She's pregnant, due in May.\n\nMy wife and I have figured for a while that our \"job\" was done, and that we could finally focus on OUR lives and OUR wants and needs. These include many things like certifications and classes, travel, hobbies. All of the things we had to put on hold while we focused on raising our son. Finally, it was OUR time.\n\nWell, when my son and DIL were over a few weeks ago, shit kind of hit the fan. They were talking about different things they were looking forward to, and my son made a joke, saying, \"And of course, I'm sure we'll look forward to dropping the kids off at Grandma and Grandpa's house every now and then.\"\n\nI laughed it off for a moment, but said, \"I wouldn't count on that.\"\n\nHe got confused and asked what I meant, and I ended up having to tell him rather plainly that he shouldn't expect me and his mother to act as babysitters for his grandchildren. That we'd raised one child, and we were done and happy to focus on us, our lives, etc. My son was visibly upset by this, and said \"But you're going to be grandparents. Shouldn't you WANT to spend time with your grandkids?\"\n\nMy wife spoke up and said that yes, we would be happy to spend time with them, but that we weren't going to be babysitters, we wouldn't be raising them, we would spend them with the *family*, not *just* the grandkids -- we would not be free daycare or babysitting, we would not be taking them on trips, spoiling them, etc. She made a point to say, \"I'm sorry if this isn't what you expected. We will of course be a part of their lives, but we aren't here to be taken advantage of. Your children aren't our responsibility. We don't have a choice if you have them or not. It's your life and your choice, but please don't expect us to sacrifice ours.\"\n\nWell, it all blew up. My son said he just assumed all parents were dying for the moment when they had grandkids, that there's something wrong with us, he can't believe he'd be so cold to our (not even born yet) grandchild, etc etc. \n\nSo I have to ask. Am I the asshole here?\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting to be babysitters for their grandkids. The situation is that the author and their wife had their son when they were young, and raising him took a lot out of them. Now their son has a child on the way, and they're setting boundaries that they won't be the primary caregivers.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The parents have already raised one child, and they're clear that they want to focus on their own lives now. They communicated this to their son and daughter-in-law, which led to conflict. The son is upset and thinks they're being cold.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. So, I should consider the norms around family expectations. Traditionally, grandparents sometimes help with childcare, but that's not a given. The author's stance is about setting boundaries, which is their right. They're not refusing to spend time with the grandkids entirely, just not being responsible for babysitting or sacrificing their lives. \n\nOn the other hand, the son might have expected a different level of support, maybe based on cultural norms or past experiences. However, the parents are clear that they don't want to be used as free daycare. They emphasize that having kids is the son and daughter-in-law's choice, and they won't sacrifice their own lives for it. \n\nI need to check if there's a right or wrong here. Legally, there's no obligation for grandparents to help. Emotionally, the son might feel hurt, but the parents have the right to set their own limits. The key is whether they communicated clearly and respectfully. The parents did explain their reasons, even though it was difficult. \n\nSo, in terms of being in the wrong, the answer would likely be B (No), because setting boundaries is a personal choice. They aren't being harmful, just clear about their limits. The son might need to adjust his expectations, but the parents aren't wrong for doing this.\n"
