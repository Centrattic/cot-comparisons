I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author attending church with their parents despite being an atheist. They mention wearing earbuds and texting during mass. The parents are forcing them to attend, and the author feels they have to rebel by listening to music and texting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and familial expectations. In many religious contexts, attending church is seen as a communal and respectful activity. Disrupting this with earbuds and texting might be considered disrespectful, especially in a setting where quiet reflection and participation are expected. However, the author is being forced to attend against their beliefs. That's a key point. Freedom of religion includes the right not to practice a religion.\n\nThe parents might see the author's actions as disrespectful, but the author is in a bind. They're being compelled to participate in a religious activity they don't believe in, which could be seen as a violation of their personal beliefs. The use of earbuds and texting might be their way of coping with the situation. \n\nBut from a social standpoint, even if the author is being forced, their actions during the service could be seen as impolite. Maybe they should find a more discreet way to cope, like sitting in a less prominent place or finding an alternative. However, the parents are the ones forcing the attendance, so they might bear some responsibility here. \n\nThe question is about whether the author is in the wrong. If we consider the parents' role in forcing attendance, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. But in terms of behavior during the mass, they might be seen as disrespectful. However, since they're being forced to attend against their will, their actions could be a form of protest. \n\nSo, is it AITA? The answer could be B (not in the wrong) because they're being forced to attend and their actions are a way to cope with an uncomfortable situation. However, some might argue they should find a more respectful way to handle it. I think the key here is the coercion by the parents. The author's actions are a response to that, so they might not be entirely at fault. Therefore, the answer is B.\n"
