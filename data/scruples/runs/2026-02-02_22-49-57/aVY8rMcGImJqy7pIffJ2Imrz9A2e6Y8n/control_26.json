I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person is in the wrong for wearing earbuds and texting during church. The person is an atheist forced to attend mass by their parents.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parents are taking their child to church every Sunday, even though the child is an atheist and has expressed their disbelief. The parents are forcing them to attend, which is a key point. The child is using earbuds and texting to cope with the situation.\n\nNow, from a religious standpoint, church is a place of worship where one is expected to be attentive and respectful. If someone is attending as a requirement rather than by choice, they might feel uncomfortable. However, intentionally using earbuds and texting could be seen as disrespectful to the parents and the religious setting. But the parents are forcing the child to attend, which complicates things. The child isn't there voluntarily, so their actions might be a form of protest.\n\nAnother angle is the parents' behavior. They are forcing their child to attend church and then criticizing them for not being engaged. The child has explained their lack of belief multiple times, but the parents dismiss this. The parents' response (dirty looks and criticizing the child's attitude) seems unfair because they are the ones enforcing the attendance. The child's actions might be a way to deal with being forced into a situation they disagree with.\n\nLegally or morally, there's no law against wearing earbuds in church, but social norms might dictate otherwise. However, the parents are creating the situation by forcing attendance. The child's actions could be seen as a form of passive resistance rather than being disrespectful. The parents' expectation that the child should enjoy attending church despite their beliefs is unrealistic.\n\nIn summary, while the child's actions might be seen as disrespectful in a traditional church setting, the parents are at fault for forcing attendance despite the child's clear lack of belief. Therefore, the child is not in the wrong.\n"
