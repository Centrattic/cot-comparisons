I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the person is an atheist but their parents have started going to church and are forcing them to attend every Sunday. The author is bringing earbuds to listen to music and texting friends during mass. The mom is upset, giving dirty looks, and later criticizes the author's attitude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is being forced to attend a religious service they don't believe in. They've told their parents they're atheists, but the parents ignore that and still make them come. The author's response is to listen to music and text friends. \n\nFrom the author's perspective, they might feel that their autonomy is being violated. They have the right to their own beliefs and might be trying to cope with an uncomfortable situation. Using earbuds and texting could be a way to pass the time since they don't agree with the service. However, in a religious setting, especially one that the family is attending together, there might be social expectations to participate respectfully, even if one doesn't share the beliefs. \n\nThe parents might see the author's actions as disrespectful or rebellious. They could argue that being present during the service, even if not participating, is a sign of respect towards the family's religious practices. The mom's comment about having a negative attitude suggests she feels disrespected.\n\nLegally, the author isn't in the wrong, but socially or within family dynamics, it's more complex. The parents are forcing attendance, which could be seen as infringing on the child's freedom of religion. The author's actions are a form of passive resistance. However, in many cultures, showing up and being present, even if not participating, is considered polite. Using earbuds might be seen as a way to avoid the situation entirely, which could be viewed as disrespectful.\n\nBut since the author is an adult (assuming they are, given they're making their own choices), they have the right to their own beliefs. The parents forcing them to attend could be the real issue here. The author's actions are a way to cope with an uncomfortable situation they're being forced into. However, in a shared family activity, there's an expectation of mutual respect. The author's actions might be seen as undermining that respect, even if they don't share the beliefs.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. On one hand, they're being forced into a setting they disagree with. On the other, their actions might be seen as disrespectful. But considering that they've communicated their atheism and the parents are ignoring their beliefs, the author's actions could be justified as a form of self-respect. However, in the context of family and social norms, they might be seen as inconsiderate. \n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. If we look strictly at respect for the family's wishes versus personal rights, it's a balance. But since the parents are forcing attendance, the author's resistance could be justified. The answer might lean towards B (not in the wrong), but there's room for argument either way.\n"
