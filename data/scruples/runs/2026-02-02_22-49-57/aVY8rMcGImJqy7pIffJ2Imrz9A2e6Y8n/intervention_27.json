I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the person who posted the situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a teenager who's an atheist being forced by their parents to attend church. The author is using earbuds and texting during mass, which angers their mom. The parents insist on attending church now, despite the child's beliefs.\n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The author is forced to attend a religious service they don't believe in. They've communicated their disbelief multiple times. The parents are dismissing their views and making them go. The author is using earbuds and texting as a way to cope or pass the time since they're not engaged. The mom is upset about the attitude, but the author feels this is a natural reaction to being forced into something they don't want to do.\n\nSo, is the author at fault? Well, the parents are enforcing their religious attendance, which might be a family tradition or their new choice. However, the child is being respectful in their own way by not causing a scene but instead disengaging. Using earbuds and texting could be seen as disrespectful in the church context, but given the circumstances\u2014being forced to attend something they don't believe in\u2014it's more about the conflict between parental authority and the child's autonomy.\n\nThe parents might see the behavior as disrespectful, but the root issue is the child's lack of genuine participation in a belief system they reject. The author isn't disrupting the service; they're just not engaging. So, the problem might be more on the parents' side for not respecting the child's beliefs and autonomy. The author's actions are a reaction to being forced into an environment they find meaningless. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong; the parents are imposing their beliefs without considering the child's stance. Answer B.\n"
