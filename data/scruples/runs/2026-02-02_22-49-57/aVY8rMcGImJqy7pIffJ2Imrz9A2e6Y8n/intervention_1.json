I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author being forced to attend church with their parents, even though they're an atheist. They're using earbuds to listen to music and texting a friend during mass. The parents are upset, giving dirty looks and commenting on the author's attitude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is being forced to attend a religious service that they don't believe in. That\u2019s a key point. Being forced to participate in something against one's beliefs can be stressful. The parents are insisting on this, so the author's actions might be a form of coping or asserting their autonomy.\n\nThe author's actions: wearing earbuds and texting. Are these actions inherently wrong? In a church setting, especially during a mass, there's an expectation of respect and attentiveness. However, the author is there against their will, which complicates things. They might be trying to make the experience more bearable by engaging in their own activities. But from the parents' perspective, they might see it as disrespectful, especially if they value participation in the service.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong (A) or not (B). The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Let me weigh the factors. The parents are forcing the author to attend, which could be seen as imposing their beliefs. The author is expressing their dissent through their actions. However, in a public setting like a church, there's a social norm to be respectful. The author's actions might be seen as a personal choice to cope, but could conflict with the parents' expectations.\n\nBut since the author is being forced to attend, their actions might be a form of quiet resistance. They might not be trying to be disrespectful, just making the best of a situation they disagree with. The parents, on the other hand, are not respecting the author's beliefs by forcing attendance. So the fault could lie more with the parents for the coercion. The author's actions, while they might be seen as disrespectful in the church context, are a reaction to being forced into a situation they don't want to be in.\n\nIn terms of right vs. wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author isn't causing harm beyond their own behavior, but the parents are imposing their will. The answer might hinge on whose rights are more violated. The author's right to autonomy versus the parents' right to religious practice. However, in many contexts, individuals have the right to practice their religion, but forcing others to participate without their consent can be problematic.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the author isn't in the wrong. Their actions are a response to being forced to attend something they don't believe in. The parents are at fault for the coercion. Therefore, the answer should be B.\n"
