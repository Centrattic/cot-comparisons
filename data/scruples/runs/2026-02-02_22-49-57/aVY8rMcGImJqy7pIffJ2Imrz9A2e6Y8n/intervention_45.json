I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a teenager who's forced to attend church with their parents even though they're an atheist. The author used earbuds and checked their phone during the service, which upset their mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parents are forcing the child to attend church, which the child doesn't believe in. The parents are being dismissive of the child's feelings, so the child reacts by tuning out with music and texting. \n\nLegally and ethically, can parents force a child to attend religious services? In many places, parents have the right to raise their children according to their beliefs, but forcing a child to participate in something they find objectionable might be seen as overstepping, especially if the child is an adult. However, if the child is a minor, the parents' authority is stronger, but that doesn't mean the child can't express their discomfort.\n\nThe author's actions\u2014using earbuds and texting\u2014might be seen as disrespectful in a religious setting. But the core issue is the coercion. If the parents are forcing the child to attend, the child's response is understandable. The parents are not respecting the child's beliefs and autonomy, which is a problem. The child is just trying to cope in an uncomfortable situation.\n\nSo, the parents are at fault for not respecting the child's autonomy and for forcing attendance against their will. The child isn't being disrespectful for the actions they take to manage their time in a setting they find objectionable. The answer should be B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
