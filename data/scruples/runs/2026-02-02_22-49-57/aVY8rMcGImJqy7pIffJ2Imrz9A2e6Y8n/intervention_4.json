I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about attending a church mass against their will, being an atheist, and using earbuds and texting during the service.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is forced to attend church by their parents despite being an atheist. They've tried to express their beliefs and discomfort, but the parents dismiss their concerns. The author brings earbuds and texts a friend during the mass. The mother gives dirty looks and criticizes the author's attitude.\n\nThe main question is about whether the author is in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, if someone is being forced to participate in an activity they don't believe in, and they're trying to cope by using earbuds and texting, is that their fault? Well, the parents are the ones forcing them to attend, which raises issues about freedom of belief and autonomy. The author's actions might be seen as a form of resistance or coping mechanism against being compelled to participate in something against their beliefs.\n\nHowever, in the context of the church setting, using earbuds and texting could be considered disrespectful to some. The parents might view the author's behavior as showing a lack of respect for the service, regardless of the author's personal beliefs. But the core issue here is more about the parents' imposition on the child's autonomy and the child's response to that imposition.\n\nThe author has clearly communicated their beliefs and dislike for attending, yet the parents continue to force them. In such a scenario, the author's actions could be seen as a reasonable way to handle the stress or discomfort of being in an environment they find objectionable. The parents, on the other hand, are not respecting the child's autonomy and beliefs, which is a more significant issue.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author isn't in the wrong. The parents are the ones at fault for not respecting their child's beliefs and autonomy. The answer should be B (No).\n"
