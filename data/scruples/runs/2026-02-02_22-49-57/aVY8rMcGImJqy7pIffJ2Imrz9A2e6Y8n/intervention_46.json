I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for using earbuds and texting during church when forced to attend by their parents, despite being an atheist.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural context. In many religious settings, especially Christian churches, there's an expectation of respectful behavior during services. This includes not using phones or listening to music, as it's seen as disrespectful to the service and to others. The author's actions might be viewed as dismissive or irreverent by the churchgoers and their family.\n\nFrom the parents' perspective, they might feel that attending church is important for family unity or religious practice. They're forcing their child to attend, which can be problematic because forcing someone to participate in religious activities can infringe on their autonomy. However, the parents might not realize that their child's actions during the service could be seen as disrespectful, even if the child is compelled to attend.\n\nThe author is an atheist, so they don't share the religious beliefs of their family. Using earbuds and texting is a way to cope with being in an environment where they don't believe. However, the way they're doing this\u2014during a service\u2014could be seen as a lack of consideration for the setting. Others in the church might find this behavior disruptive or offensive, even if the author isn't there by choice.\n\nThe key points are respect for the setting and the parents' intentions. The author's actions might be a form of resistance or coping, but they could also be perceived as disrespectful. The parents, while forcing attendance, might not have considered the child's need for autonomy or alternative ways to handle the situation. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit nuanced. The parents are wrong for forcing the child to attend against their beliefs, but the child might also be wrong for not respecting the environment they're in. However, since the child is in a situation they're not comfortable with, their actions could be seen as a way to maintain personal peace, which might be understandable. Still, there's a societal expectation in such spaces to refrain from using phones and to be present. So, the author might be in the wrong for not adhering to those norms, even if they don't believe in the religion.\n"
