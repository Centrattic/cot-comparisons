I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the provided scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is an atheist being forced to attend church by their parents, and during the mass, they wear earbuds and check their phone. The parents are upset, saying the author has a negative attitude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is being forced to attend a religious service they don't believe in. That's a key point. Being forced to participate in something you're not comfortable with can lead to resentment. The author's actions of using earbuds and texting might be seen as disrespectful in the church setting, but they have a reason: they don't agree with the beliefs and are attending against their will.\n\nNow, the parents' perspective: they might value family unity and religious tradition, and they could view the author's behavior as showing disdain for their beliefs and the shared activity. However, the author has communicated their lack of belief multiple times, so the parents are aware. The question is whether the author is wrong for expressing their discomfort in this way.\n\nI should think about respect and personal space. Even if the author is in a religious setting, they have the right to manage their own experience. If they're not participating, using earbuds to block out the service and texting could be their way of coping. But the parents might see it as disrespectful. However, being forced to attend might make the parents at fault for not respecting the author's beliefs. \n\nAlso, the idea of being forced to attend. If someone is compelled to go to a place where they don't believe, their actions there might be a reflection of their true feelings. The author isn't actively disrupting the service, just listening to music and texting. That's probably passive and not interfering with others. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that in a family setting, showing more respect by not using earbuds and putting away the phone is necessary. But the parents are the ones forcing the author to be there, so the responsibility is on them to respect the author's autonomy. \n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether the parents are in the wrong for forcing attendance and if the author's actions are a reasonable response. Given that the author has clearly stated their beliefs and is still made to attend, their actions might be a form of pushing back. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong here. The parents aren't respecting the author's autonomy, and the author isn't obligated to participate in a way that makes them uncomfortable.\n"
