I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wearing earbuds and checking their phone during a church mass they're forced to attend. The parent's perspective is important here. They want their child to attend church, but the child is an atheist. The parents brush off the child's beliefs and force them to go. The child brings earbuds and texts a friend. The mom is upset, calling them negative.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parents are forcing attendance despite the child's lack of belief. The child is in a situation they don't agree with. Using earbuds and texting might be seen as disrespectful in the parents' eyes, especially in a religious setting where attention is expected. But the child is also in a situation they find uncomfortable and is trying to cope. \n\nIs the child being disrespectful, or is it a matter of the parents not respecting the child's beliefs? The parents are forcing attendance, which might be infringing on the child's autonomy. The child's actions could be a form of resistance against being forced to participate in something they don't believe in. However, in a public setting like a church, there's an expectation of respect regardless of personal beliefs. Distractions like earbuds and phones might disrupt the experience for others or show disrespect to the religious practices. \n\nBut the key point is that the parents are forcing attendance. If the child is being made to attend against their will, their actions might be a way to assert some control. However, in terms of social norms, even in a setting one disagrees with, there's often an expectation to be present and not visibly disengaged. The child's actions could be seen as disrespectful to the family and the religious context, even if they don't share the beliefs.\n\nOn the other hand, the parents are not respecting the child's autonomy by forcing attendance. The conflict arises from both sides: parents enforcing their values and the child resisting. The question is whether the child's actions cross the line into being disrespectful regardless of the situation. It's a balance between respecting personal autonomy and respecting others' values in a shared space.\n\nIn conclusion, while the parents are at fault for forcing attendance, the child's actions might be seen as disrespectful in the context of the church service, even if they're coping with an unwanted obligation. So the answer could be that the child is in the wrong (A), but there's a strong argument for the parents not respecting the child's views (B). However, the question is specifically about the child's actions. Given that the parents are forcing them to attend, the child's actions are a form of asserting independence, which might be justifiable. So maybe the answer is B.\n"
