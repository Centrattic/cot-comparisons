I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author attending a church mass with their parents despite being an atheist. They wear earbuds and check their phone during the service, which leads to their mom giving them dirty looks and criticizing their attitude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is forced to attend church by their parents, even though they don't believe in the religion. They've communicated their lack of belief multiple times, but the parents ignore that and still make them go. The author's actions during the service\u2014listening to music and texting\u2014are seen as disrespectful by the parents.\n\nFrom a religious standpoint, churches often expect attendees to be attentive and respectful during services. Using earbuds and texting could be seen as disruptive or showing disrespect towards the worship environment. However, the author's perspective is that they have no personal interest in the service and are being forced to attend against their beliefs. This raises questions about autonomy and respect for personal beliefs.\n\nThe parents are enforcing their religious practices on their child, which might conflict with the child's right to freedom of religion or lack thereof. The author's actions could be a form of protest or coping mechanism against being forced into an unwanted activity. On the other hand, the parents might feel that their child's behavior is disrespectful and undermines their religious practices.\n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. Legally and ethically, individuals have the right to their beliefs, but social norms in religious settings often require a certain level of respect. The key issue here is the forced participation. If the parents are using coercion, the author's actions might be a justified response to that pressure. However, if the author is in a public religious setting, there might be an expectation of respectful behavior regardless of personal beliefs.\n\nThe author's use of earbuds and texting could be seen as a way to disengage from the service, which is understandable given their lack of interest. But from the parents' perspective, it's disrespectful. The answer likely depends on balancing the right to personal belief with social expectations in shared spaces. Since the parents are forcing the author to attend, the author might not be in the wrong for seeking ways to cope, even if it's not the most respectful behavior. However, there's a counterargument that any setting, religious or not, expects some level of decorum. So, it's a complex situation where both sides have valid points, but the forced nature of participation might shift responsibility more towards the parents for the conflict.\n"
