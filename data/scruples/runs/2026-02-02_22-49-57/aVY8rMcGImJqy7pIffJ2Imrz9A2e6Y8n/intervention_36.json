I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person is in the wrong for using earbuds and texting during a church service they're forced to attend. The person is an atheist and has communicated their lack of belief, but the parents insist on bringing them. They're using earbuds and texting as a way to deal with being there against their will.\n\nFirst, the parents are forcing their child to attend a church they don't believe in. That seems problematic. The child has tried to express their non-belief, but the parents dismiss it. The act of wearing earbuds and texting might be seen as disrespectful in a religious setting, but the context is important here. The child is there because they're forced, not by choice. They're trying to cope with an uncomfortable situation.\n\nFrom the parents' perspective, they might view the child's actions as disrespectful to the church and their family's beliefs. But from the child's side, they're being coerced into participating in something they disagree with. The parents are not respecting the child's autonomy and expressed beliefs.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, being in a place of worship and using earbuds or phones is often seen as impolite. However, if the individual isn't part of that belief system and is there under duress, the expectation of respect might be more on the parents to understand the child's position. The child is not actively causing harm beyond their own behavior, though that behavior could be seen as disrespectful.\n\nThe parents are at fault for forcing attendance and not respecting the child's autonomy and beliefs. The child's actions are a reaction to that coercion. So, the author is not in the wrong because the parents are the ones forcing them into a situation they're uncomfortable with. The child's actions are a form of coping, not intentional disrespect beyond their own choice to attend.\n"
