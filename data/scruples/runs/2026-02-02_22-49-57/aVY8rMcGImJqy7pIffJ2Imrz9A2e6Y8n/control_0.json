I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about attending church against their will, being an atheist, and using earbuds and texting during mass. The parents are forcing them to go, and the person is rebelling by listening to music and texting. The parents are upset, calling them negative.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person is forced to attend church, which they don't believe in. That's a key point. Being forced to participate in religious activities when you don't believe can be stressful. The person is an atheist, so the church environment might be uncomfortable for them. \n\nThen, the actions they took: using earbuds and texting. From a societal or religious standpoint, during a church service, people are expected to be attentive and respectful. Wearing earbuds and texting could be seen as disrespectful. But the context is that they were forced there and don't believe, which complicates things. Are they at fault for trying to cope in a situation they're uncomfortable in?\n\nOn one hand, the parents are forcing their child to attend church, which might infringe on the child's personal beliefs and autonomy. On the other hand, the child's actions during the service could be seen as disrespectful in the setting, regardless of their personal beliefs. \n\nReligious practices often have social norms, and disrupting them might be frowned upon. But if the environment is oppressive or the child is being forced to attend, their reaction might be understandable. It's a balance between respecting personal beliefs and the social norms of the setting. \n\nThe parents' response\u2014calling the child negative\u2014doesn't address the root issue of forcing them to attend. The child might feel they have no choice but to act disengaged. Is the child wrong for disengaging in a mandatory setting they disagree with? It's a conflict between personal autonomy and social expectations.\n\nI think the parents are at fault for forcing the child to attend, but the child's actions could also be seen as disrespectful in the context of the church. However, considering the child's lack of belief and being forced there, their actions might be a form of resistance. But from the church's perspective, it's still disrespectful. So it's a bit of a gray area. The answer might depend on whether the focus is on the parents' coercion or the child's actions in the specific setting.\n"
