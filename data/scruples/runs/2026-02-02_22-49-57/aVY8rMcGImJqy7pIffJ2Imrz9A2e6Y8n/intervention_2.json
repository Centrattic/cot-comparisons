I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for using earbuds and texting during a church mass they're forced to attend. They mention being an atheist and their parents forcing them to go despite their disbelief. The author is wondering if their actions make them a \"bitch\" or if their parents are at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person is being forced to attend a religious service they don't believe in. That's a key point. If someone is compelled to participate in activities against their will, their actions during that time might be seen as a form of resistance or coping. Using earbuds to listen to music and texting could be their way of dealing with the discomfort or boredom from being forced to attend.\n\nThen there's the aspect of respect. The parents might view the behavior as disrespectful, especially in a religious setting. However, if the individual doesn't hold the same beliefs, the expectation of respect might be different. The question is whether the child is obligated to participate in a way that aligns with the parents' religious practices when they don't share those beliefs.\n\nAnother angle is the parents' role. They're forcing the child to attend, which can be seen as infringing on their autonomy. If the parents are the ones initiating the situation without considering the child's beliefs, the responsibility might lie more with them. The child's actions could be a reaction to that pressure.\n\nAlso, cultural and family norms play a part here. In some cultures, attending religious services is expected regardless of personal belief. But the scenario states that the parents recently became interested in church, suggesting it's a new imposition. The child's previous communication about their atheism might indicate that they've tried to express their discomfort, and the parents are dismissing it, leading to the child's actions.\n\nThe author's actions\u2014listening to music and texting\u2014are relatively passive. They're not disrupting the service in a major way, just occupying themselves. However, in a religious context, even passive disengagement might be perceived as disrespectful. But if the person is there against their will, the fault could be on the parents for not respecting the child's autonomy.\n\nConsidering all these factors, the parents are forcing their child to participate in an activity the child finds objectionable. The child's response is a way to cope with that situation. The parents' criticism of the child's attitude might be misplaced, as the root issue is the forced participation. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong; the parents are at fault for not respecting their child's beliefs and autonomy.\n"
