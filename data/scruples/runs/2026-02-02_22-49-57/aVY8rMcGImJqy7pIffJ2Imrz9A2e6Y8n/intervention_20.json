I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about attending church against their will as an atheist, using earbuds and texting during mass, and facing criticism from their mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is an atheist but forced to attend church by their parents. They're using earbuds and texting to cope. The parents are upset, saying the author has a negative attitude.\n\nI should think about the ethics here. The author isn't breaking any laws, but maybe there's a social or religious expectation they're violating. However, they're being forced to attend a place where their beliefs don't align. Using earbuds could be seen as disrespectful in a religious setting, but if they're there against their will, that's different.\n\nAlso, the parents might believe they're teaching the child about their faith or family traditions. But the child is clear about their atheism and the parents aren't respecting that. The child's actions are a form of coping with an unwanted situation. There's a conflict between parental wishes and the child's autonomy.\n\nLegally, there's no issue. Socially, it depends on cultural norms. In some contexts, earbuds in church might be frowned upon. But if the parents are forcing attendance, the child's actions could be a way to maintain their mental well-being. The parents' response seems harsh given the circumstances.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the parents are forcing attendance, the child's actions are a reaction to that pressure. The parents have a responsibility to respect the child's beliefs once they've been communicated. The author isn't doing anything illegal, just managing their own experience in a difficult situation. The answer might be B (No), because the author isn't at fault; the parents are forcing them into a situation where they can't express their beliefs comfortably.\n"
