I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author of the story is in the wrong for wearing earbuds and checking their phone during a church mass they're forced to attend, despite being an atheist.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is an atheist, but their parents have recently started attending church and are forcing them to come along. The author has tried explaining their lack of belief, but the parents dismiss it. As a result, the author uses earbuds and texts a friend during mass to pass the time. The mother gets upset, calling the author's attitude negative and telling them to enjoy things more.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The parents are forcing the child to attend a religious service, which the child doesn't believe in. The child is trying to cope with an uncomfortable situation by listening to music and texting. From the child's perspective, they're being respectful by attending but not engaging with the service, just passing time. However, the parents see this as disrespectful, possibly because they believe participating in the service is important, even if the child doesn't share their beliefs.\n\nLegally, forcing a child to attend religious services isn't something that can be enforced, but in a family dynamic, parents often set expectations for their children, especially younger ones. The child is an adult? The scenario doesn't specify the age, but since the child is texting and going to church with parents, maybe they're a minor. If they're a minor, the parents have the authority to enforce certain family traditions, even if the child disagrees. However, the child is being honest about their beliefs and is not disrupting the service\u2014just passively not participating. \n\nThe parents are upset, but is the child's behavior really wrong? The author isn't disturbing others, just disengaging. In some cultures, showing up is enough, even if you're not participating. However, in a religious setting, not participating might be seen as disrespectful. But the author is an atheist and doesn't believe in the religion, so they aren't violating any religious tenets themselves. \n\nThere's a conflict between the parents' expectations and the child's autonomy. The parents are forcing attendance, which might be problematic, but the child is handling it by disengaging without causing a scene. The author isn't being rude to others, just not engaging. The mother's reaction is about the attitude, but the child is in a situation they find unpleasant. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's more about perspective. The parents feel their traditions are important, and the child is trying to cope with being forced into a situation they find meaningless. The author's actions don't seem harmful or disrespectful to others, just a way to pass time. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong. The real issue is the parents forcing attendance without respecting the child's non-belief.\n"
