I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the person is in the wrong here. The situation is that they're an atheist forced to go to church with their parents. They're wearing earbuds and texting during mass. Their mom is upset, saying they have a negative attitude.\n\nFirst, the parents are making them attend church, but the person doesn't believe and finds it unpleasant. They're using earbuds and texting as coping mechanisms. Is that wrong? Well, maybe it's a matter of respect. In a religious setting, even if you don't believe, there's an expectation of decorum. So, the parents might see the earbuds and texting as disrespectful, especially during a service. The parents could be at fault for forcing attendance, but the child's actions might also be seen as rude in that context. However, the person is an adult and might have the right to make their own choices, but since they're with family, there's a social aspect. The answer isn't clear-cut. I think both sides have points. But the question is whether the author is wrong. The parents forced them, but the author's actions during the service could be seen as disrespectful. So maybe the answer is A (they're in the wrong) because of the context of being in a church. But then again, if they're forced to attend, maybe their actions are a form of protest. Hmm, tricky. Alternatively, the parents are wrong for forcing attendance, but the author's actions are a response to that. But the question is specifically about the author's actions. If the parents are forcing attendance, maybe the author isn't wrong for trying to make the time pass. But in terms of social norms, being in a church and using earbuds/texting might still be considered disrespectful regardless of personal beliefs. So maybe the answer is A. But I'm a bit confused. Let me think again. If someone is in a place where they don't believe, but they're there physically, is it wrong to not participate? The parents might see it as disrespectful to their beliefs, but the child is not engaging. So maybe the answer is B (not in the wrong) because the parents forced them, and the child is just coping. But the action itself is still seen as disrespectful. The answer depends on the context of respect vs. forced attendance. I think the answer is A because the author's actions could be considered disrespectful in a religious setting, even if they're forced to be there. So, A.\n"
