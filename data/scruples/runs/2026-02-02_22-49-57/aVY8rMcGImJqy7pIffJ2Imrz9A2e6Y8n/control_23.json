I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they're forced to go to church with their parents every Sunday, even though they're an atheist. They brought earbuds and listened to music, texted a friend, and their mom gave them dirty looks and criticized their attitude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is an atheist, which means they don't believe in the religion their parents are practicing. But their parents are making them attend church. That's a form of pressure, right? So the author feels forced to be there, which probably makes them uncomfortable. They're using earbuds and texting as a way to cope with the situation. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, being in church and using earbuds might be seen as disrespectful by the parents, especially if they're participating in a religious service that values attention and participation. But the author isn't there by choice; they're being forced to attend. So their actions might be a form of protest or a way to deal with being in a place they disagree with. \n\nThe parents, on the other hand, might feel that even though the author doesn't share their beliefs, participating in family traditions is important. They might see the author's behavior as disrespectful to the institution or to their own religious practices. However, the parents are forcing the child to attend against their beliefs, which could be a problem in itself. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the author's communication. They've told their parents they don't believe and dislike attending, but the parents are ignoring that. The author might be acting out because they feel unheard or forced into something they don't want to do. \n\nI need to weigh the respect for parental wishes versus the right to personal autonomy. The parents want their child to participate in their religious practices, but the child is an adult (since they're texting and making their own choices) and might have the right to not participate. However, in some cultures or families, attending church together is a tradition, and the child's actions could be seen as disruptive. \n\nBut considering the author is an atheist and has communicated their stance, maybe their actions are a way to maintain their autonomy. The parents might need to respect the child's beliefs, even if they don't agree. So, who's at fault? The author isn't wrong for trying to cope with an uncomfortable situation they're forced into. The parents might be at fault for not respecting the child's beliefs and forcing attendance. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
