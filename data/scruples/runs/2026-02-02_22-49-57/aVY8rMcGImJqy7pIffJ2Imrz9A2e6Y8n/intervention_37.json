I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about an atheist being forced to attend church by their parents and using earbuds and texting during the mass. The author is wondering if their actions make them a bad person or if their parents are at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person is an atheist, which means they don't believe in the religion their parents are practicing. The parents are forcing them to attend church every Sunday, which the author clearly dislikes. They've tried explaining this to their parents, but the parents brush it off. So the author uses earbuds to listen to music and texts a friend during the mass. The mom gives dirty looks and criticizes their attitude.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The key points here are the concept of personal autonomy, the right to practice one's beliefs (or lack thereof), and the parents' insistence on forcing attendance. In many societies, individuals have the right to their own beliefs, and being forced to participate in religious activities against one's will can be seen as a form of pressure or coercion. The author's actions (using earbuds and texting) are ways to cope with the discomfort of being in a situation they find objectionable. However, from a social etiquette perspective, especially within the context of a religious service, there might be expectations to behave in a respectful manner regardless of personal beliefs.\n\nBut the parents are the ones forcing the attendance, which is problematic. The author isn't attending by choice, so their actions could be seen as a form of passive resistance. However, in some cultural or family contexts, such behavior might be considered disrespectful even if the person doesn't believe. The question is whether the author's actions are wrong given the circumstances.\n\nLegally, there's no issue here. The problem is more about moral or social expectations. If the family has strict rules about behavior during church, the author might be seen as violating those. But if the parents are enforcing attendance without respecting the child's autonomy, the fault might lie more with the parents for the initial coercion. The author's actions are a response to being forced into a situation they find unpleasant.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? On one hand, they're being disrespectful by not engaging with the service. On the other, they're reacting to being forced into a setting they don't agree with. The parents' actions in forcing attendance could be the root issue. The answer might depend on cultural norms and how one weighs the importance of respecting religious spaces versus respecting individual autonomy.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's actions might be seen as disrespectful in a public religious setting, the primary fault lies with the parents for forcing attendance. The author is in a difficult position, trying to cope with an unwanted situation. Therefore, the answer might be B (not in the wrong), considering the context of coercion and their right to personal autonomy.\n"
