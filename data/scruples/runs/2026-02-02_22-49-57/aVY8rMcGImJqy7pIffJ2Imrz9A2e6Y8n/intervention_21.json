I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong (AITA) for wearing earbuds and using their phone during a church service they're forced to attend. The author is an atheist, and their parents have recently started attending church more, forcing them to go every Sunday. The author has expressed their lack of belief multiple times, but the parents dismiss it and still make them come. During the mass, the author listens to music and texts a friend, leading to their mom being upset and criticizing their attitude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical angles here. The key points are the pressure from the parents and the author's actions in response. The parents are forcing attendance, which might not be appropriate if the child is an adult and has expressed their disinterest. The author's actions could be seen as disrespectful in a religious setting, but they're also reacting to being forced into a situation they don't agree with. \n\nIn many cultures, there's an expectation of respect during religious services, so using earbuds and texting might be seen as disrespectful. However, the author is in a position where they're being coerced, which complicates things. They might be acting out of frustration or as a form of passive resistance. \n\nOn the other hand, the parents might believe they're doing the right thing by exposing their child to their religious practices, even if the child isn't interested. But if the child is an adult, the parents should respect their autonomy. The author's actions could be a way of asserting their independence, especially after repeated dismissals of their beliefs.\n\nI need to weigh the respect for the parents' wishes against the right to personal autonomy and the appropriateness of the author's behavior in a public religious setting. The answer might depend on cultural norms and the specific dynamics of the family. However, given that the author is being forced to attend and has communicated their stance, their actions could be seen as a reasonable response to being put in an uncomfortable situation. The parents are at fault for not respecting the author's wishes, which might make the author's actions a form of necessary self-expression rather than being in the wrong.\n"
