I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. So the user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is an atheist forced to attend church with their parents. They wear earbuds and check their phone during the mass, which their mom didn't like. The parents don't care about the author's beliefs and keep forcing them to come. The author is wondering if they're being a bitch or if the parents are at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The parents are enforcing their religious practices without respecting the child's beliefs. The author has communicated their atheism multiple times but it's ignored. Then, during the mass, the author uses earbuds and texts, which the mom disapproves of. \n\nThe key points to analyze are: the parents' right to force their children to attend religious services, the author's right to personal choice and expression, and whether the author's actions are disrespectful or acceptable given the circumstances.\n\nIn many places, parents have the legal right to raise their children in a religious environment, but there's a difference between teaching and forcing attendance. However, the author's actions during the service\u2014using earbuds and phone\u2014could be seen as disrespectful to the religious practices of the church, even if they don't believe in it. But the parents are forcing them to attend, which could be seen as the root issue.\n\nOn one hand, the author is being passive-aggressive by using earbuds and texting, which might be disrespectful in a setting that values attention and participation. On the other hand, the parents are not respecting the author's beliefs and are forcing them into a situation where they're uncomfortable. \n\nThe author's explanation mentions they don't believe and dislike attending, so their actions might be a form of coping or resistance. However, in a public religious setting, even if forced to attend, one might be expected to at least appear respectful. The use of earbuds and phone could be seen as a disruption or lack of respect, regardless of personal beliefs.\n\nBut considering that the parents are the ones forcing attendance without considering their child's views, there's a fault there. The author's actions might be a justified response to being forced into an uncomfortable situation. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer might depend on cultural norms and expectations regarding respect in religious settings versus parental rights.\n\nIn some cultures, attending church as a family is a norm, and children are expected to participate regardless of their beliefs. In such contexts, the author's behavior might be seen as disrespectful. But if the parents are not respecting the child's autonomy and beliefs, that's a problem too.\n\nSo, balancing both sides, the parents are at fault for not respecting the child's autonomy, but the child's actions could also be seen as disrespectful in the church setting. However, since the parents are the ones forcing the situation, the main fault might lie with them, making the author not entirely in the wrong. But depending on societal expectations, the answer could vary.\n"
