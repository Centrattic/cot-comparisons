I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that they're an atheist being forced to attend church with their parents. They brought earbuds and listened to music, texted friends during the mass, and their mom gave them dirty looks and criticized their attitude. The author is asking if they're the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The parents are forcing the author to attend church despite their atheism. That's a key point. The author has communicated their lack of belief multiple times, but the parents are still making them go. So the situation is about parental control and the child's autonomy.\n\nNow, the author's actions: wearing earbuds and texting. In a church setting, especially during a mass, there's an expectation of quiet, reflection, and participation. Using earbuds might be seen as disrespectful because it's a communal event, and the parents might expect their child to be attentive. However, the author is there involuntarily. If they're being forced to attend something they disagree with, their actions could be a form of protest or coping mechanism.\n\nBut does that make it okay? Well, the parents are the ones forcing the situation, but the author is responding by disengaging. From the author's perspective, they're not in a place of belief, so they're trying to make the time bearable. But from the parents' view, they might feel disrespected. The mom's reaction is about the author's attitude, not just the actions.\n\nLegally or morally, is the author in the wrong? It's not a legal matter, but socially. In many cultures, church is a place where you're supposed to be respectful, regardless of your beliefs. So the author's actions might be seen as disrespectful in that context. But the parents are the ones forcing attendance, which is a problem of its own.\n\nSo there's a conflict here between parental authority and the child's autonomy and personal beliefs. The author isn't physically disruptive, just disengaged. Their mom's criticism is about attitude, which could be a valid point if respect is expected regardless of belief. But if the parents are forcing attendance without considering the child's feelings, that's part of the issue.\n\nI think the key factors are: the parents forcing attendance despite the author's clear disinterest, and the author trying to cope by disengaging. The author isn't necessarily in the wrong because they're being forced into a situation they don't agree with. However, their actions might be seen as disrespectful in that setting. But since the parents are the ones creating the conflict, the author's response is understandable. So I lean towards B (not in the wrong), but it's a nuanced situation where both sides have valid points.\n"
