I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about a person being forced to attend church by their parents, even though they're an atheist. They bring earbuds and check their phone during the service, which upsets their mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is an atheist and has communicated their beliefs to their parents, but they're still forced to attend. The parents are insistent, so the author is trying to cope by using earbuds and texting. \n\nNow, looking at cultural and religious norms. In many religious settings, especially church services, there are expected behaviors like not using phones and being attentive. The author's actions might be seen as disrespectful by the parents, who view the church as a sacred space. However, the author is in a situation where they feel forced to participate in something they don't believe in, which can be stressful and lead to a sense of dissonance.\n\nThe parents' reaction\u2014dirty looks and criticism about attitude\u2014suggests they see the behavior as disrespectful. But the author's justification is that they're being forced to attend against their beliefs. So, is the author in the wrong for trying to cope in an environment they find oppressive? \n\nOn one hand, using earbuds and texting during a sacred event might be considered inappropriate, regardless of personal beliefs. On the other hand, the author is dealing with a situation where their autonomy is being disregarded. The parents are forcing them to be part of a practice they don't agree with, which might justify the author's actions as a form of passive resistance or coping.\n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the parents have set rules for attending church, then the author's actions could be seen as breaking those rules, hence being in the wrong. However, if the parents are being overbearing and not respecting the author's beliefs, then the parents might be at fault for forcing the author to attend, making the author's response understandable.\n\nI think the key here is the concept of respect. Even if the author doesn't believe in the religious practices, showing respect for the parents' wishes and the setting might be expected. However, the parents are forcing the author into a situation where they can't express their beliefs or be true to themselves, which complicates things. \n\nIn some cultures, family expectations are very strong, and going against them might be seen as disrespectful. But the author's actions are a form of non-participation rather than active disrespect. They're not causing disruption, just engaging in personal activities. \n\nThe parents might feel that attending church as a family is important, and the author's behavior undermines that. But if the author is being forced, then their reaction is a conflict between their personal autonomy and family pressure. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author's actions might be seen as disrespectful in the context of the church service, the underlying issue is the parents forcing attendance against the author's beliefs. The author is not necessarily in the wrong for trying to cope, but their actions could be viewed as disrespectful. However, the main fault might lie with the parents for not respecting the author's autonomy and beliefs.\n"
