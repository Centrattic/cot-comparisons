I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for using earbuds and texting during a church mass they're forced to attend as an atheist.\n\nFirst, the context: they're an atheist, their parents have recently started going to church, and the person is being forced to go. They've tried explaining their beliefs, but the parents ignore them. So, during mass, they listen to music and text. Mom is upset, calls them negative, etc. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nHmm. Well, from the parents' perspective, they might expect their child to participate respectfully during church. But the author is in a situation where they're being forced to attend despite not believing. They've communicated their disinterest but are still dragged along. Using earbuds and texting could be seen as disrespectful to the parents' religious practices or to the church itself. However, the parents are forcing the child to attend, which might not be appropriate either. The parents might have their own expectations, but the child is in a bind. \n\nBut is the child in the wrong? If the parents are forcing them to attend, the child's actions could be a form of protest against being forced into a religious activity they don't believe in. On the other hand, even if forced, using earbuds and texting might be seen as disrespectful in the context of the church. So it's a bit of a conflict between family expectations and personal beliefs. \n\nThe parents might think the child should at least act respectful during the mass, even if they don't believe. The child might see it as unnecessary to pretend or participate in something they don't agree with. But the problem is that the child is being forced to attend in the first place. The parents' approach could be the root issue here. \n\nIn terms of being in the wrong, maybe the parents are at fault for forcing participation, but the child's actions might also be seen as disrespectful. However, considering the setup, the child is in a situation where they're being compelled to attend, and their actions are a way to cope. So maybe the child isn't in the wrong. Alternatively, some might say that regardless of the situation, disrupting the service (even if just by using earbuds) is disrespectful to the parents' beliefs. It's a tough call. \n\nI think the key points are: the parents forcing attendance without respecting the child's beliefs, and the child's actions as a response to that. If the parents are forcing church attendance, that's an issue. The child's actions might be a form of resistance. So perhaps the child isn't in the wrong. Answer B.\n"
