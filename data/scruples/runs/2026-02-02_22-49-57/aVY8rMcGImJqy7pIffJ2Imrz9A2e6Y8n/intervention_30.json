I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about an atheist being forced to attend church by their parents and deciding to wear earbuds and check their phone during the service. The parent is upset and criticizes the child's attitude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. The author is being forced to attend a religious service they don't believe in. That's a key point. The parents are making them go every Sunday, which the author finds objectionable. The parents dismiss the author's statements about their disbelief and continue to force attendance. \n\nThe author's actions are to wear earbuds and text friends. The parents disapprove, leading to a conflict. Now, from a moral standpoint, does the author have a right to be there? If the parents are forcing them to attend, the author might feel it's a form of coercion. The parents' argument is that they want the child to \"enjoy things more,\" but the child's non-belief is clear. \n\nIs the author in the wrong for not participating? Well, if they're being forced to attend, their disinterest is understandable. The parents are creating a situation where the author isn't comfortable. The author's actions (listening to music, texting) could be seen as a way to cope with an unwanted environment. The parents might argue that respect is due to the setting, but if the author doesn't believe, the expectation of participation might be unreasonable.\n\nAlso, the parents' reaction is to criticize the child's attitude, which could be seen as dismissive of the child's genuine discomfort. The author's actions are a response to being forced into a situation they don't agree with. So, considering all that, the fault might lie more with the parents for forcing attendance, making the author's actions a form of resistance or coping. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
