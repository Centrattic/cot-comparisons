I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that they're an atheist forced to attend church by their parents who are now interested in going to church. The author uses earbuds and texts during mass, and their mom is upset, calling them negative.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is an atheist and has communicated their lack of belief. Being forced to attend church is a key point here. The parents are making them go, which might be seen as infringing on their personal beliefs or autonomy. The author's actions\u2014listening to music and texting\u2014are ways to cope or pass the time since they're not interested in the service.\n\nNow, the question is about whether the author is at fault. Legally, no. But socially or morally? Well, in many cultures, showing respect for others' practices, even if you don't share them, is often expected. However, the parents are forcing the child to attend, which could be seen as the parents being at fault. The child's actions could be seen as a form of passive resistance or expressing their discomfort.\n\nThe mom's reaction is also important. She criticizes the child's attitude, but if the child has already stated their disbelief, maybe the parents aren't respecting their child's autonomy. The parents might need to accept that their child doesn't share their beliefs and that attending church is a family choice, not the child's. The child's actions are a response to being forced into a situation they're uncomfortable with.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the child should still respect the setting even if they don't agree. But given that it's forced, the child's actions are understandable. So, the answer would be B (not in the wrong), as the parents are forcing them into a situation and the child is reacting to that.\n"
