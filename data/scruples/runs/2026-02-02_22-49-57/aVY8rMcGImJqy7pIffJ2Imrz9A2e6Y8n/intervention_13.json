I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves attending a church mass against their will as an atheist, using earbuds and texting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is forced to attend church by their parents despite not believing in the religion. They've communicated their lack of belief multiple times. The parents are ignoring their wishes and forcing them to go. \n\nThe author's actions: wearing earbuds to listen to music and texting. In a church setting, especially during a mass, there's usually an expectation of quiet and respect. However, the key point here is that the author is being compelled to attend against their beliefs. \n\nFrom a legal standpoint, unless there's a specific law against using earbuds or phones in church, the author isn't breaking any laws. Ethically, it's more about personal beliefs. The parents are imposing their religious practices, which the author doesn't share. The author's actions might be seen as disrespectful in the context of the church, but given that they are forced to attend, their resistance through passive means (listening to music) could be seen as a form of coping under pressure.\n\nThe parents' reaction\u2014dirty looks and criticism about attitude\u2014suggests they see the behavior as disrespectful. However, the author has clearly stated their non-belief multiple times. The parents might be in the wrong for not respecting the author's autonomy and beliefs.\n\nConsidering all angles, the author's actions are a response to being forced into a situation they find objectionable. While the behavior might be frowned upon in the church setting, the underlying issue is the parents' insistence on attending church despite the author's objections. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong.\n"
