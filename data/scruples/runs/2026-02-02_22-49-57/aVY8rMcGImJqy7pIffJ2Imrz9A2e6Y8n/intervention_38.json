I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about an atheist being forced to attend church with their parents and reacting by wearing earbuds and texting during the service.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person is an atheist and has communicated their lack of belief to their parents. They\u2019re being forced to attend a church service they don't believe in. That's a form of pressure or maybe even coercion, depending on the parents' approach. The parents are continuing to drag them along despite the person's expressed disinterest and disbelief. \n\nNow, the person's actions: wearing earbuds to listen to music and texting during the mass. Is this acceptable behavior in a religious setting? Well, church services are typically considered places of worship where attendees are expected to show respect through certain behaviors, like not using phones or listening to music. So from a religious standpoint, the person might be seen as disrespectful. However, if they're being forced to attend against their beliefs, there's a conflict between their personal beliefs and the expectations of the environment they're in.\n\nThe parents are upset because the child is not adhering to the norms of the church, which could be seen as the child not respecting the institution they're being asked to attend. But on the flip side, the child is being forced to participate in something they don't believe in, which can be stressful and may lead to resentment. The child's actions could be a way of coping with an uncomfortable situation, but they might be perceived as rude or disrespectful by others present.\n\nLegally and morally, the parents have the right to take their child to church if they are the legal guardians, but there's a question about the child's autonomy, especially if they're an adult. If the child is an adult, forcing them to attend might be more about family pressure than actual authority. If the child is a minor, the parents do have the right to make such decisions, but the child's discomfort is still valid.\n\nThe parents' response\u2014calling the child a \"bitch\" or having a \"negative attitude\"\u2014might be an overreaction if the child has clearly communicated their disinterest. The parents aren't considering the child's feelings or the fact that they're being forced into a stressful situation. However, the child's actions during the service could be seen as a form of protest against the situation they're in, which might be justified given their lack of belief.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If we look at the situation from the parents' perspective, they might feel that the child is disrespectful. From the child's perspective, they're dealing with forced participation in something they don't believe in and are trying to cope. The answer hinges on whether the child's actions are seen as disrespectful despite their circumstances. If the child's actions are a direct result of being forced into a situation they disagree with, maybe they're not entirely at fault. However, in a public setting like a church, certain behaviors are expected, and deviating from them might be considered disrespectful regardless of the reason.\n\nBut considering the context of being forced to attend, the child's actions might be a reasonable response to their discomfort. The parents are at fault for forcing their child to attend against their beliefs, which is a more significant issue. The child's actions are a symptom of the larger problem of being coerced into a religious environment they don't want to be in. Therefore, the child is not in the wrong; the parents are, for not respecting the child's autonomy and beliefs.\n"
