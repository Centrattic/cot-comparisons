I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for using earbuds and texting during a church mass they're forced to attend, even though they're an atheist. The parent is asking for a judgment, so I need to consider both sides.\n\nFirst, the context: the author is an atheist being forced to attend church by their parents. They've communicated their lack of belief and dislike for attending, but the parents ignore that. The author uses earbuds to listen to music and texts a friend during the service. The mom is upset, calling them negative and tells them to enjoy things more.\n\nNow, the key points here. The parents are pressuring their child to attend a religious service they don't believe in. The child is trying to cope by disengaging, which is understandable. But in a church setting, using electronics like earbuds and texting can be seen as disrespectful. The parents might feel that even if the child doesn't believe, they should show respect for the environment and the family's wishes. However, the child's autonomy and right to not participate in a belief system they reject is also important. \n\nThe term \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) suggests the author is questioning their own actions. The parents are forcing attendance, which is a form of coercion, especially if the child is an adult. But the child's actions during the service might be considered rude, regardless of their beliefs. It's a balance between personal freedom and social respect. \n\nIn a public or family setting, like a church, there are usually unspoken rules of respect. Using earbuds and texting could be seen as disregarding those norms, even if the individual doesn't share the beliefs. The parents might feel that the child is being willfully disrespectful, hence the dirty looks and criticism about attitude. \n\nBut the child has a right to feel disengaged and find ways to cope with an uncomfortable situation. If they're not disrupting the service, maybe their actions are more about personal freedom. However, in some contexts, using electronics in such a setting is frowned upon, so there's a cultural expectation to follow. \n\nSo, the author is in a tough spot. They're being forced to attend, which is wrong if they're an adult. But their coping mechanism might be seen as disrespectful. The answer hinges on whether the actions themselves are inherently disrespectful, regardless of the individual's beliefs, or if the parents' coercion is the main issue here. \n\nI think the author is not in the wrong because the parents are the ones forcing them into a situation they don't agree with. The author is trying to make the best of a bad situation without causing a scene. However, others might argue that the respect for the setting is still necessary even if you don't believe. But given the circumstances of being forced, the author's actions are a reasonable way to cope, so the answer is B.\n"
