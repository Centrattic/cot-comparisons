I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The question is whether the person (AITA) is in the wrong for using earbuds and texting during a church mass they're forced to attend, even though they're an atheist.\n\nFirst, the context: The parents have started going to church more recently and are forcing the child to attend every Sunday. The child has communicated their atheism multiple times, but the parents ignore this and still make them go. The child then uses earbuds to listen to music and texts a friend occasionally. The mom gets angry and says the child has a negative attitude.\n\nSo, the core issue is about autonomy vs. parental authority. The parents are making the child attend a religious service where they don't believe. The child is trying to cope by using their earbuds and staying connected with a friend. From a rights perspective, the child's right to personal freedom and expression might be in play here. The parents might argue that the child should respect the family's time and participate in the activity as a way to bond or follow family traditions. However, the child is being forced to attend a place they don't believe in, which can be stressful and maybe even respectful to their own beliefs to not participate in a way that feels fake or forced.\n\nReligious practices often have their own rules about behavior during services. For example, in some churches, using phones might be considered disrespectful. However, the child is in a situation where they're not there by choice. The parents are making them attend, so the child's actions could be seen as a way to reclaim some autonomy. On the other hand, the parents might see the child's behavior as a lack of respect for the family's religious practice, even if the child isn't a believer.\n\nAnother angle: The parents might be using the church attendance as a way to instill their values, but if the child has consistently stated their atheism, maybe the parents aren't respecting the child's autonomy. The child's actions (using earbuds and texting) could be a form of resistance against being forced to attend, which is a way to cope with the situation. However, in the eyes of the parents, this might come across as disrespectful or ungrateful, hence the comment about having a negative attitude.\n\nSo, is the child in the wrong? Well, if the parents are forcing attendance, the child's actions might be a way to cope with a situation they don't want to be in. The parents, on the other hand, might feel that the child isn't respecting the family's wishes and the sanctity of the service. However, the key point is that the child is an atheist and has communicated that. The parents forcing them to attend might be the initial issue. If the child is in a religious environment they don't believe in, using earbuds to listen to their own music could be seen as a way to make the time more bearable. Texting a friend might be a way to pass the time and stay connected, which isn't inherently disrespectful, but it could be seen as disruptive in a place where silence and attention are expected.\n\nLegally or ethically, the parents have a right to make their child attend religious services if that's part of their family tradition, but the child also has a right to express their discomfort. However, the parents might not be respecting the child's autonomy by forcing them to attend. The child's actions are a form of non-compliant behavior in a setting they're being forced into, which could be justified as a way to assert their personal boundaries.\n\nIn some religious contexts, using phones during services is indeed considered disrespectful, but if the child is there involuntarily, that expectation might not apply. The parents might be conflating the child's actions with a general attitude problem, when in reality, the child is reacting to being forced into an activity they find meaningless or even offensive.\n\nSo, considering all that, the child might not be in the wrong because they're acting in a way to maintain their own mental well-being in a situation they don't consent to. The parents might need to reconsider why they're forcing the child to attend if the child is not a believer. The child's actions are a response to a stressful, imposed situation. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
