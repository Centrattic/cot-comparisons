I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the question is in the wrong for wearing earbuds and checking their phone during a church mass they're forced to attend as an atheist.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person is an atheist and is being forced to attend church by their parents. They've communicated their lack of belief multiple times, but the parents still insist they come. So the person is in a situation they're uncomfortable with.\n\nThey brought earbuds and listened to music, also texting a friend during the service. The mom was upset, gave dirty looks, and later criticized their attitude. The question is about who's at fault here.\n\nFrom a religious perspective, church services are typically considered sacred spaces where attention is given to worship. In many religious settings, using phones or listening to music might be seen as disrespectful. However, the person is an atheist and doesn't believe in the practices. They feel forced into attending, which adds another layer. \n\nThe parents are insisting on their tradition, which is their right as parents, but maybe they should have considered the child's feelings. The child is trying to cope with an uncomfortable situation, which is understandable. But the method they chose (earbuds and texting) might be seen as disruptive or disrespectful from the parents' viewpoint, even if the child isn't religious.\n\nIs the child wrong for not respecting the setting? Maybe, because they are in a place that requires certain etiquette, regardless of personal beliefs. However, the parents forcing attendance without respecting the child's autonomy could also be at fault. \n\nBut the question is specifically about whether the author is in the wrong. The parents may be wrong for forcing attendance, but the author's actions of using earbuds and texting could be seen as disrespectful in that context. The child's lack of belief might mitigate the intention, but the behavior itself could be considered inconsiderate. However, the parents' insistence on their practices without considering the child's well-being also plays a role.\n\nIn some cases, people attend events they don't believe in for family reasons but try to be respectful. The author's actions show a lack of effort to conform to the environment's expected behavior, which might be seen as inconsiderate towards their parents' wishes. Even if they don't believe, being present without disruptions could be a sign of respect for the parents' beliefs, even if they disagree.\n\nSo, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting their parents' wishes and the setting's norms, even if they're being forced to attend. The parents are also wrong for forcing attendance, but the question is about the author's actions. Therefore, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A).\n"
