I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong.\n\nSo the scenario is that the author is an atheist forced by their parents to attend church services every Sunday. They brought earbuds to listen to music and texted a friend during the mass. The parents are upset, saying the author has a negative attitude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is being forced to attend a religious service they don't believe in. They're using earbuds and texting to pass the time. The parents are unhappy with the behavior, but the author finds the situation unpleasant and doesn't agree with the religious practices.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to evaluate based on typical social norms and respect for religious practices. \n\nForced attendance in religious services can be controversial, especially when the individual doesn't believe in the religion. The parents have a right to their beliefs, but forcing a child to attend against their will might infringe on the child's autonomy. The author's actions (using earbuds, texting) might be seen as disrespectful in the context of a religious service, but if the person is being forced to attend, their actions could be a form of coping or protest.\n\nReligious services often expect participants to be attentive and respectful. Listening to music and texting could be seen as disruptive or disrespectful. However, if the individual is there against their will and not participating in the service, their presence is already a compromise. The parents might expect the child to at least appear respectful, even if they don't believe, for the sake of the community or the parents' comfort.\n\nBut from the author's perspective, being forced into a situation they find meaningless and using earbuds/texting as a way to endure it could be understandable. They might feel that they should be able to handle their time as they see fit in that space, even if it's considered disrespectful. However, the parents might see it as a lack of respect for their beliefs and the institution.\n\nIt's a bit of a gray area. Legally, the parents can require their children (if they're minors) to attend services due to parental rights, but ethically, it's more complex. The author's actions could be seen as disrespectful in a religious setting, but the fact that they're being forced there might mitigate that. The parents' response could be seen as invalidating the author's beliefs and autonomy.\n\nIn similar situations, respect for differing beliefs and the context of the setting often play a role. If the author is not participating in the service, maybe the minimal expectation is to be quiet and not disruptive. Using earbuds is less disruptive than texting, which could be more noticeable. However, in a public setting like church, even quiet texting might be seen as impolite.\n\nConsidering all this, the author's actions might be seen as disrespectful in the context of the church, but the parents are also forcing them into a situation they don't want to be in. The parents might be at fault for not respecting the author's beliefs and autonomy, which leads the author to act out. However, from the parents' side, they might feel entitled to their traditions and expect respect for their practices, even if the child doesn't share the beliefs.\n\nIn the end, it's a balance between respecting the parents' wishes and the author's autonomy. If the author is an adult, the dynamics might differ from a child. But since the author mentions being forced by parents, it's likely they're a minor. The answer might depend on cultural norms and the specific family's values. However, generally, the author's actions could be seen as inconsiderate in a religious setting, but the parents' enforcement of attendance is also problematic. So the fault might be shared, but if forced to choose, maybe the author is partially in the wrong for the disruptive behavior, but the parents are also at fault for the forced attendance. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If the parents are forcing them to attend, perhaps the author's actions are a form of resistance and not entirely in the wrong. But in the context of the church, the actions might still be seen as disrespectful.\n"
