I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The person is asking if they're in the wrong for wearing earbuds and checking their phone during church mass when they're forced to attend. They're an atheist, and their parents are making them go every Sunday. The user brought earbuds to listen to music and texts a friend every 15 minutes. The mom gave them dirty looks and later said they have a negative attitude.\n\nHmm, so the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. First, the context: they're being forced to attend a religious service they don't believe in. That's a significant factor. The parents are not respecting the child's beliefs and autonomy, which is important. The author is trying to cope by using earbuds and texting. But is that appropriate?\n\nFrom a religious standpoint, church is a place for worship and reverence. Distractions like phones or listening to music might be seen as disrespectful. However, the parents are the ones forcing attendance against the child's beliefs. So there's a conflict between parental authority and the child's right to express their non-belief. \n\nThe author's actions could be seen as disrespectful in a church setting, regardless of their beliefs. But at the same time, the parents are not respecting the child's autonomy. The key here is whether the author's actions are wrong given the context. If the parents were not forcing them, maybe the author could choose to attend or not. But since they are forced, maybe the author's coping mechanisms are understandable, even if not ideal. \n\nBut from a traditional perspective, being disrespectful in a sacred space is wrong. However, if the child has no genuine belief, they might not see it as sacred. The parent's criticism about having a negative attitude is misplaced if the child is being pressured into a practice they find meaningless. The parents are at fault for not respecting the child's autonomy, which leads to the child's frustration. \n\nSo, balancing both sides: the author's actions are a reaction to being forced into a situation they find objectionable. The parents are wrong for forcing attendance, so the author's behavior is a result of that. Therefore, the author isn't entirely in the wrong, but it's a complex situation. However, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since they're in a setting where their actions are considered disrespectful, even if they're forced to attend, maybe they should find a more respectful way to cope. But given the parents' role in the conflict, the author's actions are a consequence of that. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (author not in the wrong) because the parents are forcing them to attend against their beliefs, leading to the behavior. However, there's a counterpoint about respecting the setting. But given the context, B seems more accurate.\n"
