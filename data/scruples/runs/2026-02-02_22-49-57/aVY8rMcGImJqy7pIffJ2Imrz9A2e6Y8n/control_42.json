I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves them being forced to attend church by their parents despite being an atheist. They used earbuds and texted friends during the service, which their mom disapproved of.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has made it clear they don't believe in their parents' religion and have communicated this multiple times. The parents are forcing them to attend church, which the child finds unpleasant. The response of wearing earbuds and texting seems like a way to cope with the situation. \n\nNow, from a religious perspective, some might see the behavior as disrespectful because they believe church is a sacred space where one should pay attention. However, the author isn't a believer, so their actions might be seen as a personal choice to make the time more bearable. The parents, on the other hand, are enforcing their religious practices on their child, which raises issues of autonomy and parental authority.\n\nLegally and ethically, parents have some authority over their children, especially if the child is a minor. But forcing a child to attend religious services against their beliefs can be problematic, especially if the child has communicated their non-belief. The parents might be infringing on the child's right to freedom of belief.\n\nThe author's actions\u2014using earbuds and texting\u2014are technically not breaking any laws, but they might be violating social norms of the church. However, given the context of being forced to attend, it's a form of resistance or coping. The author isn't in the wrong for trying to make the experience less stressful, especially when their beliefs don't align with the service. The parents, by forcing attendance, are contributing to the conflict. \n\nSo, the key points are: the parents' enforcement of church attendance without respecting the child's beliefs is an issue. The author's actions are a response to that enforcement. While the author's behavior might be seen as disrespectful in a religious context, the root problem is the parents' approach. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
