I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. They're an atheist forced to go to church by their parents. They're wearing earbuds and texting during mass, which upsets their mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider cultural and religious norms. In many churches, especially traditional ones, people are expected to be attentive and participate in the service. Using earbuds and checking a phone might be seen as disrespectful. But the person is an atheist and doesn't believe in the religion, so their actions could be a form of rebellion or coping mechanism. \n\nThe parents are forcing them to attend, which might be part of the issue. If the parents are imposing their religious practices without respecting the adult child's beliefs, that's a problem. The person might feel they have no choice but to attend, so their behavior could be a way to cope with the situation. However, from the parents' perspective, they might see the child's actions as disrespectful to the church and their beliefs.\n\nAlso, the age of the person matters. If they're an adult, their autonomy is more important. If they're a minor, parents might have more authority. The situation doesn't specify age, but since they can attend church against their will, maybe they're an adult. \n\nThe key points are: the person's right to practice their (non)beliefs vs. the parents' right to enforce their religious practices. The person is clearly not buying into the religion, so their actions might be justified as a way to deal with being forced into an environment they disagree with. However, in many social contexts, even if you don't believe, being respectful in someone else's religious practice is expected. So there's a conflict between personal autonomy and respect for others' beliefs.\n\nI think the answer is B (not in the wrong) because they're being honest about their beliefs and the parents are forcing them into a situation they don't agree with. The person's actions are a form of self-expression in a context they find oppressive. However, some might argue that they should still be respectful. But since the parents are the ones forcing them to attend without considering their beliefs, the fault lies more with the parents.\n"
