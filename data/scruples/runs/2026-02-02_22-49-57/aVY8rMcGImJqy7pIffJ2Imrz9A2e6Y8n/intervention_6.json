I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author being forced to attend church with their parents despite being an atheist. They wore earbuds and checked their phone during mass, which led to their mom giving dirty looks and criticizing their attitude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points here. The author is an atheist, so their disbelief is genuine. They've communicated this to their parents multiple times, but the parents still force them to attend church. The author's actions of listening to music and texting are forms of coping with being in an uncomfortable environment. The parents are enforcing their religious practices on their child, which might conflict with the child's autonomy and beliefs.\n\nFrom a rights perspective, individuals have the freedom of religion, including the right to not believe. Forcing someone to participate in religious activities against their will could be seen as a violation of that right. The author's actions are a form of non-compliance, which isn't inherently wrong if they're respecting their own beliefs. However, the parents might argue that they want to instill tradition or values, but the child's autonomy is also important here.\n\nAnother angle is the social context. In many cultures, attending religious services is a family activity, and disrupting it with earbuds and texting might be seen as disrespectful in that setting. However, the author's perspective is that they're being forced into a situation they disagree with, so their actions are a form of personal resistance. The parents' criticism of the author's attitude suggests a lack of understanding or acceptance of the child's atheism.\n\nI should also consider whether the author's actions are rude or disrespectful. While using earbuds and phones in church is generally frowned upon, the underlying issue is the forced attendance. If the author is in a public space and not causing a disturbance, their actions might be seen as a personal choice rather than a public disruption. However, the parents' expectations and the social norms of the church community could influence how their actions are judged.\n\nIn terms of responsibility, the parents are forcing the child to attend, which creates a conflict. The child's response is a reaction to that pressure. It's a conflict between parental authority and personal autonomy. Depending on cultural norms, the balance can shift. In some cultures, parents have significant authority, but in others, individual choice is prioritized.\n\nLooking at the question again, the user says the author isn't in the wrong. They might be emphasizing the parents' fault for forcing attendance. The answer hinges on whether the author's actions are justified given the circumstances. Since the parents are the ones enforcing the attendance against the child's wishes, the child's resistance is a natural response. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because they're asserting their own beliefs and autonomy in a situation imposed upon them.\n"
