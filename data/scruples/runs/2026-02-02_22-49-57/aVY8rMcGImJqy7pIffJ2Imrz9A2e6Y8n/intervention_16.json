I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The question is about whether it's acceptable for them to use earbuds and check their phone during a church service they don't believe in and are forced to attend.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person is an atheist, so they don't share the religious beliefs of their parents. They're being forced to attend church, which they don't want to do. They've communicated this to their parents, but the parents still insist. In response, the author uses earbuds to listen to music and texts a friend during the mass. The mother reacts negatively, giving dirty looks and later criticizing the author's attitude.\n\nNow, from a religious or cultural standpoint, church services are typically considered solemn and respectful events. Distractions like using a phone or listening to music could be seen as disrespectful. However, the author isn't there by choice and is being compelled to attend. The parents aren't just taking them to church; they're forcing them to stay the entire time, even though the author doesn't believe in the religion or enjoy it.\n\nThe core issue here is the conflict between the parents' desire for the child to attend and the child's lack of belief and unwillingness to participate. The author's actions might be seen as a form of protest or a way to cope with an unpleasant situation. But is that justified? On one hand, the author is being disrespectful to the religious setting. On the other, they're being forced to be in an environment they find meaningless and are reacting to that pressure by disengaging.\n\nAnother angle is the parents' role. They're the ones forcing the child to attend, which might be seen as overstepping, especially if the child has already expressed their lack of belief. The parents' criticism of the child's attitude could be an example of not respecting the child's autonomy and feelings. If the parents were more understanding of the child's perspective, perhaps the situation would be different.\n\nBut the question is specifically whether the author is in the wrong. Even if the parents are being unreasonable, is the author justified in their actions? In a public space like a church, certain norms are expected. Using earbuds and a phone might disrupt others or show disrespect, even if the person isn't there for the service. However, the author's actions are passive; they aren't causing a disturbance but are disengaging. It's possible that in some contexts, this is acceptable, but in a religious service, it might be frowned upon.\n\nI think the key here is the intention. The author isn't there to participate and is using the time to do something else. But the parents' insistence on attendance and the author's resulting disengagement both contribute to the conflict. The author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate, but they're also a response to being forced into a situation they dislike. It's a bit of a gray area. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and given that the parents are the ones forcing the attendance, I might lean towards the author not being in the wrong, but there's a counterargument about respecting the environment they're in.\n"
