I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the given situation is in the wrong. The author is an atheist forced to attend church with their parents, and during the service, they wore earbuds and checked their phone. Their mom was upset and said they have a negative attitude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author has communicated their lack of belief and dislike for attending church, but the parents still force them to go. The author is using earbuds and texting as a way to cope with being in an environment they find disagreeable. \n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. On one hand, from a religious perspective, being disrespectful in a sacred space could be seen as inappropriate. But the author is not part of that religion and feels forced to attend. Their actions might be seen as a way to maintain their autonomy in a situation they find uncomfortable.\n\nThe parents' reaction is about the child not showing the right attitude, but if the child doesn't believe, how can they be expected to show the right attitude? The parents are forcing attendance despite the child's beliefs. The author isn't disrupting the service; they're just using earbuds and texting, which might be quiet activities. \n\nI think the key here is the forced attendance versus the child's right to express their discomfort. The parents might be at fault for not respecting the child's beliefs, while the author is just trying to handle a situation they're being forced into. So, the answer would lean towards the author not being in the wrong.\n"
