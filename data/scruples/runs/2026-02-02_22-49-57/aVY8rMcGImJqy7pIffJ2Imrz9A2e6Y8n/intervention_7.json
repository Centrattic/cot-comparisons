I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for using earbuds and texting during a church service they were forced to attend. The author is an atheist and has been told multiple times that they don't believe in the religion, yet their parents still force them to go to mass.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is being compelled to attend a religious service that they personally don't believe in. That's a key point. Being forced to attend a place where you don't share the beliefs can be stressful. The parents are not allowing the child to opt out, which could be seen as infringing on their autonomy, especially if the child is an adult. \n\nNow, the actions in question: using earbuds to listen to music and texting. In many religious settings, especially during services, there's an expectation of quiet participation and respect. Using earbuds might be seen as disrespectful because it's a way of tuning out the service. Texting could also be viewed as distracting and unrespectful, as it's a form of multitasking during a time meant for reflection or worship.\n\nBut the parent's role here is also important. If the parents are forcing the child to attend, they might be contributing to the child's frustration. The child's response\u2014using earbuds and texting\u2014might be a way to cope with being in a situation they find uncomfortable or meaningless. However, from the parents' perspective, especially in some religious communities, showing disinterest through such actions could be perceived as disrespectful or rebellious, regardless of the child's beliefs.\n\nAnother angle is the age of the person. If they're a minor, the parents have authority. If they're an adult, the situation might be different. The scenario doesn't specify, but the fact that they're being \"forced\" to attend suggests they might be under 18. However, even then, the tension between parental authority and the child's autonomy is present.\n\nThe parents' reaction\u2014dirty looks and criticism about attitude\u2014indicates they see the behavior as negative. The child's explanation is that they don't believe and dislike attending, which the parents have been aware of. This suggests a clash between the parents' expectations and the child's reality.\n\nIn terms of cultural norms, in some religious contexts, any form of disengagement during the service is frowned upon. In others, personal coping mechanisms might be more accepted. The use of earbuds and texting could be seen as a breach of social etiquette in that specific setting.\n\nSo, evaluating the author's actions: are they in the wrong? If they're being forced to attend, their behavior might be a form of passive resistance. However, the setting is one where certain behaviors are expected, and deviating from those might be seen as disrespectful regardless of the reason. The parents are enforcing their values, and the child is reacting to that enforcement.\n\nBut also, if the child has made their beliefs clear and is still being forced to attend, their actions could be a way to assert their autonomy. However, in the context of the church service, that assertion might be perceived as disrespectful.\n\nSo, considering all factors, the author's actions might be seen as inconsiderate or disrespectful in the specific setting, but the root issue is the parents' insistence on attending against the child's wishes. The answer hinges on whether the setting's expectations outweigh the child's right to autonomy in that situation.\n"
