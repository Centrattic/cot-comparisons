I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about them being forced to attend church by their parents, even though they're an atheist. They wear earbuds and check their phone during the mass, which makes their mom upset.\n\nSo, first, I need to figure out the key points here. The person is an atheist but is forced to go to church with their parents. They've communicated their lack of belief and dislike for attending, but the parents ignore that. In response, the person uses earbuds and texts a friend. The mom then criticizes their attitude.\n\nThe core issue here is about autonomy and respect. The parents are forcing the child to participate in religious activities against their beliefs, which might be a form of coercion. The child is reacting by disengaging from the service through music and texting, which the parents disapprove of. \n\nI should consider cultural and familial norms. In some families, attending church is a tradition, and parents might expect participation from all members. However, the child's right to their own beliefs and the parents' right to enforce their traditions can clash. \n\nThe question is whether the child is wrong for disengaging. If the parents are forcing them to attend, the child's actions could be seen as a form of protest against being forced to participate in something they don't believe in. On the flip side, the parents might see the child's behavior as disrespectful to the church and the family's time together.\n\nBut since the child has already stated their atheism and the parents are ignoring that, the child's actions might be a necessary way to cope with an uncomfortable situation. The parents, by forcing attendance, might be the ones causing the conflict here. The child's use of earbuds and texting could be a way to manage their time during an event they don't agree with, which isn't inherently disrespectful unless the environment requires active participation (like a classroom or a meeting where they're expected to listen). In a church setting, while some might find it disrespectful to not participate, others might understand it's a personal choice, especially if the individual doesn't share the beliefs.\n\nThe mom's criticism about a negative attitude is ironic because the root issue is the parents forcing the child to attend. The child's actions are a response to that pressure. So, the blame might lie more with the parents for not respecting the child's beliefs and for enforcing attendance, leading the child to disengage as a form of self-preservation.\n\nTherefore, the answer is likely B (the author is not in the wrong), as the parents are forcing them into a situation they don't agree with, and the child's actions are a reaction to that pressure, not inherently disrespectful unless there's a specific expectation to participate.\n"
