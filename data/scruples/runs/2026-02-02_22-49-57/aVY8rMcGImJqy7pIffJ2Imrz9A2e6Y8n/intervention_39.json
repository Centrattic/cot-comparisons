I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about someone being forced to attend church by their parents despite being an atheist. The person is wearing earbuds and texting during the service, and their mom is upset.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is an atheist but is being forced to attend church. They've already communicated their lack of belief, but the parents don't listen. The action here is using earbuds and texting during the mass. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, from the parents' perspective, they might see the behavior as disrespectful, especially in a religious setting. But from the author's viewpoint, they're being made to attend a place they don't believe in and are trying to cope by engaging in their own activities. \n\nI should think about whether the author's actions are justified given the forced attendance. If they're not believing in the religion and are being compelled to attend, maybe their actions are a form of self-preservation or protest. However, there's a cultural aspect too\u2014attending a religious service where you don't believe might have social expectations. But since they're being forced, maybe the expectations don't apply. \n\nAlso, the parents are being dismissive of the author's beliefs and their discomfort. The author's response (earbuds and texting) could be seen as rude, but given the context of being forced into an environment they find meaningless, maybe it's understandable. The author is trying to make the time bearable, even if it's disrespectful to the parents. \n\nI need to decide if the author's actions are a reasonable reaction to being forced into a situation they disagree with. The key here is the forced attendance. If the parents were respecting the author's beliefs, they wouldn't force them to come. The author's actions might be seen as a way to cope with the situation. \n\nI think the answer leans towards B (the author is not in the wrong) because the parents are not respecting the author's beliefs and forcing them into an environment where they don't fit in. The author's actions are a response to that pressure. But there's a nuance here about respect in a public setting. However, since the author is being forced, the expectation of respect might be misplaced. So, the answer would be B.\n"
