I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for using earbuds and texting during church mass when forced to attend by their parents. The parents are religious and seem to not take the child's atheism seriously, continuing to force attendance despite prior discussions.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is an atheist, so attending church is against their beliefs. They've communicated this to their parents, but the parents still insist on bringing them. The author is in a situation where they're being forced to participate in a religious activity they don't believe in. That alone is a significant factor. Being forced to attend without consent can be a form of coercion, which is problematic.\n\nNow, the actions in question: using earbuds and texting. Using earbuds during a church service is generally seen as disrespectful because it's a place of worship where listening to the service is expected. However, the author is there against their will, so is it fair to judge their choice to disengage? The parents are forcing their presence, so the author's disengagement could be a form of protest or coping mechanism. \n\nTexting might be more problematic. It's not just about hearing the service; it's about not being present. But again, the author is in a situation where they don't agree with the practice. The parents' reaction\u2014dirty looks and criticism about attitude\u2014might stem from their belief that attending church is important, and the child's disengagement is seen as disrespectful. But is the child at fault when they're being forced to attend?\n\nLegally and ethically, forcing someone to attend religious services can be an issue, especially if it's against their beliefs. However, in many places, parents can choose to take their children to religious services unless there's a legal issue. The key here is the child's age and the nature of the coercion. If the child is an adult, they might have more autonomy, but the scenario doesn't specify. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, the parents are not respecting the child's beliefs and autonomy by forcing attendance. The child's actions could be seen as a response to that lack of respect. However, public disengagement (like using earbuds and texting) might be considered disrespectful in the context of the church setting, even if the child is there against their will. \n\nBut is the child in the wrong? The parents are forcing them into a situation, so the child's disengagement is a way to cope. The parents, by not respecting the child's beliefs, are creating the conflict. The child's actions are a form of resistance. So the parents are at fault for forcing participation, and the child is not in the wrong for disengaging in a space they're being coerced into attending.\n"
