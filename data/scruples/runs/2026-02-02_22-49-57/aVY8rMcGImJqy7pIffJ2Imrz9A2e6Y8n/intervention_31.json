I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is an atheist forced to attend church with their parents, and they used earbuds and checked their phone during the mass. The parents are upset, saying the author has a negative attitude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider both sides. The author is being forced to attend something they don't believe in, which is a form of pressure. They're using earbuds and texting as a way to cope with being there against their will. The parents, on the other hand, view this as disrespectful. \n\nNow, from a moral standpoint, forcing someone to attend religious services they don't believe in can be considered coercive, especially if they've expressed their lack of belief multiple times. The author's actions are a form of resistance or coping mechanism. However, during a church service, using earbuds and texting might be seen as disrespectful to the religious practices of others present. \n\nBut wait, the author is there reluctantly. Their actions are personal and not necessarily disruptive to others. The main conflict is between the parents' expectations and the author's right to personal autonomy. In many cases, respecting someone's autonomy is important, even if it leads to conflict. \n\nThe parents' response\u2014dirty looks and criticism\u2014might be seen as invalidating the author's feelings. The author isn't causing harm beyond their own actions, which in a personal context like a church service, where individual behavior can be a personal choice, might not be entirely wrong. \n\nConsidering all this, the answer is likely B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because they're acting within their rights to cope with being in a situation they're uncomfortable with, and the parents are at fault for forcing them to attend against their beliefs.\n"
