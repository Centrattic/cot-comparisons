I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about someone being forced to attend church with their parents even though they're an atheist. They used earbuds and texted during the service, which their mom disapproved of.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is an atheist and has communicated this to their parents. The parents are forcing them to attend church, which the author finds objectionable. The action in question is using earbuds and texting during mass. \n\nFrom a religious perspective, disrupting the service might be seen as disrespectful. But the key here is that the author is being forced to attend an event that conflicts with their beliefs. They\u2019re not there by choice. So, does that make their actions justified? Well, they\u2019re trying to cope with an unwanted situation. \n\nThe parents, on the other hand, are enforcing a cultural or religious practice, but they\u2019re not respecting the child's autonomy and personal beliefs. The author's actions could be seen as a form of resistance against being forced into an environment they find meaningless or even uncomfortable.\n\nBut there's a balance between personal freedom and respecting others. However, in this case, since the author isn't participating in the religious aspects (they\u2019re not praying, joining in hymns, etc.), just using earbuds and texting might not be as disruptive as it seems. Plus, the parents are the ones who are forcing the attendance, which is a bigger issue.\n\nSo, considering the forced participation and the author's attempts to cope with an oppressive situation, it's more about the parents being in the wrong for not respecting the child's beliefs. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
