I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is an atheist, forced to attend church by their parents, and they wear earbuds and check their phone during mass. The parents are upset, and the author is wondering if they're being a \"bitch\" or if the parents are at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is being forced to attend a religious event they don't believe in. That's a key point. Being forced to participate in something you disagree with, especially in matters of personal belief, is a significant factor here. The parents are requiring their child to attend, which could be seen as infringing on the child's autonomy and personal beliefs. \n\nThen, the author's actions: listening to music and texting. In a church setting, especially during a mass, there are social expectations of respect and attentiveness, even if one doesn't share the beliefs. However, the author is in a space where they feel they don't belong and are being forced to be there. So their actions could be a way to cope with the situation or protest the forced attendance. \n\nBut does that make their actions wrong? Well, from a social etiquette standpoint, in a religious service, it's generally considered disrespectful to be on a phone or wearing earbuds. But the author is in a situation of coercion. They are not there by choice. The parents are forcing them, which complicates the social expectations. The author's actions might be seen as a form of resistance or a way to handle the stress of being in an unwanted environment.\n\nThe parents, on the other hand, are using their authority to impose their beliefs or practices on their child, which can be problematic, especially if the child has clearly communicated their lack of belief. The parents' reaction\u2014dirty looks and criticism about having a negative attitude\u2014seems to dismiss the child's feelings and autonomy. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on the perspective. If we consider the social norms of the church, the author is being disrespectful. But if we look at the context of coercion and the child's right to autonomy and personal belief, the parents might be in the wrong for forcing attendance. The author's actions are a response to being forced into a situation they find uncomfortable or meaningless. \n\nI think the key here is the forced attendance. If someone is required to be in a place where they don't belong, their actions to cope might be understandable, even if they technically go against the social norms of that place. The parents' insistence on control over the child's time and activities, despite the child's clear objections, is problematic. The author's actions are a form of asserting their own autonomy in a situation where they feel their autonomy is being stripped away.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be that the author is not in the wrong. The parents are at fault for forcing their child to attend an event the child finds meaningless and then criticizing the child for trying to cope. The answer should be B.\n"
