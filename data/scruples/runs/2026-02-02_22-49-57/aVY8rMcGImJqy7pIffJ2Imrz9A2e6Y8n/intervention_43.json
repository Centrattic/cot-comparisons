I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. The scenario is about an atheist being forced to attend church with their parents and then using earbuds and texting during the service. The parents are upset, giving dirty looks and criticizing the person's attitude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of the author. They're an atheist, so they don't believe in the religion, and they don't want to be there. They've communicated this to their parents multiple times. The parents are forcing them to attend, which the author finds unpleasant. To cope, they use earbuds and text friends. \n\nFrom the author's standpoint, they're dealing with a situation where their autonomy is being challenged. They might feel that their discomfort is valid, especially since they've made their beliefs clear. Using earbuds and texting could be seen as a way to occupy themselves in a space they find unwelcome. The parents, on the other hand, might see the author's actions as disrespectful to the church and their religious practices. \n\nNow, considering cultural and religious norms, many churches expect attendees to be attentive and respectful during services. Using electronic devices or listening to music might be viewed as disruptive or a sign of disrespect. However, the author's parents are forcing them to attend against their beliefs, which could be seen as a conflict between parental authority and the child's personal freedom.\n\nThe key points here are the forced attendance and the child's right to express discomfort. If the parents are not respecting the child's beliefs and the child is not harming others beyond personal behavior (like using earbuds, which don't affect others), then the fault might lie with the parents for the pressure. However, in many societies, parents do have authority over their children until a certain age, and the child might be expected to comply with family traditions even if they disagree. \n\nBut the child is an adult? Wait, the original post says \"AITA\" which is a forum where people discuss if they're the asshole. The person might be a teenager or an adult. If they're an adult, then the parents' expectation to attend church against their will is more questionable. If they're a minor, the parents have more authority, but even then, forcing attendance might be considered overstepping if the child's beliefs are being ignored.\n\nThe author's actions: using earbuds and texting. If they're in a private space, maybe, but in a public religious setting, some might see it as disrespectful. However, if they're not disturbing others (like talking on the phone or being loud), it's more about personal choice. The parents' reaction is based on their religious values, but the child's actions are a response to being forced into an activity they disagree with.\n\nSo, balancing these factors: the parents are forcing the child to attend, which is the primary issue. The child's actions are a coping mechanism, which might not be entirely their fault. However, in some contexts, even if forced, the child could be expected to at least act respectfully to avoid conflict. But since the child has communicated their lack of belief and the parents are ignoring that, it's more the parents' fault for not respecting their child's autonomy.\n\nTherefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the parents are forcing attendance without respecting the child's beliefs, and the child is dealing with it by trying to make the time pass as bearably as possible without being disruptive.\n"
