I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's break down the situation. The user is an atheist who's forced to attend church with their parents every Sunday. They brought earbuds and listened to music, also texting a friend, which made their mom upset. The parents are pushing their religious beliefs, and the kid is trying to cope by doing their own thing. \n\nFirst, the parents are forcing the child to attend a religious service they don't believe in. That seems problematic. The child has communicated their lack of belief multiple times. The parents are ignoring that and making them go. So, maybe the parents are being inconsiderate. \n\nThen, during the mass, the child uses earbuds and texts. Is that disrespectful? Well, in a church setting, people are expected to be quiet and attentive, but the child is there against their will. If they're not engaging with the service, maybe they don't feel obligated to pretend. But from the parents' perspective, the child is being rude by not participating and using a phone. \n\nThe mom called the child's behavior a \"horribly negative attitude.\" The child is just trying to endure the time. Is the child wrong for not faking interest in a religion they don't believe in? The parents are forcing them to be in an environment they don't agree with. The child's actions could be seen as a way to cope, not to be disrespectful. \n\nSo the question is whether the child is in the wrong. The parents are forcing them to attend, which is an issue. The child's response is understandable. Maybe both sides have some responsibility, but the main issue is the parents forcing attendance without respecting the child's beliefs. The child's actions, while maybe considered rude in a church context, are a reaction to being forced into a situation they're uncomfortable with. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the parents are the ones forcing the situation, and the child is trying to handle it as best as they can without causing more conflict. The parents need to respect the child's beliefs and not force participation in something the child is against.\n"
