I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation involves them being forced to attend church despite being an atheist. They use earbuds and check their phone during the service, which upset their mom.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspective of both the author and their parents. The author is an atheist and doesn't believe in the religion their parents practice. They've tried to explain this but it hasn't changed their parents' minds. The parents, on the other hand, see attending church as important and want the whole family to be involved. \n\nThe author's actions\u2014using earbuds and texting\u2014are seen as disrespectful by the mom. But the author is in a situation where they're forced to attend something they disagree with. They're using the time to do something they prefer. Is this disrespectful? Well, in a church setting, the expectation is usually for attendees to participate respectfully. Using earbuds and not paying attention might be seen as a lack of respect, especially if the family is attending together. However, the author is there unwillingly, which complicates things.\n\nThe parents are forcing the author to attend, which could be problematic. The author's right to autonomy and their religious (or lack thereof) beliefs should be considered. However, the parents might have their own reasons for wanting to attend church and might see family participation as important. \n\nBut the key point here is that the author is being forced to attend. If they don't believe, making them attend could be seen as imposing their beliefs on the author. The author's response is to disengage by using earbuds and texting. While that might be disrespectful in their parents' eyes, the root issue is the forced attendance. The author isn't wrong for trying to cope with a situation they find objectionable. \n\nHowever, there's a balance. The author's actions might be inconsiderate of their parents' feelings and the context of being in a shared family activity. Even if they are atheist, being in a church service with family might require some level of respect for the parents' wishes, even if they don't agree. \n\nBut considering the author has tried to communicate their discomfort and is still forced to attend, their actions might be a form of protest against being coerced. In that case, the fault might lie more with the parents for not respecting the author's beliefs, making the author's actions a response to that. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a grey area. On one hand, disengaging during a family event could be seen as disrespectful. On the other, being forced to attend something you don't believe in is an issue. The parents might need to reconsider their approach, but the author's reaction could be a justified protest.\n"
