I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the person is an atheist, forced to attend church by their parents, and during the mass, they wear earbuds and text a friend. The parents are upset, giving dirty looks and criticizing the person's attitude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person is being forced to attend a religious service they don't believe in. They've communicated their lack of belief multiple times. The parents are continuing to enforce this despite the person's objections. The person's actions of wearing earbuds and texting might be seen as disrespectful in a religious setting, especially if the church expects attentiveness during the mass. However, the person's perspective is that they have no choice but to attend, so they're trying to make the time pass by listening to music and texting. \n\nThe question is about whether the person is in the wrong. In many religious contexts, especially in formal settings like a church service, it's customary to show respect by being attentive and not using electronic devices. Wearing earbuds could be seen as a lack of respect to the ceremony and to the parents' beliefs. Texting during the service also reflects a lack of engagement. \n\nHowever, the person's parents are forcing them to attend, which complicates things. The person might feel they have no choice but to attend, and their actions are a way of coping or resisting. But from the parents' side, they might expect the child to participate respectfully, even if they don't believe. The parents' criticism about the attitude could stem from their desire for the child to respect their religious practices. \n\nLegally, forcing someone to attend a church isn't an issue, but socially and ethically, there's a conflict. The person's actions might be seen as disrespectful, but the root issue is the parents' enforcement of attendance despite the child's beliefs. The person isn't wrong for having a different belief, but their actions during the service might not align with social expectations in that setting, leading to conflict. \n\nSo, the answer would depend on whether respecting the parents' wishes (and the social norms of the church) takes precedence over the individual's discomfort. Since the person is being forced to attend, their actions might be a form of protest, but the manner of their protest (using earbuds and texting) could be considered disrespectful. Therefore, the person might be in the wrong for not respecting the setting they're in, even if they have valid reasons for their actions.\n"
