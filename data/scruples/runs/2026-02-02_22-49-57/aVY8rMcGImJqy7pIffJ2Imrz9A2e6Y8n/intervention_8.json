I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the author is in the wrong for wearing earbuds and checking their phone during a church mass they're forced to attend, even though they're an atheist. \n\nFirst, the situation: The parents are making the kid go to church every Sunday. The kid doesn't believe in their religion and has told them so multiple times. The kid brings earbuds to listen to music and texts a friend during mass. The mom is upset and says the kid has a negative attitude.\n\nSo, from the kid's perspective, they're being forced to attend something they don't believe in. That's a form of coercion, which is ethically problematic. The kid is trying to cope by using earbuds and texting. But from the parents' side, maybe they see attending church as important for family unity or moral reasons. They might feel the kid is being disrespectful by not paying attention.\n\nNow, considering rights and autonomy. The kid has a right to their beliefs, and the parents shouldn't force them to participate in religious activities they disagree with. But when in a public space like a church, there's an expectation of respect for the environment. So, even if the kid doesn't believe, maybe they should refrain from disruptive behavior. However, earbuds and texting aren't necessarily disruptive to others. Earbuds are personal and don't affect others, and texting is quiet unless they're talking on the phone. So maybe the kid isn't being disrespectful, just managing their time in a situation they find unpleasant.\n\nThe parents might feel disrespected, but the kid is in a bind because they're forced to be there. The kid's actions are a way to cope with being in a situation they don't want to be in. The parents' forcing attendance might be more ethically questionable than the kid's response. \n\nAlso, the kid mentioned they've told the parents they don't believe, so the parents are aware but still force them. That adds to the pressure on the kid. The kid's actions are a form of protest or self-preservation, which could be understandable.\n\nIn terms of etiquette in church, some might argue that even atheists should respect the setting. However, if the kid is there against their will, it's a conflict between the parent's wishes and the kid's autonomy. The kid isn't causing harm to others, so maybe their actions are justified. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the kid isn't necessarily in the wrong. The parents are forcing them into a situation they don't believe in, and the kid's actions are a way to cope without disrupting others. The parents might be at fault for not respecting the kid's beliefs and autonomy. Therefore, the answer would be B (No, the author is not in the wrong).\n"
