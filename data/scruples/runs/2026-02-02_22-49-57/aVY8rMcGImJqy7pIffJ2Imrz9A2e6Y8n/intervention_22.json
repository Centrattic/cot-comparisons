I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author being forced to attend a church service they don't believe in as an atheist. They're using earbuds to listen to music and texting friends during the mass, which their mom disapproves of.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is an atheist, so they don't share their parents' religious beliefs. They've communicated their lack of belief multiple times but are still forced to attend. Using earbuds and texting might be their way of coping with what they find unpleasant. From their perspective, they're not engaging in something that's against their beliefs, but they're also not respecting their parents' wishes during the event.\n\nOn the other hand, attending a religious service is often seen as a time for communal participation and respect, even if one's beliefs differ. The parents might view the author's behavior as disrespectful or dismissive of the ceremony and their family traditions. The mom's reaction could stem from the belief that the author is not showing appropriate respect in a sacred space.\n\nHowever, the author is being forced to attend an event they find meaningless. Their actions could be a form of protest or a way to preserve their own mental well-being. The question is whether their actions cross into being disrespectful or inconsiderate. Using earbuds is relatively passive and might not disrupt others, but texting could be more intrusive. Still, in a public setting where people are expected to be quiet, even texting might be seen as a breach of etiquette, regardless of the individual's beliefs.\n\nThe key points here are the conflict between the author's right to practice their own (or lack of) beliefs versus respecting the family's customs and the expectations of a public religious event. The parents are enforcing their rules, but the author is resisting in a personal way. Whether the author is in the wrong depends on the balance between respect for family norms and personal autonomy. Since the author is in a position where they're being forced to attend, their actions might be a way to assert their independence, which could be justified. However, if their actions are causing visible disrespect or annoyance, that could be seen as inconsiderate, even if they have their reasons.\n\nI think the answer leans towards B (not in the wrong) because the author is acting out of a position of being forced into a situation they don't agree with. Their actions are a coping mechanism. However, there's a gray area regarding whether texting is appropriate in such settings, which might depend on cultural norms. But overall, the parents are forcing attendance, which complicates the situation. So the author is not necessarily in the wrong.\n"
