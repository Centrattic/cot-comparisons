I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the situation is in the wrong. The person is an atheist forced to attend church by their parents, so they wear earbuds and check their phone during the service. Their mom gives them dirty looks and criticizes their attitude later.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The person is being forced to attend a religious service they don't believe in. They've communicated their lack of belief multiple times. They're using earbuds and texting as a way to cope. The parents are upset about their behavior, but the issue is the forced participation in a belief system the person doesn't adhere to.\n\nFrom a rights perspective, children have the right to their own beliefs, even if they're minors. However, parental authority in cultural or religious practices can be a point of conflict. The parents might expect respect for the tradition they're practicing, even if the child isn't participating. But the child's actions\u2014using earbuds and texting\u2014could be seen as disrespectful in that setting.\n\nHowever, the core issue here is the coercion. The parents are forcing the child to attend a service against their beliefs. The child's response is a form of passive resistance. Legally and ethically, forcing someone to participate in religious activities they don't believe in can be problematic. The parents might be in the wrong for not respecting the child's autonomy, especially after being told repeatedly.\n\nBut culturally, some might argue that showing up and being present is a sign of respect, regardless of belief. The child's actions could be seen as disrespectful in that context. However, if the child is not allowed to voice their discomfort or is forced into attendance, their coping mechanisms might be understandable.\n\nSo, weighing these factors: the parents' actions (forcing attendance) vs. the child's actions (using earbuds and texting). The parents are not respecting the child's autonomy and beliefs, which is a significant issue. The child's actions are a response to that coercion. Therefore, the author is not in the wrong because the primary fault lies with the parents for the coercion.\n"
