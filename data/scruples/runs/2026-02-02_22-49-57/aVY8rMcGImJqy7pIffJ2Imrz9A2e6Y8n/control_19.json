I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they're an atheist, forced to go to church by their parents who have recently become more religious. The person is wearing earbuds and texting during mass. Their mom gives them dirty looks and criticizes their attitude. The question is whether the author is at fault.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is being forced to attend a religious service they don't believe in. They've communicated their lack of belief multiple times, but their parents still make them go. The author's response is to use earbuds and text friends. \n\nNow, maybe the parents feel that the author is disrespectful by not engaging in the service. Church is typically a place where you're expected to participate, even if you're there against your will. But on the other hand, the parents are forcing their child to attend, which could be seen as infringing on the child's autonomy, especially since the child is an adult and an atheist. \n\nThe author's actions might be seen as rude in the context of a church service, where silence and attention are usually expected. However, if the parents are creating a situation that's uncomfortable for the child, maybe the blame isn't entirely on the child. \n\nBut then again, even if you don't believe in the religion, being respectful to others' traditions might be important. The author is in their parents' space, so maybe they should make an effort to not disrupt or be disrespectful, even if they disagree. \n\nBut the parents are forcing them to attend, which could be problematic. The parents might be expecting their child to comply without considering the child's feelings. The author's reaction could be a way of coping with an uncomfortable situation. \n\nI think the key points are: the parents are forcing attendance despite the child's protests, and the child is reacting by disengaging. Whether the child is being disrespectful or the parents are being overbearing. \n\nIn terms of social norms, church is a place where you're supposed to be quiet and attentive. So using earbuds and texting could be seen as disrespectful. But if the parents are forcing the child to attend, maybe the child's actions are a form of resistance. \n\nHowever, the child's actions might be causing discomfort to the parents, especially if they are participating in the service. The parents might feel that the child is not respecting their religious practice. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It's a bit of a balance. On one hand, the parents are forcing the child to attend, which is not ideal. On the other, the child's behavior during the service might be seen as rude. But since the parents are the ones creating the situation by forcing attendance, maybe the blame isn't entirely on the child. However, from a social etiquette standpoint, the child's actions are disrespectful. \n\nBut the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). Depending on the perspective. If we consider that the parents are at fault for forcing attendance, then the author isn't wrong. But if we look at the behavior in the church, the author is being disrespectful. \n\nI think it's a bit nuanced, but the parents are creating the problem by forcing their child to attend against their beliefs. The child's reaction is a way to cope. But in terms of the immediate situation in the church, the author's actions might be considered disrespectful. However, given the context of being forced to attend, maybe the author isn't entirely at fault. \n\nHmm. This is tricky. The parents are enforcing a practice that the child disagrees with. The child's actions are a form of protest, but they might be seen as rude. But since the parents are the ones initiating the situation, the author isn't entirely wrong. So maybe answer B, the author isn't in the wrong. But some might argue that they should be more respectful regardless. \n\nAlternatively, if the parents are inviting the child to attend, the child should at least be respectful. But if the child is being forced, maybe they can't be expected to engage. \n\nI think the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because the parents are forcing them to attend a service they don't believe in, and the author's actions are a coping mechanism. However, there's a valid argument for A if considering social etiquette. But given the context, the parents are the ones creating the issue by forcing attendance, so the author isn't entirely at fault.\n"
