I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The person is asking if they're at fault for using earbuds and texting during a church service they're forced to attend. They're an atheist, and their parents are making them go to church every Sunday. They've tried to explain that they don't believe in what the church teaches, but the parents ignore them and drag them along anyway. So the person brings earbuds and texts a friend to pass the time, but their mom gives them dirty looks and criticizes their attitude.\n\nHmm. From the person's perspective, they're being forced to attend a religious service they don't believe in. That's a form of coercion, right? They're not in a position where they can just leave, so they're trying to make the best of a bad situation. Using earbuds and texting might be their way of coping with the situation. But from the parents' side, they're probably expecting their child to participate respectfully in the service, even if they don't believe. So the parents might see the earbuds and texting as disrespectful.\n\nBut wait, the parents are the ones forcing the child to attend against their beliefs. That raises some ethical issues. The child is disrespected by being forced to attend, and then when they try to cope, the parents are upset. So maybe the parents are at fault for not respecting the child's autonomy and beliefs. On the other hand, the child could have found another way to pass the time without using earbuds or texting. But those actions aren't inherently wrong. The problem is the context of being forced to attend a service they don't believe in. \n\nI think the key here is the forced attendance. The parents are violating the child's autonomy by making them go to a place where they don't feel comfortable. The child's actions are a form of self-preservation. So the parents are in the wrong for forcing the attendance and not respecting the child's feelings. The child's actions are a reaction to that coercion. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong because they're reacting to an unfair situation. The answer should be B.\n"
