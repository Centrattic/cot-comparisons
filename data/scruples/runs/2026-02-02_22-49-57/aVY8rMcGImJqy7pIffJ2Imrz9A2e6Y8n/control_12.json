I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is that the person is an atheist forced to attend church with their parents. They're using earbuds and texting during mass, which their mom disapproves of.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is being forced to attend a religious service they don't believe in. They've communicated their lack of belief but the parents continue to make them go. The author's actions (using earbuds, texting) might be seen as disrespectful in a church setting, but they're also a form of coping with an uncomfortable situation.\n\nOn one hand, in many religious contexts, especially in churches, there's an expectation of attentiveness during the service. Using earbuds and texting could be seen as disrespectful to the environment and the family's wishes. The parents might feel that the child is being disrespectful or uncooperative.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is in a situation where their personal beliefs are being disregarded. Being forced to attend a service against one's will can create a tense environment. The author's actions might be their way of dealing with the stress or boredom, especially since they've already communicated their discomfort multiple times. The parents are continuing to force attendance despite the child's protests, which could be seen as overstepping.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. If we look at social norms, in a church setting, distracting oneself with phones or music is generally frowned upon. However, the author is in a coercive situation. The parents are forcing them to be in a place they find meaningless, which could lead to acting out as a form of resistance.\n\nBut from a moral standpoint, is it the author's fault? It's a bit of a conflict between respecting the family's wishes (and the church's norms) versus the individual's right to autonomy and expression of their beliefs. The parents are not respecting the child's autonomy by forcing them to attend, which could justify the child's actions as a form of protest. However, the actions themselves (using earbuds, texting) might still be seen as disrespectful regardless of the underlying reasons.\n\nAnother angle: the author's behavior could be seen as a way to assert their independence in a situation where they feel powerless. However, the parents are concerned about the child's attitude. The key here is whether the child's actions are considered inconsiderate or disrespectful despite the context. If the parents are trying to maintain family traditions, the child's behavior might be seen as undermining that, even if the child is being forced to participate.\n\nIn summary, there are arguments on both sides. The parents are forcing the child into a setting where they don't feel comfortable, which is problematic. The child's response, while perhaps understandable as a coping mechanism, does involve actions that could be viewed as disrespectful in that setting. However, the root issue is the parents' lack of respect for the child's autonomy, which may shift the blame more towards the parents. Therefore, the author might not be in the wrong, as their actions are a reaction to an uncomfortable and forced situation.\n"
