I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wearing earbuds and texting during church mass. The author is an atheist forced to attend by their parents. They've tried to express their lack of belief, but the parents don't listen. The author uses earbuds and texts friends during the service, which leads to their mom being upset and criticizing their attitude.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the context. The author is being forced to attend a religious service they don't believe in. That's a key point. Being forced to participate in something against one's beliefs can be stressful. They've communicated their disinterest and atheism multiple times, but the parents still make them go. So the author's actions\u2014using earbuds and texting\u2014are ways to cope with attending something they find unwanted.\n\nBut is that inconsiderate? Well, in a public setting like church, even if it's a family event, there's an expectation of respect for the environment. Wearing earbuds might be seen as disruptive if it's a family tradition and they're doing it to ignore the service. However, the author is there against their will. Maybe the parents should respect their child's feelings and not force them to attend. \n\nOn the other hand, the author could be seen as not respecting the parents' wishes and the setting. Even if they're an atheist, they might choose to be polite and not text or listen to music, especially if it's causing discomfort to their parents. The mom's reaction is also a factor\u2014she's upset, thinking the author has a negative attitude. The author might feel justified in their actions given the forced attendance, but their actions could be perceived as disrespectful.\n\nThe core issue is the conflict between the parents' insistence on religious participation and the author's atheism. The author's response is a form of passive resistance. Legally or morally, is the author wrong? It depends on cultural and familial norms. In some contexts, even if forced, maintaining respect for the setting is expected. However, the parents are also at fault for not respecting the child's beliefs and autonomy.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the parents are forcing them to attend, the author's actions might be a way to cope. But in terms of social etiquette, using earbuds and texting during a service could be seen as disrespectful regardless of personal beliefs. The parents' fault lies in not allowing the child to opt out, but the author's actions might be a reaction to that pressure.\n\nI think the answer hinges on whose perspective you take. The author isn't necessarily wrong for trying to manage their own experience in an unwanted situation. The parents are wrong for forcing attendance. The author's actions might not be the main issue; the fault is more on the parents for not respecting their child's autonomy. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
