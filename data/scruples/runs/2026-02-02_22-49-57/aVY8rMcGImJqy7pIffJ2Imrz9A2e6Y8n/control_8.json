I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. Let me break down the details.\n\nThe person is an atheist but is forced by their parents to attend church every Sunday. They brought earbuds and listened to music, also texting friends during the service. The parents are upset, giving dirty looks and criticizing their attitude. The question is whether the author is wrong.\n\nFirst, consider the context. The parents are forcing their child to attend church, even though the child doesn't believe. The parents aren't respecting the child's beliefs. The child is trying to cope with an uncomfortable situation by using earbuds and texting. That seems like a way to deal with boredom or distress, not a malicious act.\n\nFrom a religious perspective, some might say that during church services, one should be attentive and respectful. But the child isn't there by choice and has communicated their lack of belief. They're not in a place of worship, so maybe the expectations of behavior are different here.\n\nAlso, the parents are being dismissive of the child's feelings. They're forcing attendance despite the child's protests. The child's actions could be seen as a rebellion against unwanted participation, not disrespect in a place of worship. They're not in a public setting where they need to be respectful of others' beliefs, since they're in a family situation.\n\nSo, weighing it out, the parents are at fault for not respecting the child's autonomy and beliefs. The child's actions are a response to being forced into a situation they disagree with. Therefore, the author isn't in the wrong.\n"
