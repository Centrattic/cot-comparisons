I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about attending church against their will as an atheist, using earbuds and texting during the mass. The parents are forcing them to go, and the person is reacting by listening to music and texting.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person is an atheist, so they don't believe in the religion their parents are practicing. They've communicated this before, but the parents are still forcing them to attend. That seems like a problem. The act of forcing someone to attend religious services when they don't believe could be seen as infringing on their autonomy or freedom of religion. \n\nThe person is using earbuds and texting. In a church setting, especially during a mass, it's generally expected that attendees participate respectfully. Using earbuds and being on the phone might be considered disrespectful by the parents and the church community. However, the person is in a situation where they're being forced to attend, which adds complexity. They might feel that their only way to cope is to disengage by using their phone, which is understandable given the coercion.\n\nNow, considering the parents' reaction. The mother is upset about the attitude, but the person has already stated they don't believe. The parents might not be considering the child's feelings or autonomy, which could be the root of the conflict. The person's actions might be a form of protest or self-preservation against being forced into a space they find uncomfortable.\n\nSo, is the person in the wrong? Well, in terms of social etiquette in a church, they might be seen as disrespectful. But in terms of the situation, they're being forced to attend against their beliefs, which is a more fundamental issue. The parents' actions could be the main problem here. The person's response, while perhaps not ideal in the moment, is a reaction to being coerced. It's possible that both parties have valid points, but the key issue is the lack of respect for the person's beliefs and autonomy by the parents.\n\nThe question is whether the person is in the wrong. If we take into account that they are being forced to attend a place they don't believe in, their actions are a way to cope. However, in the context of the church, their behavior might be seen as disrespectful. But the core issue is the parents' insistence despite the child's clear objections. So maybe the person isn't in the wrong because they're reacting to being forced. But maybe they are in the wrong for not finding another way to cope without being disruptive.\n\nHmm. It's a bit of a balance between respecting the setting and respecting personal autonomy. The parents are forcing them, which is problematic, but the person's actions could also be seen as disrespectful in that setting. However, if they are being forced to attend, their actions might be a form of resistance. I think the answer might lean towards B, the person is not in the wrong, because the parents are forcing them into a situation they don't agree with, and the person's actions are a reaction to that coercion.\n"
