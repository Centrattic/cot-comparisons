I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're at fault for bringing earbuds and texting during church mass, which they're forced to attend. They're an atheist, so they don't believe in the religion, but their parents are forcing them to go. The parents are upset because they think the kid has a bad attitude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author is being forced to attend a religious service they don't believe in. That's a stressful situation. They're using earbuds to listen to music and texting a friend to cope. From their perspective, it's a way to pass the time and deal with being in an environment they're uncomfortable in. The parents, on the other hand, see this as disrespectful and think the child should be more accepting of the family's traditions.\n\nNow, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. Legally or morally, there's a difference. If the church has rules about phones and earbuds, maybe there's a violation. But the author is being forced to attend, which complicates things. They might feel like they have no choice but to make the best of a bad situation. However, their actions could be seen as disrespectful to the parents and the religious practice. The parents might feel that not participating in the service is a form of defiance or ingratitude. \n\nOn the other hand, the author has a right to their beliefs and to feel uncomfortable in a situation they're not in agreement with. The parents are imposing their religious practices on their child, which could be problematic. The fact that the parents are forcing attendance might be the root of the problem here. The author's actions are a response to that pressure. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? It depends on cultural and family expectations. In many cultures, attending religious services with family is considered a shared experience, and not participating fully might be seen as rude. But the author is also in a position where they're not allowed to opt out, which is a form of coercion. If the parents are genuinely trying to include the child in their spiritual life, the child's resistance might be seen as natural given the lack of belief. However, if the parents expect respect for their practices, the child's actions could be viewed as disrespectful. \n\nI think the key here is the parents' role in forcing attendance. If the family is making the child attend, the parents might be at fault for not respecting the child's autonomy. The child's actions are a reaction to that. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but they might need to find a different way to handle the situation, like having an open conversation with the parents or finding a compromise. The answer would lean towards B, the author is not in the wrong, because the parents are forcing them into a situation where they can't authentically participate or express their discomfort without repercussions. The child's actions are a response to being forced into a practice they don't believe in.\n"
