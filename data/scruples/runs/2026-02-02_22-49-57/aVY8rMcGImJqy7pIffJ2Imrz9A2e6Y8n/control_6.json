I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about attending church against their will as an atheist and using earbuds and texting during the service.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person is forced to attend church by their parents despite not believing in the religion. They're an atheist, so attending church isn't their choice. The parents are making them go every Sunday. The person is using earbuds and texting to cope with the situation. \n\nThe parents' reaction is that they're upset about the behavior, calling it a negative attitude. The question is whether the author is wrong for doing this. \n\nFrom a religious standpoint, being disruptive in a church service might be seen as disrespectful, even if the person doesn't believe. However, the key point here is that the person is being forced to attend against their will. If the parents are making them go, the person might feel they have no choice but to find ways to cope, like using earbuds or texting. \n\nBut is there a right or wrong in this? It's important to consider both sides. The parents might feel that attending church is a family tradition or a moral obligation, and they might expect respect for the setting. The child, on the other hand, is in an environment where they don't believe and are being forced to participate, which could be stressful. \n\nIn some cultures or families, being present in a religious ceremony without participating might be expected, even if you don't believe. However, using earbuds and texting could be seen as disrespectful in that setting. But if the person is being forced to attend, the lack of participation might be unavoidable. \n\nThe parents might be at fault for forcing their child to attend a place of worship when the child doesn't believe, which could lead to resentment. The child's actions might be a response to that pressure. \n\nBut from a strict etiquette perspective, being physically present in a church but not engaging (like using earbuds) could be seen as impolite or disrespectful to the people around them. However, if the person is not participating in the service and isn't causing a disturbance, maybe it's a personal choice. \n\nThe main conflict here is between the parents' wishes and the child's autonomy and beliefs. The parents are forcing attendance, which is problematic, and the child is reacting by disengaging. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the key issue is the use of earbuds and texting, it's possible that the parents are also at fault for forcing the child into a situation they find objectionable. The child's behavior might be a form of protest. However, in terms of social norms within the church setting, using earbuds and texting might still be seen as disrespectful regardless of the circumstances. \n\nBut given that the parents are forcing the child to attend, the child's actions could be a way to cope, which might not be entirely their fault. The parents' insistence on forcing attendance without respecting the child's beliefs is a significant factor here. \n\nI think the answer leans towards the author not being in the wrong. The parents are forcing them to attend, which is the root issue. The child's actions are a response to that pressure. However, there's a cultural aspect where even if you're forced to attend, being disruptive is frowned upon. \n\nBut considering the parent's actions in forcing attendance against the child's beliefs, the blame might lie more with the parents. The author's behavior is a consequence of that pressure. So the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong.\n"
