I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is that the author is an atheist forced to attend church with their parents, and they're wearing earbuds and texting during the service. The parents are upset, giving dirty looks and criticizing the author's attitude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is being forced to attend a church service they don't believe in. They've communicated their atheism to their parents, but the parents keep forcing them to go. The author is using earbuds and texting as a way to cope with the situation. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? Well, in a religious setting, there are usually expected behaviors like showing respect, not using phones, and being attentive. The author is not participating in the service and is using devices, which could be seen as disrespectful. However, the author is there against their will and has no belief in the religion. The parents might be enforcing their religious practices, but the author's actions are a form of protest against being forced into something they disagree with.\n\nBut then again, even if the author is forced to attend, maybe there's an expectation to at least act respectfully during the service. The parents might be trying to instill religious values, but the author's behavior could be seen as dismissive. However, the parents are also forcing the author to attend, which might infringe on the author's autonomy, especially if they're of age.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, it's a bit of a gray area. The author's actions could be considered disrespectful in the context of the church, but the parents are also forcing them into a situation they don't believe in. The parents' reaction might be about respect versus the author's right to not participate. \n\nSo, maybe the answer is B (No, the author is not in the wrong) because they are being forced to attend something they don't believe in and are trying to cope in a way that's respectful to their own beliefs. However, others might argue that they should still act respectfully in the setting. It's a balance between personal autonomy and respect for others' religious spaces. Since the author is there under duress and has communicated their beliefs, it's more about the parents' approach being the issue rather than the author's actions.\n"
