I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for wearing earbuds and texting during church, even though they're an atheist and forced to attend by their parents.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is an atheist, which means they don't believe in the religion their parents are practicing. They've told their parents multiple times about their lack of belief, but the parents still force them to attend. That seems like a key point. Being forced to attend a religious service you don't believe in could be seen as a form of pressure or coercion, which might not be healthy, especially for a child.\n\nThen, during the mass, the author uses earbuds to listen to music and texts friends. The parents react with dirty looks and criticism about their attitude. The author feels they're being unfairly judged. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. \n\nFrom a religious perspective, some might argue that being distracted or using electronic devices during a sacred service is disrespectful. But the author isn't there by choice; they're being forced. So their actions could be seen as a form of protest or coping mechanism against something they find meaningless and forced. \n\nHowever, even if forced to attend, the act of using earbuds and texting could be seen as disrespectful in the eyes of their parents or the church community. But the parents are the ones forcing attendance, so maybe the real issue is their approach. The author is reacting to their parents' insistence with disengagement, which might be a way to maintain their autonomy.\n\nIt's a conflict between parental expectations and the child's autonomy. The parents want participation in their beliefs, but the child resists, leading to conflict. The author's actions might be seen as justified if they're trying to cope with an uncomfortable situation they didn't choose. \n\nBut maybe there's a middle ground. The author could have discussed their discomfort more before the event, or the parents could respect the child's autonomy. However, given the circumstances, the author isn't necessarily wrong for trying to make the best of a forced situation. They're not causing harm beyond their own disengagement, which might be their way of handling the situation without outright confrontation. \n\nSo, considering all this, the answer leans towards B (the author is not in the wrong), because they're in a situation forced upon them and their actions are a form of coping within that context.\n"
