I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong for wearing earbuds and texting during a church mass they're forced to attend. The author is an atheist, and their parents have recently started attending church, dragging them along despite their protests. The parents are upset about the behavior during mass.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is being forced to attend something they don't believe in. That's a key point. Being forced to participate in religious activities you don't agree with can be stressful. They mention they've told their parents multiple times they don't believe, but the parents ignore that. So the author's actions might be a form of resistance or coping mechanism.\n\nNow, wearing earbuds and listening to music. In many churches, especially traditional ones, silence and attention during mass are expected. Distractions like music could be seen as disrespectful. But the author is there against their will, so maybe their perspective is different. They might feel that using earbuds is a way to make the time more bearable. However, from the parents' viewpoint, this could look dismissive of the practice they value.\n\nTexting a friend every 15 minutes adds another layer. That's more active than just listening to music; it's engaging in another conversation. This could be perceived as even more disrespectful. The parents might see this as a sign of disrespect towards their religious practice and towards the church environment.\n\nBut considering the author's position, they are in an uncomfortable situation. The parents are enforcing their religious practices on a child who doesn't share the beliefs. The author's actions could be a form of asserting their autonomy. However, in a public setting like church, there's an expectation of certain behavior, regardless of personal beliefs. The conflict here is between the author's right to autonomy and the parents' desire for respectful participation in their religious practice.\n\nLegally, there's no law against wearing earbuds in church, but socially, it's a matter of norms and family dynamics. The parents might feel that the author is not respecting their wishes or the sanctity of the church. The author might feel that they are being forced into a situation they don't agree with and are trying to make the best of it.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, it's complicated. If the author is being respectful in their own way (like not causing a disturbance), maybe they're not in the wrong. But if their actions are seen as disruptive or disrespectful in the context of the church, then they might be. However, since the author is there under pressure and has communicated their lack of belief, their actions could be a form of passive resistance rather than willful disrespect.\n\nSo, considering all angles, the answer would be B (No), the author isn't in the wrong because they're in a situation they don't agree with and are trying to manage their time there as best as they can. The parents might be at fault for forcing attendance and not respecting the child's autonomy.\n"
