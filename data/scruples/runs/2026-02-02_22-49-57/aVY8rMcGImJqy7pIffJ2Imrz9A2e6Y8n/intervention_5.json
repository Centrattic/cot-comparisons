I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the situation is in the wrong. They\u2019re an atheist being forced to attend church with their parents, so they brought earbuds and occasionally checked their phone. Their mom gave them dirty looks and said they have a negative attitude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is being forced to attend a religious service they don't believe in. They've communicated their lack of belief multiple times, but the parents still insist. The author's actions are about coping with the situation by using earbuds and texting. \n\nNow, thinking about whether that's wrong. In a public religious setting, like a church mass, there are usually expectations for respectful behavior. Wearing earbuds might be seen as disengaged or disrespectful, especially during parts of the service that are considered important. Texting could be even more problematic, as it's a distraction and might be viewed as a lack of respect for the event or others present.\n\nBut the author's parents are forcing them to attend, which complicates things. The parents might believe they're enforcing family unity or tradition, which can be a valid cultural or familial expectation. However, the child is an adult who has expressed their views, so is it wrong to still force them? If the parents are insistent despite the child's objections, that might be where the parents are at fault. \n\nReligious institutions often emphasize respect for the service, regardless of one's personal beliefs. The act of bringing in earbuds and using a phone could be seen as disrupting the intended experience. But the child is in a difficult position, having to attend a service they disagree with. Their actions might be a form of protest or coping, which could be understandable. \n\nOn the other hand, the parents might feel hurt or think the child is being disrespectful, even if the child is just disinterested. The mom's reaction is about the child's attitude, which might be more about emotional hurt rather than a strict religious rule. \n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? If the parents are forcing them to attend against their will, maybe the parents are at fault. But the specific actions of using earbuds and texting in a church setting could be considered disrespectful. The answer might depend on cultural norms and how the family views this. But since the parents are aware the child is an atheist and still force attendance, perhaps the child's actions are justified as a way to deal with an uncomfortable situation. However, public displays of disengagement might still be seen as wrong by others in the church. \n\nHmm, maybe the answer is that the author isn't in the wrong because they're being forced to attend a service they don't believe in. They're handling their discomfort by using earbuds and texting, which might be their way of coping. The parents are possibly at fault for not respecting the child's beliefs. But some might argue that even in a forced situation, showing respect for the environment is important. It's a bit of a dilemma, but I think the key point is that the parents are the ones forcing attendance without considering the child's well-being. So the answer is B.\n"
