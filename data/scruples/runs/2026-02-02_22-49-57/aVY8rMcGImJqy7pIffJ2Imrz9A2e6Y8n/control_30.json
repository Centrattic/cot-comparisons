I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for wearing earbuds and checking their phone during church mass when forced to attend by their parents, despite being an atheist.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation. The author is an atheist but forced to go to church by their parents. They've communicated their lack of belief, but the parents still make them go. The author then uses earbuds and texts a friend during mass. The parents are upset, saying the author has a negative attitude.\n\nNow, the key points here are the forced attendance and the author's response. Legally, parents can't force a child to attend church, but maybe in this context, they have some authority. However, the author is an atheist, so their participation is not genuine. Wearing earbuds and texting could be seen as disrespectful in a religious setting, especially if the family values going to church. But the parents are forcing attendance, which might be the core issue here.\n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. From a religious standpoint, using earbuds and texting during mass is disrespectful. But from the author's perspective, they're being forced to attend a place they don't believe in, so their actions might be a form of protest or coping. The parents might be at fault for forcing attendance, leading to the author's behavior. \n\nHowever, the author's actions could still be considered disrespectful regardless of the circumstances, which might make them wrong. On the other hand, if the parents are unreasonable, the author's actions are a reaction to that. So it's a bit of a toss-up. But in terms of social norms, attending a religious event and not participating respectfully is often frowned upon, even if you're an atheist. The author might be wrong for not adhering to the social expectations of the environment they're in, even if they don't agree with the beliefs. So maybe answer A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
