I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author attending a church mass against their will, being an atheist, and using earbuds and texting during the service. The parents are forcing them to attend, and the author is getting criticized for their behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author is forced to attend church by their parents despite not believing in the religion. They're using earbuds to listen to music and texting friends to cope with being there. The parents are upset, calling the author negative and not appreciative.\n\nFrom a religious perspective, attending church and participating respectfully is expected. Using earbuds might be seen as disrespectful because it's a place of worship where one is supposed to listen and participate. Texting during the service could also be viewed as disruptive or disrespectful. However, the author is forced to attend, which complicates things. They might not feel they have a choice, which could explain their coping mechanisms.\n\nBut the key point is whether the author is in the wrong. If the parents are forcing them to attend, the author's actions might be a way to deal with the forced attendance. However, in a religious setting, there's an expectation of respect regardless of personal beliefs. Wearing earbuds and texting could be seen as disrespectful to the institution and the parents' beliefs. The parents might feel that the author is showing contempt for their practices, which could cause family tension.\n\nOn the other hand, the author is being honest about their beliefs and is not pretending to participate. They're not causing a disturbance beyond their own actions. The parents are the ones enforcing attendance, which might be the root of the problem. The author's actions could be a form of passive resistance to being forced into a practice they don't believe in.\n\nBut in terms of social etiquette, even if you don't agree with the setting, showing respect is usually expected. The author's actions might be seen as a lack of respect. However, if they're being coerced, there's a different dynamic. The parents might need to reconsider the forced attendance, but the author's behavior in the church setting could still be problematic from the parents' religious standpoint.\n\nSo, balancing both perspectives: the author's actions are disrespectful in a religious context, but the parents are forcing attendance. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the author is in a space where respect is expected, their actions might be considered disrespectful regardless of their personal beliefs. However, if the parents are the ones forcing attendance without considering the author's views, the parents have some fault too. But the question is specifically about the author's wrongdoing. The answer might be that the author is in the wrong because of their disrespectful behavior in the church, even if the situation is problematic. Alternatively, considering the coercion, maybe not. But generally, in such a setting, the expectation is to behave respectfully, so the author is in the wrong.\n"
