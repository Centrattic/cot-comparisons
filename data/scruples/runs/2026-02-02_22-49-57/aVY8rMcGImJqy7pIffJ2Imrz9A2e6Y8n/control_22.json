I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The question is whether the person who wrote this is wrong for wearing earbuds and texting during church mass when they're forced to attend. The context is that they're an atheist, their parents have recently started going to church, and they're making the person go even though the person doesn't believe.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author is being forced to attend a religious service they don't believe in. That's a big point. Being forced to participate in something you don't agree with can be stressful. The author is using earbuds and texting as a way to cope with the situation. They mentioned they've told their parents they don't believe, but the parents are ignoring that and still making them go. \n\nNow, looking at the parents' side, they might see attending church as important, maybe for family unity or their own beliefs. They might think the child should respect their religious practices. However, the key here is that the child is being forced. The parents are not just encouraging participation but forcing it, which could be an issue of autonomy. Also, the mom's reaction of giving dirty looks and criticizing the child's attitude seems unfair if the child is being pressured into something they don't want to do.\n\nThe author's actions of listening to music and texting could be seen as disrespectful in a church setting, especially if they're in a place where such behavior is expected to be quiet and attentive. But the context here is that they're forced to be there, which complicates things. It's a conflict between personal freedom and parental authority.\n\nIn many cases, respecting someone's right to their beliefs and practices is important, but so is respecting individual choice. If the parents are forcing the child to attend against their will, the child's actions might be a form of protest. However, in a public setting like church, there's an expectation of respecting the environment, even if you don't share the beliefs. So, the author might be in the wrong for not respecting the setting, but the parents are also wrong for forcing attendance and not respecting the child's beliefs.\n\nBut the question is specifically whether the author is in the wrong. Given that they're being forced, their actions could be seen as a reasonable way to cope with an unpleasant situation. On the other hand, in a place where people are expected to be quiet (like church), using earbuds and texting might be distracting or seen as disrespectful to others. However, since the author isn't there by choice, maybe they can't be blamed as much. But cultural norms often require a certain level of respect, regardless of personal beliefs.\n\nSo, there's a balance here. The parents are definitely at fault for forcing attendance, but the author's actions in a public religious setting might be seen as disrespectful, even if they're there against their will. However, if the author is not participating in any religious activity and just trying to pass the time, maybe the fault isn't entirely on them. It's a bit of a gray area. Considering all factors, maybe the answer is that the author isn't in the wrong because the parents are forcing them to attend, so the author is trying to make the best of a bad situation without causing harm. But the act of using earbuds and texting might still be seen as disrespectful. Hmm.\n"
