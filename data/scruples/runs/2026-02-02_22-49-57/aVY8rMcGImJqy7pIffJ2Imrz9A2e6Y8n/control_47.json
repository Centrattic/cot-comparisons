I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about attending a church mass they don't believe in and using earbuds and texting during it.\n\nFirst, the person is an atheist but forced to attend church by their parents. They explain they've told their parents they don't believe, but the parents ignore them. The person uses earbuds to listen to music and texts a friend. The mom is upset, calling them negative.\n\nNow, should the author be in the wrong? Well, the parents are forcing them to attend, which might be an issue. The parents aren't respecting the child's beliefs. The author is trying to cope with an uncomfortable situation by using earbuds and texting. Is that disrespectful? In a public setting like church, especially if they're attending, maybe they should try to be respectful. But if they're not part of the faith and it's forced, their actions might be seen as a way to deal with the situation. The parents might expect them to act respectfully even if they don't believe. But the parents are also forcing them to attend, which could be the root of the problem. \n\nThe question is about who's more at fault. The author's actions are a response to being forced to attend. So maybe the parents are more at fault for not respecting the child's beliefs. The author might not be in the wrong for trying to cope. However, if the church has rules about such behavior, the author might be in the wrong regardless. But the scenario doesn't mention specific rules. The key is the parents forcing attendance and the author's reaction. So the answer might be B, the author isn't in the wrong because the parents are forcing them into a situation they're uncomfortable with.\n"
