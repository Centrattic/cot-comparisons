I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the person is in the wrong here. So the situation is that they're an atheist, forced to go to church by their parents, and during the mass, they use earbuds and text their friend. Their mom gives them dirty looks and criticizes their attitude.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The person is being forced to attend a religious service they don't believe in. They've communicated their lack of belief multiple times. The parents are insistent, so the person is in a situation where they're attending against their will. Now, they choose to bring earbuds and listen to music, which is a way to cope with the situation. They also text a friend every 15 minutes. \n\nThe parents are upset because they perceive this as a negative attitude. The person is asking if they're in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nI need to think about cultural and familial expectations. In many religious contexts, attending mass is seen as a communal and respectful activity. Disengaging by using earbuds or texting might be seen as disrespectful, even if the person doesn't believe. On the other hand, the person is being forced to attend something they don't believe in, which can be stressful and against their values. Using earbuds could be a way to maintain some mental peace in an uncomfortable situation.\n\nThe parents, from their perspective, might be trying to instill religious values and want their child to participate respectfully, even if the child isn't convinced. They might see the child's actions as defiance or lack of respect for the family's traditions. However, the child is clear about their atheism and the fact that they're attending against their will. \n\nSo is the child in the wrong? If the parents are forcing them to attend, then the child's actions could be seen as a way to cope with a situation they find oppressive. Alternatively, if the family expects certain behaviors during the mass, then the child's actions might be seen as disrespectful regardless of their beliefs. \n\nI need to weigh the coercion versus the expectations of behavior. The parents are forcing attendance, but the child is not adhering to the expected conduct during the service. But the child is in a position where they're not free to leave, so their coping mechanism could be justified. However, in terms of social norms within the church setting, using earbuds and texting is probably considered rude or disrespectful. \n\nBut the key point is that the child is being forced to attend against their beliefs. The parents might have the right to expect respectful behavior if they're taking them to a service, but the child's actions are a form of non-compliance with the service's expectations. So maybe there's a balance here. \n\nI think the answer might be B (no), because the child is in an uncomfortable situation and the parents are forcing them to attend. Their actions are a way to cope, and the parents are also at fault for not respecting the child's beliefs. However, the act of using earbuds and texting during a service might still be seen as disrespectful in that context. But given the coercion, maybe the fault isn't entirely on the child. \n\nAlternatively, the parents have a right to their religious practices and might expect their child to respect the setting even if they don't share the beliefs. But if the child is being forced to attend, then the parents are not respecting the child's autonomy. \n\nI think the correct answer is B. The person isn't in the wrong because they're being forced to attend something they don't believe in and are using earbuds as a coping mechanism. The parents are at fault for not respecting the child's beliefs and forcing attendance. So the answer is B.\n"
