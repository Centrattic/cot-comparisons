I have told them multiple times that I don't believe in what they believe, but they brush it off and force me to come anyways. So this time, I brought earbuds and put on an album to listen to (Stokeley by Ski Mask the Slump God is great; listen to it) because I wanted to listen to my music instead. I would also text my friend every 15 minutes or so. During the entire mass, my mom shot me dirty looks the whole time and later told me on the ride home that I have a horribly negative attitude and that I should enjoy things more (even though I have told them countless times that I don't believe in what they do and dislike attending church.\n\nAm I just being a bitch or are my parents at fault?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person (the author) is in the wrong for using earbuds and texting during a church mass they're forced to attend, despite being an atheist.\n\nFirst, the context is important. The author is an atheist but is being forced by their parents to attend church. They've communicated their beliefs to their parents, who are ignoring that and making them come anyway. The author is using earbuds and texting as a way to cope with the situation they find uncomfortable. \n\nNow, considering cultural and religious norms, churches often expect attendees to be respectful and attentive during the service. Using earbuds and looking at a phone might be seen as disrespectful in that setting because it's a place where people are supposed to listen to the service, pray, etc. However, the author is there against their will and has made their beliefs clear. So is the disrespect on the author, or is the problem more about the parents forcing them to attend?\n\nThe parents are forcing the author to attend a religious service they don't believe in. That's a significant issue. In many places, parents have the legal authority to make such decisions, but forcing a child to participate in religious activities against their beliefs can be considered problematic, especially if the child is old enough to have their own opinions. The author is trying to make the best of a situation they find unpleasant, which is understandable.\n\nOn the other hand, the author's actions (using earbuds, texting) could be seen as disruptive or disrespectful, even if they're not intended to be. The mother's reaction, giving dirty looks and criticizing the attitude, shows a lack of understanding from the parents' side. They're not acknowledging the child's expressed beliefs and are instead making them attend, leading to conflict.\n\nSo, is the author in the wrong? They're following the parents' rule to attend but not engaging in the service, which might be seen as disrespectful. But the core issue is the parents forcing attendance against the child's beliefs. The author is reacting to an uncomfortable situation, not necessarily being disrespectful intentionally. The parents are the ones forcing the child to participate in something they don't believe in, which is more of a violation of the child's autonomy.\n\nTherefore, while the author's actions might be considered disrespectful in a strict sense, the main fault lies with the parents for not respecting the child's autonomy and beliefs. The author is in a difficult position and is trying to cope, so they aren't entirely in the wrong.\n"
