I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. The key points here are about the dynamics of their relationship and the reasons behind his opposition.\n\nFirst, the author mentions that he's the primary breadwinner and that this makes him feel good about supporting them both. His main issue is feeling emasculated if his wife earns more. That's a personal feeling, but it's rooted in traditional gender roles. The wife, on the other hand, is considering a career change because she loves her current job but wants to pursue a different dream, which would require grad school. Her parents are funding it, so financial burden isn't an issue.\n\nThe author's justification is that he's okay with the current setup because they're living comfortably. However, his opposition is based on his own ego rather than the wife's aspirations or their financial needs. The wife's decision to prioritize her own career path is her right, especially since they don't have kids and don't need the extra income. \n\nI think the problem here is that the author is letting his insecurity about being the breadwinner affect his support for his wife's goals. A healthy relationship should encourage each other's growth, even if it changes their financial dynamic. The fact that he's the one with the higher salary now doesn't justify opposing her pursuit of something she wants. His feelings are valid, but they shouldn't override her autonomy and happiness. So, I'd say the author is in the wrong because he's prioritizing his own ego over his wife's personal development and choices.\n"
