I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong. The question is about whether it's okay for the husband not to want his wife to pursue a higher-paying career.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The husband is making enough for both of them to live comfortably. The wife currently makes less, and he's okay with that. But now, her parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which would let her earn more than him. He's not happy about that because it would mean he's not the sole breadwinner anymore, which makes him feel emasculated.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about his feelings of being the breadwinner and feeling good about supporting the family. But is it fair for him to use that as a reason to discourage her from pursuing her goals? The wife seems to have a dream she wants to pursue, and she's excited about it. She already put her education on hold before to work and support them. Now, she's considering it again. Her parents' offer is a financial incentive, so it's not like she's taking on a huge financial burden.\n\nThe husband's main concern is his self-esteem tied to being the higher earner. But should he let his ego dictate his wife's career choices? That could be problematic. In a healthy relationship, supporting each other's goals is important. If he's not happy unless he's making more, maybe that's a personal issue he needs to address. Also, the wife might want to grow professionally, and he's hindering that because of his own insecurities.\n\nAnother angle: they don't have kids, so maybe the need for dual income isn't there. But that's different from her pursuing her own path. The husband's reasoning is based on his feelings of masculinity being tied to financial dominance. That's a traditional view that's increasingly being challenged. It's possible he's in the wrong because he's prioritizing his ego over his wife's aspirations.\n\nWait, but he did express concerns about the different career path and her current job. Maybe he's also worried about her changing careers, which could be a valid practical concern. However, he admitted the real reason is his feelings about being the breadwinner. So even if the practical concerns are there, the emotional reason is more about his own insecurities. That seems like the crux of the issue.\n\nSo the answer would be AITA? The author is in the wrong because his reasoning is based on his ego rather than his wife's happiness and growth. He should support her decision to pursue her dreams, even if it changes their financial dynamic. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
