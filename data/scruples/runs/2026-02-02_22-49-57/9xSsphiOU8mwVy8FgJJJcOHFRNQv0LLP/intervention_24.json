I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a higher-paying career. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to consider multiple angles.\n\nFirst, the author acknowledges that his wife could earn more than him, and he's not comfortable with that. The reason he gives is feeling emasculated if he's not the higher earner. That's a personal feeling, but it's important to note that in a relationship, both partners should have autonomy over their careers. The wife has a right to pursue her dreams or further education, especially since the financial stability is already there. They don't need the extra income, so her choice isn't about financial necessity but personal fulfillment.\n\nAnother point is that the wife's parents are offering to cover all her educational expenses. That removes the financial burden on them, so it's not about money. The author's concern seems to stem from his own ego or societal expectations about being the breadwinner. However, modern relationships often prioritize mutual respect and support for each other's goals over traditional gender roles. \n\nThe author also mentions that his wife had put her grad school plans on hold earlier, which might mean she's been considering this for a while. His hesitation could be seen as undermining her autonomy and not respecting her personal aspirations. Even if the author feels uncomfortable, it's her decision to make, and he should support her choice if it's her dream. \n\nThe fact that they don't plan to have kids removes another common reason for dual incomes. So, the author's main issue is his own feelings about being the primary earner. While it's valid that he feels this way, it's not a justification for controlling his wife's career choices. Healthy relationships require supporting each other's growth, even if it leads to personal discomfort.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's feelings are personal, but the key is whether he respects his wife's autonomy. Since the wife is making a choice that's not harmful to the relationship and is supported by her family, the author should support her. Therefore, he's in the wrong for not wanting her to pursue her dream based on his own insecurities.\n"
