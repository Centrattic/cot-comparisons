I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong. The situation involves a husband who doesn't want his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The husband makes enough to support both of them, and they don't plan to have kids. The wife is offered a free grad program by her wealthy parents. The husband's main issue is feeling emasculated if he makes less. He's not against her career per se, but the fact that it would make him the lower earner.\n\nI should look at the key points. The husband's reasoning is based on his own insecurities rather than the wife's best interests. The wife wants to follow her dream, even though she loves her current job. The husband's opposition is emotional (feeling good as a provider) rather than practical (financial need). \n\nThe question is whether this makes him in the wrong. Societal norms often emphasize equality in relationships, and traditional gender roles might view the husband's feelings as outdated. However, personal feelings of insecurity are real. But the husband is using his emotions as a reason to potentially block his wife's aspirations.\n\nAlso, the wife's parents are supportive, which adds another layer. The husband's hesitation might also be about the change in their dynamic. But is it fair for him to prioritize his ego over her goals? The wife's happiness and career growth are her own rights, regardless of earnings. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the husband's stance is based on personal feelings rather than objective reasons. It's possible he's not in the wrong if we consider that people have different emotional needs, but in a healthy relationship, supporting each other's growth is key. So, his not wanting to support her choice because of his own insecurities might be seen as wrong. \n\nThe answer likely leans towards A (the author is in the wrong) because the husband is prioritizing his ego over his wife's aspirations without valid practical reasons. But maybe some might argue B if they consider personal feelings valid. However, the question is more about the rightness of his position, and the husband's reasoning is selfish in the context of a marriage where there's no financial necessity. So the answer is A.\n"
