I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. The situation involves his wife possibly going back to grad school, supported by her parents, which could lead to a higher salary than his current one.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author mentions that he's the primary breadwinner and that he feels emasculated if he makes less. He supports his wife's current job, which she loves, but is hesitant about her changing careers for a higher-paying one. The main issue seems to be his feelings of self-worth tied to being the higher earner.\n\nFrom a traditional standpoint, some might argue that supporting a partner's career growth is important, regardless of salary. However, the author is upfront about his feelings and isn't forcing her; he's expressing concern but allowing her to make her own choice. He's not actively preventing her from pursuing the opportunity, just sharing his perspective.\n\nThere's also the aspect of financial independence. The couple can live comfortably on his salary alone, so the need for her higher earnings might not be financial but personal. The wife's parents are offering to cover education costs, which reduces the financial burden on the couple.\n\nHowever, the author's reasoning is based on personal ego\u2014valuing his role as the breadwinner. This could be seen as outdated or selfish, as it prioritizes his self-esteem over his wife's career aspirations. In a modern context, equality in a partnership often involves mutual support regardless of income levels.\n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's not blocking her but expressing his feelings, it's more about his personal discomfort than actively harming her opportunities. However, the underlying issue is whether his feelings are valid. Some might argue that his feelings are his own, but others might see it as a problematic mindset that could affect the relationship dynamics.\n\nIn terms of the AITA aspect, the key is whether he's wronged her by not supporting her choice. Since he's not stopping her and is being honest, maybe he's not in the wrong. But the fact that his reasoning is based on ego rather than practical concerns could make some people think he is in the wrong. The answer might depend on cultural or personal values regarding gender roles and partnership.\n"
