I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the \"Am I the Asshole?\" scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author opposing his wife's potential career move that could make her earn more than him. \n\nFirst, I need to assess the key points. The author's main issue is feeling emasculated if his wife earns more. He acknowledges that his wife previously put her education on hold to support their finances, and now her parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which could change their income dynamics. The wife is excited about this opportunity, even though it's a different career path.\n\nSo, the core of the problem is the author's personal feelings about being the primary breadwinner. He admits this is a reason for his resistance. Now, whether he's in the wrong depends on societal norms and ethical considerations. From a modern perspective, prioritizing personal ego over a partner's aspirations and opportunities is often seen as problematic. Supporting each other's career growth, especially when it's feasible (since their finances are stable), is generally encouraged in healthy relationships.\n\nThe wife's parents funding her education removes the financial burden, making it a more about her personal goals. The author's concern about feeling emasculated is valid for him, but it shouldn't override her desires. Healthy relationships require mutual support and communication. The author's hesitation might stem from insecurity, which is a personal issue he needs to address rather than a justifiable reason to discourage his wife.\n\nAlso, the fact that they don't plan to have kids means there's no financial necessity to increase their combined income. The wife's decision to pursue her dream, despite the salary change, is about her fulfillment. The author's stance could hinder her personal growth and might create resentment. Therefore, it's likely the author is in the wrong because he's prioritizing his ego over her aspirations, and the situation allows for her pursuit without financial strain.\n"
