I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the main issue is that the husband doesn't want his wife to go to grad school to earn more than him. The wife's parents are offering to cover all the costs, which removes the financial burden. The husband's reasoning is that he feels it would make him feel emasculated if his wife's salary surpasses his. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The couple is doing well financially on the husband's salary alone, and they don't plan to have kids. So there's no immediate financial need for the wife to earn more. But the wife wants to pursue a career path she's interested in, even though it's different from her current job. The husband's objection is based on his own feelings about being the breadwinner, not on practical concerns like their financial stability.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, it's important that both partners in a relationship should support each other's personal and professional growth. The husband's resistance seems to stem from his ego rather than any practical issues. Even though he's not against her education, his main concern is his own self-esteem. That feels like a selfish reason because his wife's happiness and aspirations should matter more than his feelings about being the higher earner.\n\nAlso, the wife already made a sacrifice by putting her grad school plans on hold to support the couple financially when he was in school. It seems unfair for him to now discourage her from pursuing her own goals just because it might affect his ego. The parents covering the costs removes the financial argument against her going to school, so the only real objection is based on his feelings.\n\nIn a healthy relationship, partners should encourage each other to reach their full potential. The husband's reluctance to let his wife take this step could be seen as holding her back. Even if he's uncomfortable with the idea of her earning more, that's something he needs to work on personally rather than imposing on her choices. So, I think the author is in the wrong because his feelings shouldn't override his wife's aspirations, especially when there's no financial need and the support from her parents is available.\n"
