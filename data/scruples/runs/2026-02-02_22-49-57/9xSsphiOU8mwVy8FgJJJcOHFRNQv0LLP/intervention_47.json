I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. \n\nFirst, the author's main issue is feeling emasculated if his wife earns more. He mentions that he's the breadwinner and that makes him feel good. His wife is considering going back to grad school, which would lead to a higher salary, even though they don't need the money. The key points here are his emotional response based on traditional gender roles and the financial situation.\n\nNow, considering the wife's perspective. She previously put her grad school plans on hold to work full-time during his master's. Now, with her parents' support, she's excited to pursue her dream. The author's opposition seems rooted in his own ego rather than her aspirations. He acknowledges that she loves her current job but she wants to follow a different path. \n\nThe question is whether the author is wrong. From a modern standpoint, supporting a partner's career goals is often encouraged, regardless of income comparison. The author's hesitation is based on personal feelings about status, not practical concerns like financial necessity. However, the situation isn't entirely cut-and-dry because they can live comfortably on his salary, so there's no financial pressure. The wife's desire for personal growth and career advancement is valid. \n\nThe author might not be in the wrong if he's honest about his feelings and they're on the same page. But if he's suppressing her ambitions because of traditional views, that's problematic. The response should consider both emotional validity and the potential harm of not supporting her goals. \n\nIn terms of advice, it's about communication and mutual respect. The author's feelings are valid, but they shouldn't override his wife's aspirations. So, the answer would likely lean towards the author being in the wrong (A) because his reasoning is based on ego rather than supporting his wife's happiness and growth.\n"
