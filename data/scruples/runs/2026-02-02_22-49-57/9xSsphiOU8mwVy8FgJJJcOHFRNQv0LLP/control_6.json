I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the man is making a good salary and is the sole breadwinner. His wife works but earns less than half of what he does. They don't plan to have kids, so they don't need more income. The wife had put her grad school plans aside when he was in school, and now her parents are offering to pay for it. She wants to go back to a different field that could make her earn more than him. The man is against it because he feels emasculated if she makes more. That's the core issue.\n\nHmm. The question is whether he's wrong for feeling that way. The wife wants to pursue her dream, which he acknowledges she loves. But his main reason is about his ego. That seems a bit selfish. Society is moving towards more equality, and supporting each other's career growth is usually encouraged. Also, the fact that her parents are paying reduces the financial burden on the couple, so it's not like she's taking money out of their joint budget. \n\nHe mentioned they don't need the money, so the practical reasons are out. The main conflict is his emotional response. It's his personal feeling, but is it wrong to prioritize his feelings over her career choice? Well, in a healthy relationship, both partners should support each other's goals. If he's not supporting her because of his ego, that's a problem. Maybe he should address his own insecurities rather than blocking her path. Also, the wife had already chosen to step back from grad school before, so changing her mind now might be her right to pursue her interests. \n\nBut the man is being honest about his feelings. However, the answer might depend on cultural perspectives. In some views, it's traditional for the man to be the breadwinner, but modern relationships often emphasize mutual support. The key here is whether his opposition is justified. Since the wife is making a choice that aligns with her dreams and the financial aspect is manageable, the man's stance could be seen as hindering her growth. Therefore, he might be in the wrong.\n"
