I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the question is whether it's wrong for him to not want his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the couple is in their late 20s. The husband makes enough to live comfortably on his own salary. The wife currently works but earns less than half of what he does. They don't plan to have kids, so there's no immediate financial pressure. The wife had put her grad school plans on hold when he was getting his master's, and she found a job she loves. Now, her wealthy parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which would lead to a higher salary than the husband's. The husband is against her going back, not because of the practical reasons but because he feels emasculated if she makes more than him.\n\nHmm. The husband's main issue seems to be his own ego and gender role expectations. He admits he likes being the breadwinner and would feel emasculated otherwise. That's a personal feeling, but is it valid? Let's consider the wife's perspective. She has a chance to pursue her dream, which she had been interested in before. She's being offered financial support from her parents, so there's no financial burden on the couple. The husband's argument isn't about practicality\u2014like financial need or lack of resources\u2014but about his self-esteem. \n\nSocietally, many people might argue that a person's self-worth shouldn't be tied to their income relative to their partner's. Encouraging a spouse to pursue their dreams is often seen as supportive. The husband's reluctance is based on personal insecurities rather than any objective reason. Even though the husband is in a comfortable financial position, his opposition is rooted in his own feelings about gender roles rather than the couple's actual needs.\n\nAlso, the wife had already put her education on hold once to support their relationship, but now she's excited to pursue it. The husband's reaction might be dismissive of her aspirations. Even if he's not happy, he should be supportive unless there's a valid reason. Since her parents are covering the costs, there's no financial burden. The husband's stance could be seen as controlling or not respecting her autonomy.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author is in the wrong because his opposition is based on his own ego rather than considering his wife's happiness and goals. It's important in relationships to support each other's growth, even if it affects one's personal feelings. So the answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
