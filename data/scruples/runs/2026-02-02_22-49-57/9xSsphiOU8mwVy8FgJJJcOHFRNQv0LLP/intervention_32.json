I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about a husband not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the husband feels it's not wrong because he's the main breadwinner, and he gets a sense of self-worth from that. He's worried about feeling emasculated. But on the other hand, the wife is considering going back to school because she's interested in a different career path. Her parents are even offering to cover the costs. \n\nI need to consider different perspectives. The husband's main issue seems to be his ego\u2014feeling that being the higher earner gives him a sense of being \"good enough.\" That's a personal feeling, but should it affect his wife's career choices? The wife made sacrifices before by putting her grad plans on hold to support him during his studies. Now, she's taking a chance to pursue her own dream with financial support from her parents. \n\nSociety often pushes the idea that men should be the primary earners, but that's changing. Equality in partnerships is important. If the husband is against her pursuing a better career just because he doesn't want to make less, that might be self-centered. Even though they don't need the money, her career choice is about her fulfillment. \n\nAlso, the husband's reasoning is based on personal feelings rather than practical needs. The wife's happiness and career growth should be her priority, not his ego. The fact that they don't plan to have kids removes practical concerns about needing more money. \n\nSo, even if he's not in the wrong from his own perspective, his stance is problematic because it's about his insecurities rather than her aspirations. The wife's decision should be based on her own desires and not her husband's need to feel dominant. Therefore, the husband is in the wrong for not supporting his wife's ambitions due to his own insecurities.\n"
