I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would earn her more than him. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The husband makes enough for them to live comfortably, and they don't have kids. The wife had put her grad school plans on hold to work and support them financially. Now, her parents are offering to pay for her grad studies, which would lead to a higher salary than his current one.\n\nThe husband's stated reason is feeling emasculated if he's the lower earner. That's a classic case of ego or traditional gender role issues. But is that a valid reason to discourage her? From a modern perspective, supporting a partner's career goals is usually encouraged unless there's a genuine financial hardship. Here, they don't need the money, so financial reasons aren't a factor. \n\nHe mentions that she loves her current job but is pursuing another path. Respecting her choice to follow her dream, even if it's a different field, is important. The husband's feelings about being the breadwinner are his own, but they shouldn't override her aspirations. \n\nAlso, her parents' motivation might be their own embarrassment, but the wife's decision is about her own interests. The husband's initial reaction is based on his insecurities rather than her needs or desires. \n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the husband is prioritizing his own feelings over his wife's ambitions. That's a problem in a healthy relationship where mutual support is key. Even if his feelings are real, they shouldn't dictate her career choices, especially when there's no financial necessity. So, the answer would lean towards AITA (Author is in the wrong) because he's not respecting her autonomy and is letting his ego affect her decisions.\n"
