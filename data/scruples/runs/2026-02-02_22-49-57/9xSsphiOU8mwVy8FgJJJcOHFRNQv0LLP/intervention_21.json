I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that might make her earn more than him. The situation involves the wife considering a graduate program paid by her parents, which could lead to higher earnings. The author admits feeling emasculated if he made less than her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author is concerned about financial roles and his self-esteem. But is it wrong to feel that way? Well, traditional gender roles might suggest that the man should be the primary earner, but modern relationships often prioritize mutual support and individual growth. The wife already gave up her grad school plans to support him during his studies. Now she's pursuing her own dreams with family support.\n\nThe author's reasoning is based on personal feelings of being the breadwinner. However, this might be a form of insecurity or outdated notions of masculinity. The wife's decision to pursue her education and career is about her own aspirations, not just money. The author is discouraging her based on his own ego rather than her wants and needs.\n\nFinancially, they can afford for her to go to school, so there's no hardship involved. The wife is making a choice that's beneficial for her personal development. The author's opposition is rooted in his own emotional response rather than practical concerns. This could hinder the wife's autonomy and growth, which is a problem in a healthy relationship where both partners support each other's goals.\n\nSo, even though the author's feelings are valid, they shouldn't dictate the wife's career choices. The answer is AITA (Am I the A**hole?), and based on this analysis, the author is in the wrong because his reasoning is self-centered and doesn't support his wife's aspirations. The correct answer should be A.\n"
