I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the husband doesn't want his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. They don't have kids, and he's the main breadwinner. The wife is considering going back to grad school with her parents' help, which would lead to a higher salary. The husband feels emasculated at the thought of making less than her.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband admits his reason is about feeling emasculated and not wanting to make less. That seems to be the crux of the issue. The wife, on the other hand, wants to pursue her dream, even though she loves her current job. She's been offered financial support from her parents, so the cost isn't the main barrier. \n\nIn terms of societal norms, traditionally, men were seen as the primary earners, but modern relationships often emphasize equality and mutual support. The husband's concern about his self-worth being tied to his income compared to his wife's might be problematic. It's important to consider if his feelings are valid, but also if they're hindering his wife's personal growth and career aspirations.\n\nThe wife had previously put her studies on hold to support the relationship, and now she's reconsidering. Does the husband have a right to influence her career decisions? If the wife is making an informed choice that aligns with her goals, the husband's opposition based on his ego might be seen as self-centered. However, if they have a financial arrangement where he supports both, he might be worried about the shift, but they don't need more money since they live comfortably.\n\nAlso, the husband's admission that he would feel \"emasculated\" is a red flag. It suggests his self-esteem is tied to his income relative to his wife's, which isn't healthy. The fact that they don't need the extra income might make his opposition even more about his own insecurities rather than practical concerns.\n\nAnother angle: the wife's parents are wealthy and offering to cover her education. The husband is the one who initially supported her not going to grad school when she was with him, but now she's considering it again. He should respect her autonomy, especially since she's making her own decisions now with financial support from her family. His resistance could be seen as controlling or not supporting her personal goals.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the husband is in a position where he can afford to let her pursue her education without financial strain. His opposition lacks valid practical reasons, focusing instead on his own feelings. In a healthy relationship, both partners should support each other's growth, even if it changes their roles. The husband's unwillingness to do so might make him the \"asshole\" in this scenario.\n\nHowever, some might argue that it's okay for individuals to have preferences in their relationships. But when those preferences hinder a partner's aspirations without good reason, it's a problem. The key is whether the husband's feelings are a legitimate concern or an excuse to maintain traditional gender roles. Given the husband's own admission about feeling emasculated, it seems more about his ego than practicality.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author (husband) is in the wrong because his opposition is based on his personal insecurities rather than supporting his wife's career goals. The answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
