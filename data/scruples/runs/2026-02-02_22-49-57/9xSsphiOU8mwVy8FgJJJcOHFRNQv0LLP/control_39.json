I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the AITA scenario is in the wrong. The author is a husband who doesn't want his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. His main issue is feeling emasculated if she makes more, even though they can live comfortably on his salary.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the societal norms and personal autonomy. The wife is offered a chance to go to grad school, which she's excited about. She already put her plans on hold before to support him while he got his master's. Now she's reconsidering, and the husband is against it because of his own ego. That seems like a problem because he's prioritizing his feelings over her aspirations.\n\nThe husband's argument is that he likes being the breadwinner and feels good about supporting them. But that's his personal insecurity. The wife's career choice should be her decision, especially since they don't need the money. Her parents are paying for the education, so there's no financial burden on them. The husband's reasoning is based on his need for validation through being the higher earner, which is a classic case of ego over supporting her goals.\n\nAlso, the fact that he's not happy about her pursuing her dream, even though she loves her current job but still wants to follow a different path, shows he's not fully supportive. In a healthy relationship, the partner should support each other's ambitions regardless of financial implications. The husband's reaction could be seen as controlling or dismissive of her desires.\n\nAnother point is that the wife already made a sacrifice by putting her education on hold for him. Now he's not encouraging her to take this opportunity. That's a bit hypocritical and unfair. The husband's comfort and ego shouldn't come at the expense of her growth and fulfillment.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because he's letting his personal insecurities interfere with his wife's career aspirations. He should support her decision if she's genuinely excited about it, regardless of his feelings about being the breadwinner.\n"
