I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong.\n\nThe situation is that the husband (the author) doesn't want his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. He's worried about feeling emasculated even though their financial situation is comfortable. His wife previously put her grad school plans on hold to work and support them during his master's. Now, her wealthy parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which would lead to a higher salary. The author expresses discomfort with her making more than him, despite acknowledging it's a valid career choice.\n\nFirst, let's consider the husband's perspective. He's being honest about his feelings of emasculation if his wife earns more. This is a personal feeling, and while it's not uncommon for some people to feel that way, it's important to evaluate whether this feeling justifies discouraging his wife's ambitions. The wife has already made a career choice that she's loving, but now wants to pursue a new path she's passionate about. The husband's resistance seems to stem from his own ego rather than her actual needs or desires.\n\nFrom the wife's standpoint, she's being offered a chance to further her education and career, which was something she was interested in before. Her parents' financial support removes the financial burden, making it a viable option. She's already indicated that she loves her current job but wants to pursue a different dream. The husband's opposition could be seen as undermining her autonomy and aspirations.\n\nThe key points here are the husband's emotional response versus the wife's personal and professional goals. The husband is prioritizing his self-esteem over his wife's potential growth. Even though their financial situation is secure, the husband's feelings about being the primary earner could lead to future conflicts. It's also worth noting that his initial support for her decision to work during his studies shows he's been supportive in the past, but his current stance may be conflicting with that.\n\nIn terms of fairness, a healthy relationship should support each other's ambitions unless there's a compelling reason not to. The husband's reason here is his own ego, which is a personal issue rather than a valid concern about their financial stability. The wife has the right to pursue her interests, especially when supported by her family. The husband's discomfort with the idea of his wife earning more could lead to resentment if not addressed, and it's important for him to reflect on why this feels like a threat to his identity.\n\nSo, putting this together: the husband's feelings are valid, but his response to them is problematic. He's not wrong for having those feelings, but he's in the wrong for discouraging his wife's legitimate career path based on his own insecurities. The answer would be A, meaning he is in the wrong.\n"
