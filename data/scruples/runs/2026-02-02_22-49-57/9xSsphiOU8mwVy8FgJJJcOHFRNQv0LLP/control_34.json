I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that might make her earn more than him. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife is currently working but making less than half of what the husband does. They don't plan to have kids, so financial needs aren't an issue. The husband is okay with her making less, but when her parents offer to pay for grad school, which could lead her to earn more, he's against it.\n\nThe main reasons given are his feelings about being the breadwinner and feeling emasculated if she makes more. He also mentions that he thought she wasn't interested in grad school anymore. The wife, however, feels she wants to pursue her dream despite loving her current job. \n\nNow, considering gender roles and societal expectations, it's clear the husband's concern is rooted in traditional views of masculinity tied to financial dominance. However, many modern relationships value individual growth and mutual support regardless of income. The husband's objection is based on his personal feelings rather than the wife's best interests or their relationship's practical needs. \n\nIs he wrong for that? Well, if the relationship is built on mutual respect and support, then his hesitation could be seen as undermining her ambitions. Even though he's financially supporting them, the wife's career choice is her own. His feelings about it shouldn't dictate her decisions, especially when there's no financial pressure. \n\nAlso, the fact that he's comfortable with their current financial status but resistant to change because of his ego might be the crux. The AITA aspect usually looks at whether the action is fair or if it's a personal issue. Here, the husband's stance is more about his self-esteem, which isn't a valid reason to hinder his wife's aspirations. \n\nSo, the answer would likely be A, that he's in the wrong, because he's letting his feelings about being the breadwinner override her potential happiness and growth. Even if his reasoning is personal, it's not a good reason to discourage her from pursuing a better opportunity.\n"
