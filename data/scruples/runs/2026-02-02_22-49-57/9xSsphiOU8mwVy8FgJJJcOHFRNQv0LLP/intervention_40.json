I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is a man in his late 20s married to a woman who currently works but makes less than half of his salary. They don't plan on having kids, so there's no financial pressure to increase their income. His wife previously put her grad school plans on hold to work full-time and support them, and she's been in a job she loves since. Now, her wealthy parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which would lead to a higher salary than he makes. He's against her pursuing it because he feels emasculated if she makes more than him, even though they don't need the money. He's aware his reasoning is unpopular but feels that way.\n\nThe user's initial thought is that the author isn't wrong, but they want to know what I think. The question is whether he's in the wrong. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I should consider the dynamics here. The wife has a valid opportunity, supported by her parents, to further her education and career. The husband's main objection is based on his own ego\u2014feeling emasculated if she makes more. That's a personal feeling, but is it a valid reason to discourage her from a path she wants to take?\n\nIn terms of fairness, the wife is pursuing her own goals, which align with her interests and potential. The husband isn't wrong for feeling that way, but is he wrong to act on it? If he's discouraging her from a legitimate opportunity because of his own insecurities, that could be seen as selfish. He's prioritizing his emotional needs over her aspirations. \n\nAlso, the husband's reasoning isn't based on practical concerns like financial necessity or the wife's well-being, but rather his own pride. Even though they live comfortably, his stance might prevent her from achieving personal growth and career satisfaction. In a healthy partnership, supporting each other's goals is important. If he's not supportive, that could be a problem. \n\nHowever, some might argue that he has the right to his feelings, and if the wife can handle the situation and still pursue her goals despite his disapproval, then maybe he's not in the wrong for expressing his thoughts. But the fact that he's actively discouraging her could be problematic. \n\nAnother angle: the wife already made a past sacrifice by putting her education on hold. Now she's revisiting her dreams. The husband's opposition could undermine her autonomy and her long-term happiness. If their relationship is based on mutual support, his attitude might not align with that.\n\nSo, putting it all together, while the husband's feelings are valid, his actions (opposing her for selfish reasons) might be wrong. He's not in the right for prioritizing his ego over his wife's aspirations. Therefore, the answer might be A (he is in the wrong). But I need to make sure there's no nuance I'm missing. For example, if the wife is still open to pursuing it despite his disapproval, maybe the husband isn't stopping her, but the question is about whether he's wrong for not wanting her to. The key issue is the reason behind his objection, which is his own insecurities rather than her best interest. So the answer is A.\n"
