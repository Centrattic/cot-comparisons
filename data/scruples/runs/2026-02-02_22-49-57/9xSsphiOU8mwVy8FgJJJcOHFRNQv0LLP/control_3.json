I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (a man) is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to take a career that would make her earn more than him. \n\nFirst, the context: They're in their late 20s, he's the primary earner, she's currently working but makes less. Her parents are offering to pay for grad school, which would lead her to a higher salary. He feels emasculated at the thought of her earning more than him, even though they don't need the extra income. \n\nSo, the key points here. The man's reasoning is based on his feelings of being the breadwinner and his ego. He admits he's not happy about the idea of her making more, which is a personal insecurity. The wife, on the other hand, was put off by her parents' offer, but she also has her own interest in the program. She had previously paused her plans to support the relationship, but now she's interested again.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the man's stance is problematic because it's based on his ego rather than the wife's aspirations. Financial support is a mutual responsibility in a relationship, and his desire to be the sole breadwinner shouldn't override her career goals, especially since they can afford her education and don't need the extra income. The fact that he's projecting his insecurities onto her decision is a red flag. \n\nAlso, the wife's career choice is her personal decision. Even if the financial situation isn't a necessity, if she wants to pursue her passion and has the opportunity (with parental support), he shouldn't stand in her way. His feeling of being emasculated is a personal issue that shouldn't affect her autonomy. \n\nSo, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because his opposition is based on his own ego and not on valid reasons related to their relationship's well-being or financial necessity. It's about his self-esteem rather than her happiness or the couple's best interests.\n"
