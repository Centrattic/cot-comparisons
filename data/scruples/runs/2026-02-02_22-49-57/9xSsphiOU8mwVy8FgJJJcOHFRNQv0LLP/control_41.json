I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. \n\nFirst, the husband's reasoning is that he likes being the breadwinner and feels emasculated if he makes less. He's comfortable financially, so there's no necessity for her to earn more. The wife gave up her grad school plans before to support him when he was in school, and now she's considering going back because her parents are offering to pay.\n\nOn one hand, the husband's feelings about being the primary earner are his personal emotions. It's his right to feel that way, but does that justify trying to control his wife's career choices? On the other hand, the wife has the right to pursue her dreams and education, especially if she's passionate about it. The husband's objection seems based on his ego rather than practical reasons. \n\nThe wife's parents funding her education might add pressure, but she's making the decision for herself. The husband's concern isn't about financial necessity but his self-worth tied to income. That's problematic because it could stifle her autonomy and personal growth. \n\nIn a healthy relationship, both partners should support each other's ambitions unless there's a mutual, well-considered reason against it. Here, the husband's reasons are self-centered. So, he's likely in the wrong for not supporting her decision based on his own insecurities rather than practical concerns.\n"
