I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. The key points here are the author's reasons. He mentions that he's the main breadwinner, and he feels emasculated if he makes less. They don't have kids and live comfortably on his salary.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and emotional aspects. The wife wants to pursue her dream, which is supported by her parents financially. She had put her grad school plans on hold earlier to support the relationship, which he acknowledges. Now she's excited about this opportunity. The author's primary concern is his own ego and feeling about being the breadwinner, not financial necessity or other practical reasons.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the wife has a right to pursue her career goals. The husband's objection seems to stem from personal feelings of inadequacy rather than the well-being of the relationship or practical issues. Even though they don't need the money, her career choice is her decision. The husband's stance could be seen as controlling or not respecting her autonomy. Additionally, the fact that he's projecting his own insecurities onto the situation raises red flags about his mindset.\n\nHowever, the husband might argue that he's been the sole provider and it's a comfort to him. But the core issue is that he's unhappy about the financial hierarchy shifting. Societal norms have evolved, and many people now view equality in partnerships as important, regardless of income. The husband's reasoning might not be in the wife's best interest but rather his own emotional needs.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would likely be A (the author is in the wrong) because his objection is based on personal ego rather than the couple's actual needs or her aspirations. Supporting a partner's career growth is generally considered important in a healthy relationship.\n"
