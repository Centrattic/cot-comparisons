I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a higher-paying career. The wife's parents offered to cover her grad school expenses, which would lead her to earn more than him.\n\nFirst, the husband admits his main concern is feeling emasculated if he's not the breadwinner. That's a red flag. It seems like his feelings about self-worth are tied to financial status in his relationship, which is problematic. In healthy relationships, both partners' individual goals and ambitions are supported, regardless of income levels. The husband's opposition is based on his own insecurities rather than objective reasons like the wife's happiness or the couple's financial needs.\n\nThe wife chose to put her grad plans on hold earlier to support the husband during his master's. Now she's excited about pursuing her own dream, and her parents are helping financially. The husband's resistance isn't about practical issues (like financial strain) but his ego. The fact that they don't plan to have kids and live comfortably on his salary doesn't justify him hindering her potential. Supporting each other's growth is key in a partnership. If he's not supportive because of his own pride, that's not fair to her. \n\nAlso, the husband claims he's not against her career but the issue is his own insecurities. That makes it about his own issues, not hers. The wife's happiness and career aspirations should take precedence unless there's a valid financial reason, which there isn't here. So, yeah, the husband is in the wrong.\n"
