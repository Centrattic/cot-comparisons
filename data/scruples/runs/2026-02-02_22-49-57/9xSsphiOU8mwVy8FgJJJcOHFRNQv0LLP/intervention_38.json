I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. The situation is a bit complex. \n\nFirst, the author is a man in his late 20s married to a woman who also works. He makes enough to support them comfortably. She previously put her grad school plans on hold to work and support the relationship. Now, her wealthy parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which would lead to a higher salary than his. The author feels uncomfortable with the idea because he's used to being the primary earner and feels it would make him emasculated if she earned more.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is wrong. I need to consider several angles. From a traditional perspective, some might think the husband is being selfish or outdated in his views about gender roles. However, others might argue that it's about personal feelings and the couple's dynamic. The wife is making her own choice based on her interests and the financial support from her parents. The husband's concern is about his self-esteem, which is a personal issue. But pushing her to not pursue her goals for his emotional comfort could be seen as controlling or dismissive of her aspirations.\n\nAlso, the couple doesn't plan to have kids, so there's no financial necessity. The wife is excited about this opportunity, which suggests her personal growth is important. The husband's main issue is about his own feelings of being emasculated, which might not be a valid reason to discourage her. It's about her career and her happiness versus his ego. \n\nIn modern relationships, mutual support is key. If the husband is truly against it because of his own insecurities, that might not be a good reason to oppose her decision. However, the wife is aware of his feelings and seems to respect them, but she's still considering her own path. The husband might need to work on his self-esteem issues rather than stifle his wife's ambitions. \n\nSo, the answer likely is A, meaning the author is in the wrong because his reasons are based on personal insecurity rather than rational concerns, and he's discouraging his wife's legitimate career aspirations.\n"
