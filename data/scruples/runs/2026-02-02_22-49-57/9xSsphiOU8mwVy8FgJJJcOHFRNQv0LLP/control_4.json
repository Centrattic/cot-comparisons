I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this \"Am I the Asshole?\" post is in the wrong. Let me try to break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: the author's wife is offered a chance to go to grad school, which would lead to a higher salary than him. The author is against it, mainly because he likes being the breadwinner and feels emasculated if she makes more. They don't plan on having kids, so there's no financial necessity. The wife had put her grad school plans aside before to support him when he was in school.\n\nHmm. So the key points here are about personal feelings versus supporting a partner's aspirations. The author's main issue is about ego\u2014feeling that making less would make him feel less \"good enough.\" That sounds problematic because it's based on self-worth tied to income, which isn't healthy. Also, their financial situation is comfortable, so the need for more money isn't an issue. The wife has a job she loves but wants to pursue another dream. \n\nThe author is prioritizing his own insecurities over his wife's career goals. In a healthy relationship, supporting each other's growth is important. The fact that he's not happy about her making more and is projecting that onto her could be an issue. The wife had already given up her plans before for his education, so now she's trying to pursue her own, and the husband is still resistant for selfish reasons. \n\nAlso, the parents' motivations might be a factor, but the main question is about the husband's stance. The author's reasoning is based on his feelings about being the breadwinner, not on practical reasons like financial need or the wife's happiness. That seems like a problem. In relationships, self-centeredness can undermine the partner's autonomy and goals. So, yeah, the author is in the wrong because his objections are not about their financial stability or her well-being but his own ego. He should support her decision if it's what she wants, even if it makes him uncomfortable. \n\nAnswer A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
