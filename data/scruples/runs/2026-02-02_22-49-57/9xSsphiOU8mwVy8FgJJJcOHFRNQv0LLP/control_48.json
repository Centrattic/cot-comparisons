I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is about a husband who doesn't want his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. They don't have kids, and he's the main breadwinner. The wife's parents offered to pay for her grad school, which could lead to a higher salary.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The husband admits that his main reason is feeling emasculated if he makes less. That's a personal feeling, but does that justify preventing his wife from pursuing her goals? The wife is interested in going back to school for her own reasons, like pursuing a dream, even though she loves her current job. \n\nThe husband supported her when she put her grad plans on hold to work full-time, but now he's against her going back. The wife's parents are wealthy and covering the costs, so financially it's feasible. The husband's objection isn't about practical issues like money or childcare but about his own ego. \n\nIn a healthy relationship, both partners should support each other's growth and ambitions. The husband's hesitation is based on his self-esteem rather than genuine concerns about their situation. He also mentions that they live comfortably, so there's no financial necessity. The wife's career choice is her own decision, and the husband's feelings shouldn't override her aspirations. \n\nEven though he's honest about his feelings, it's important to respect her autonomy. The fact that he's the primary earner now doesn't mean he should control her future. The wife might feel unvalued if her husband doesn't support her growth. So, the author is in the wrong because his reasoning is self-centered and doesn't respect his wife's desires and potential.\n"
