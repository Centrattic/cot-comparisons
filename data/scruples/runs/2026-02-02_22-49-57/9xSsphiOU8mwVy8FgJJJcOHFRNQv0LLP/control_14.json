I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by understanding the situation. The author is a man whose wife works but makes less than half of his salary. They live comfortably on his income alone, and they don't plan to have kids. The wife's parents offered to pay for her graduate school, which she's interested in, even though she had put it on hold before. The author is against her pursuing it because he feels it would make him feel emasculated if she earns more than him. \n\nFirst, I should consider the dynamics of their relationship. The wife gave up her grad school plans to support him when he was in school. Now she wants to go back for her own reasons, even though it's a different career path. The author's main issue is about being the breadwinner and feeling emasculated if she makes more. \n\nI need to think about the fairness here. The wife is choosing to pursue her interests and education, which parents are paying for. The author's financial situation is stable, so there's no financial pressure. His objection seems to stem from personal feelings about status rather than any practical concerns. \n\nIs it wrong for him to feel that way? Well, everyone has their own insecurities. However, the fact that he's the one who initially wanted her to stay in a job she likes just so he can be the breadwinner might be an issue. Also, the wife's right to pursue her education and career should be respected, especially since they don't need the extra money. \n\nThe author's reasoning is that he feels emasculated, but that's a personal feeling. However, in a healthy relationship, supporting each other's goals is important. If his feelings are making him oppose her decision, that could be problematic. The wife might feel undervalued or not supported. \n\nAnother angle: the author's argument is based on his emotional needs, but the wife's decision is about her own aspirations. It's her body, her time, her education. Unless there are other factors like financial contributions from the author, but the parents are covering her tuition. \n\nIn terms of societal expectations, traditional gender roles might play a part here. The author might be feeling pressure from those norms. However, modern relationships often emphasize equality. If the wife wants to take this opportunity, it's her choice unless there's a mutual agreement. \n\nThere's no mention of the wife needing the money; the parents are paying. So it's purely about her personal and professional growth. The author's stance could be seen as selfish because he's prioritizing his ego over her ambitions. \n\nBut some might argue that the author is not the one who's being wronged here. He's honest about his feelings, even though they might not be popular. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since the wife is making a choice that's in her interest and the author's opposition is based on his own insecurities, it's likely he's in the wrong. \n\nAlso, the fact that they don't have kids and live comfortably means there's no practical need to oppose her education. The author's concern is about his self-esteem, which is a personal issue. It's his responsibility to work on those feelings rather than impose them on his wife's decisions. \n\nTherefore, the answer would be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he's letting his insecurities affect his support for his wife's aspirations without valid reasons related to their financial situation or her well-being.\n"
