I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author mentions that he's the primary breadwinner, and they live comfortably on his salary. His wife is considering going back to grad school, which is paid for by her wealthy parents. The main issue seems to be his discomfort with her earning more than him, leading to potential feelings of emasculation. \n\nI should consider societal norms and expectations. Traditionally, some people might hold onto the idea of the man being the sole breadwinner, but modern relationships often emphasize equality and mutual support. The author's reasoning is based on his own insecurities rather than practical concerns like financial need. Since they don't need the extra income and she wants to pursue her dream, his opposition seems rooted in personal ego rather than the couple's best interest.\n\nAlso, the wife has already made compromises in the past by putting her education on hold to support him. Now she's getting an opportunity that's financially supported, which might not have been possible before. The author's reluctance to support her in this could be seen as not respecting her aspirations and the sacrifices she made earlier.\n\nHowever, some might argue that it's his right to express his feelings. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's being selfish and not supporting his partner's growth, then yes, he's in the wrong. The key here is whether his stance is valid or not. His justification is about feeling emasculated, which isn't a valid reason to oppose her career move. Healthy relationships should encourage each other's growth regardless of income levels.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because his opposition is based on personal insecurity rather than rational reasons, and it's not supporting his wife's aspirations even though there's no financial necessity. Therefore, the answer should be A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
