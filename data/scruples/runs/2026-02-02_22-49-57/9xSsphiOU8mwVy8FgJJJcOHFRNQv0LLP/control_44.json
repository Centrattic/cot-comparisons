I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about the husband not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context. The husband makes enough for them to live comfortably, and his wife currently earns less. They don't plan to have kids, so no financial necessity. The wife had put her grad school plans aside when he was doing his master's, and now her parents are offering to fund her education. She wants to go back, but the husband is against it because he feels it would make him feel emasculated if she earns more. \n\nThe key points here are the husband's reasons. He's worried about being the primary breadwinner and feeling emasculated. The wife is pursuing her own career goals, which is a personal choice. The husband's objection isn't about financial hardship but his own emotional response. \n\nIn relationships, supporting each other's personal and professional growth is important. If the husband is preventing his wife from pursuing her dreams based on his insecurities, that's a problem. His feelings are valid but not a justification to restrict her choices. Also, the fact that they can afford her education without financial stress means there's no real hardship involved. \n\nThe husband's reasoning is self-centered. The wife's decision is about her own aspirations and potential. The husband should ideally support her, even if it changes their dynamic. Feeling emasculated based on income is a societal issue, but in a healthy relationship, partners should encourage each other's success regardless of earnings. \n\nSo, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because his resistance is based on personal insecurities rather than practical concerns, and it's preventing his wife from growing in her career.\n"
