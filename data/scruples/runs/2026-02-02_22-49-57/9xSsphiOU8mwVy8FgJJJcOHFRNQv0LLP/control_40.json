I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this AITA question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. Let me break down the scenario.\n\nFirst, the husband and wife are in their late 20s. He's the primary breadwinner, making more than enough for them to live comfortably. She works but earns less than half of his salary. They don't plan to have kids, so there's no need for more income. Her parents offered to pay for her grad school, which could lead to a higher salary than his current job. He's against it because he feels it would make him feel emasculated if she makes more than him.\n\nHmm, the key points here are his emotional response and the potential impact on her career. The wife put her grad school plans on hold when he was in school, and now she's considering returning. He's expressing his discomfort about being the lower earner, even though their financial situation is stable.\n\nThe question is whether his reasons are valid. On one hand, he's being honest about his feelings. But on the other hand, his concern is about his ego rather than practical reasons. The wife's career choice is her right, and he shouldn't hinder her personal growth just to maintain his self-image. Also, they don't need the extra money, so the issue isn't financial necessity but his personal feelings.\n\nSociety often criticizes men for feeling emasculated when their partner earns more, but that doesn't mean the feeling doesn't exist. However, the husband's stance is about his ego, not any real harm to her. The wife is making a decision based on her dreams, which is important. The husband's role here is to support her, even if it affects his self-perception.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the wife's career is her own. The husband's objection is self-centered. Even though he's being honest, it's about his insecurities, not her best interests. So, the answer is likely A (he's in the wrong) because he's prioritizing his feelings over her aspirations.\n"
