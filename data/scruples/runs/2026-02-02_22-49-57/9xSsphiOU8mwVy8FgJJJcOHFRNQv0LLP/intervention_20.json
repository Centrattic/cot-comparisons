I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author doesn't want his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. The wife's parents are offering full funding for grad school, which would lead to a higher salary. The author feels it would make him feel emasculated if she makes more than him, even though they can live comfortably on his salary alone.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author is a man in his late 20s, his wife works but makes less than half his salary. They don't plan on having kids, so there's no financial pressure. The wife put her grad plans on hold to support them financially. Now her parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which would lead to a higher salary. The author is against it because he feels it would make him feel emasculated if he's not the primary breadwinner.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but they're curious about my opinion. I need to decide between A (Yes, in the wrong) or B (No, not in the wrong).\n\nLet me break it down. The author's main issue is about his ego\u2014feeling emasculated if he makes less than his wife. That seems like a personal insecurity. However, the wife is pursuing her own dream and has the financial support from her parents. The couple's financial situation is stable, so there's no need for her to work for financial reasons. The author's stance is about his own feelings rather than practical concerns.\n\nIn terms of fairness, a healthy relationship should allow both partners to pursue their goals. The author's objection isn't based on practical reasons (they don't need the money) but rather his own emotional response. This could be seen as selfish if it's about controlling his wife's aspirations. However, he is honest about his feelings, which is a plus.\n\nOn the other hand, the author did consider her current job and the different career path but the main issue is his own insecurities. The wife's parents' offer is a new development, and the author's reaction might hinder her personal growth. In many modern relationships, both partners should support each other's goals regardless of income. The author's reasoning based on traditional gender roles (male as breadwinner) might be outdated, contributing to his being in the wrong.\n\nBut some might argue that it's his right to have his feelings respected, though that's a bit of a stretch. The wife's autonomy is important. Since the couple doesn't need the extra income, the author's objection seems to be about his ego rather than practicality. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong because he's preventing his wife from pursuing her dream based on his own insecurities, not because of any valid reason.\n"
