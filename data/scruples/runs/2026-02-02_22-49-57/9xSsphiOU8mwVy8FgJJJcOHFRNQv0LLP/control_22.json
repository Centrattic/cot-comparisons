I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (a man) is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him.\n\nFirst, the key points from the scenario: The wife is considering going back to grad school with her parents' support, which would lead to a higher salary than his current one. The husband is okay with their current financial setup where he's the sole provider, and he's uncomfortable with the idea of her making more. He admits he feels emasculated if he's not the higher earner.\n\nNow, the ethical angle here. Traditional gender roles often emphasize the man as the primary breadwinner, but in modern times, many people advocate for equality in partnerships regardless of income. The husband's concern is based on his personal feelings of self-worth tied to being the higher earner. However, this is a personal issue and doesn't consider his wife's aspirations or the changing dynamics of relationships.\n\nThe wife has already made personal sacrifices by putting her grad school plans on hold to support the couple financially. Now, she's excited about pursuing her dream, which could be a significant personal achievement. The husband's opposition seems to stem from his own ego rather than the practical needs of the couple, who don't need more income since they're living comfortably. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the wife has the right to pursue her career and education as she wishes. The husband's financial contributions are appreciated, but his wife's personal growth and career goals are equally valid. The husband's feeling of emasculation is a personal insecurity, and it's not right to hinder someone's goals based on that. \n\nAlso, the scenario mentions that the couple doesn't plan on having kids, so there's no financial pressure. The husband's stance could be seen as restrictive, prioritizing his own comfort over his wife's aspirations. In a healthy relationship, both partners should support each other's ambitions unless there's a mutual concern that affects the relationship's stability. Here, the husband's concern is purely about his own self-esteem, which shouldn't override his wife's desires.\n\nTherefore, the answer is A, meaning the author is in the wrong. He's letting his own feelings about traditional roles interfere with his wife's opportunities for personal and professional development.\n"
