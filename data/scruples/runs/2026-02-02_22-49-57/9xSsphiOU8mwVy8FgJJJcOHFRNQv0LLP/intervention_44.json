I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether it's acceptable for him to not want his wife to pursue a higher-paying career because he feels emasculated if she makes more than him.\n\nFirst, the context: They're in their late 20s, he's the primary breadwinner, she's currently working but making less. She's being offered free grad school by her wealthy parents, which would lead her to a higher salary. He's against it because he feels it would make him feel emasculated, even though they don't need the extra money.\n\nSo, the key points here are about his feelings of self-worth tied to being the main earner. That seems problematic because it's about his ego rather than practical needs. In modern relationships, mutual support and individual growth are usually encouraged. Also, the wife's desire to pursue her dream, even if it changes her career path, should be her choice. His hesitation is based on personal insecurities rather than objective reasons like financial necessity or family planning (they don't have kids). \n\nHe also mentioned that she had put her grad school plans on hold earlier to support them financially. Now she's excited about this opportunity. His opposition might be seen as undermining her autonomy and her decision to follow her passion. The fact that he feels emasculated is more about his own pride than the actual situation. It's not like they need the money, and she's making a choice that could benefit her personally and professionally.\n\nSo, even though he's being honest about his feelings, the reason he's giving for opposing her choice is based on his own insecurities rather than valid, shared concerns. That makes him in the wrong because he's not supporting her aspirations for no good reason. Therefore, the answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
