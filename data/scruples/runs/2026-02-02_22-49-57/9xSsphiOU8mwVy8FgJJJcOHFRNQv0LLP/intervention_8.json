I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. The situation is a bit complex, so I need to consider different angles.\n\nFirst, the author admits that he's uncomfortable with the idea because he feels like being the breadwinner is important to him. He mentions feeling emasculated if his wife makes more. That's a personal feeling, but is it valid? There's a societal expectation here, but in modern relationships, it's becoming more common for both partners to have careers, regardless of income levels. However, the user argues that since they don't need the extra money and he's already providing comfortably, maybe his concern isn't about financial necessity but his own ego.\n\nThen there's the aspect of his wife's autonomy. She's making a decision about her own education and career. The author is discouraging her because of his own insecurities, not because there's a financial need. That could be seen as undermining her goals. The wife's parents are offering to pay for her education, which removes the financial burden on them. So, it's not about money but about his personal feelings.\n\nAnother point is that the wife has already made a choice in the past to put her graduate plans on hold. Now she's reconsidering, which shows she's reevaluating her life goals. The author's reaction might be seen as resistant to her growth. In a healthy relationship, partners should support each other's aspirations unless there's a compelling reason against it. Here, the reason is the author's self-esteem, which isn't a strong justification.\n\nAlso, the fact that they don't plan to have kids removes another common reason for dual income. So, there's no practical need for her to increase her earnings. The author's main issue is emotional. While it's okay to have personal feelings, projecting those onto a partner's decisions can be problematic. The author is making a decision based on his own insecurities rather than the wife's best interests.\n\nIn terms of gender roles, the author is expressing a traditional view of masculinity tied to being the primary earner. But in modern contexts, many relationships don't adhere to this structure. The author's stance might be seen as archaic or selfish, especially if he's not considering the wife's happiness and career satisfaction.\n\nHowever, the author isn't forcing her to stay in her current job. He's sharing his concerns, and the wife is still making the decision. But his discouragement could create pressure indirectly. The key here is whether his feelings are a valid reason to dissuade her from a path she wants to take. Since the decision is hers, and the financial aspect isn't a concern, his reasons seem self-serving.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's feelings are understandable, they don't justify preventing his wife from pursuing her goals. Supporting each other's personal growth is crucial in a relationship. The author's focus on his ego rather than his wife's aspirations suggests he is in the wrong.\n"
