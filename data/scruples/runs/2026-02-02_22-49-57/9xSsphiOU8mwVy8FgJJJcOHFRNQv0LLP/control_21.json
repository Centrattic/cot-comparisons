I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The couple is in their late 20s. The husband is the primary breadwinner, making enough for them to live comfortably. The wife works but earns about half of his salary. They don't plan to have kids, so there's no need for her to increase her earning potential. During his master's, she put her grad school plans on hold to work full-time, and she's been happy in her job ever since. Now, her wealthy parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which would lead her to a higher salary than he makes. He's against it because he feels emasculated if he's not the higher earner.\n\nThe key points here are the husband's reasons. He's not opposed because it's a bad idea for her, but because he feels his self-worth is tied to being the higher earner. He admits this is an unpopular opinion. The wife seems interested in pursuing her dream, even though she loves her current job. The husband's objection is more about his ego than practical concerns like financial need or the feasibility of her switching careers.\n\nNow, societal norms and gender roles come into play. Traditionally, men might feel threatened or emasculated if they're not the higher earners. However, in modern times, such views are often criticized as outdated and harmful. The husband's stance could undermine his wife's autonomy and career aspirations. The fact that they can afford for her to pursue this without financial strain adds another layer\u2014there's no economic necessity, just his personal feelings.\n\nThe wife's parents are wealthy and covering her tuition, so financial barriers are removed. The husband's main issue is emotional, tied to his self-esteem. This could lead to resentment or conflict in the relationship if he's not supportive of her goals. Healthy relationships should encourage each other's growth, even if it means one partner surpasses the other in certain areas.\n\nAnother angle is the husband's initial surprise. He thought she had given up on grad school, but she still had her heart set on it. His reaction might have been dismissive or discouraging, which could be seen as not respecting her aspirations. Even if he's concerned, the way he communicates his feelings matters. It's important to support a partner's dreams unless there are valid, practical reasons against it, which in this case don't seem to apply beyond his own insecurities.\n\nIn conclusion, the husband's main issue is his own ego and outdated gender norms rather than the wife's best interests. He's in the wrong because he's prioritizing his feelings over his wife's career and personal fulfillment. The right approach would involve supporting her decision, even if it makes him uncomfortable, and addressing his own insecurities through communication or counseling rather than discouraging her.\n"
