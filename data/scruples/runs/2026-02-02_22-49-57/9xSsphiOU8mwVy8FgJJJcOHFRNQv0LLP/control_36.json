I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. \n\nFirst, the author's main issue seems to be about feeling emasculated if his wife earns more. He mentions that they live comfortably on his salary, and he's grown into the role of being the primary breadwinner. The wife had put her grad school plans on hold to support him when he was in school. Now, her parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which could lead to a higher salary.\n\nThe key points here are financial independence, personal growth, and self-esteem. The author's reasoning is based on his own insecurities rather than the couple's financial needs. The wife is considering a path she's interested in, which is important for her personal development. The fact that they don't plan on having kids doesn't negate her right to pursue her goals. \n\nThere's also the aspect of the wife's previous sacrifices. She supported the author during his studies, and now she's excited about her own opportunities. The husband's opposition is based on his feelings of superiority in earning, which is a traditional and potentially harmful mindset. \n\nSociety often criticizes men who feel threatened by a partner's success, as it can lead to controlling or dismissive behavior. The husband's stance might hinder the wife's autonomy and career growth. Even though the husband provides for them, that doesn't mean the wife shouldn't have the freedom to pursue her ambitions. \n\nIn relationships, supporting each other's goals is crucial. The husband's focus on his own ego rather than his wife's aspirations makes him the antagonist here. The fact that the wife's parents are offering financial support removes the burden of tuition costs, making the decision more about her personal fulfillment. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because his decision is based on his insecurities, not practical reasons, and it undermines his wife's right to pursue her education and career.\n"
