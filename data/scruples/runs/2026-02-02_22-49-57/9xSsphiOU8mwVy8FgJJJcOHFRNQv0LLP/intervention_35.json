I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author is a husband who's uncomfortable with his wife pursuing a career that would make her earn more than him. He supports their lifestyle comfortably on his salary and feels that being the breadwinner is important for his self-esteem.\n\nFirst, I need to consider what's right or wrong in terms of personal values and relationships. In many modern discussions, equality in partnerships is emphasized, and both partners contributing equally is seen as ideal. However, the author is being honest about his feelings of emasculation if his wife earns more. That's a personal feeling, but the question is whether it's wrong to have that feeling or to express opposition based on it.\n\nThe wife chose to put her education on hold to support the author during his studies, which shows a sacrifice. Now she's excited about a new opportunity. The author's opposition isn't about her happiness or the feasibility of the plan but about his own ego. He acknowledges that they don't need the money, so his argument isn't based on practical needs but emotional ones.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the author is being honest. However, his stance might be harmful in the long run if it leads to resentment or if it prevents his wife from pursuing her dreams. The wife's happiness and career goals are important, and the author's primary concern is his own feelings. That could be seen as prioritizing his ego over his partner's aspirations.\n\nBut is he in the wrong? If he's being honest and the wife is free to choose despite his opinion, maybe not. However, if he's using his position or influence to discourage her, that could be problematic. The question is about whether his feelings make him wrong. From a modern perspective, valuing a partner's career and not wanting to feel inferior based on earnings might be seen as outdated or selfish. But from a personal standpoint, he's not lying about his feelings. It's a matter of whether his feelings justify opposing her decision.\n\nSo, the answer depends on whether being in the wrong is about the content of his feelings or the way he expressed them. If the question is about the content\u2014that is, whether it's wrong to feel emasculated by a wife earning more\u2014then it's a personal value judgment. However, if it's about whether his opposition is justified, then it's more about respecting her autonomy. Since the wife is making the choice herself, the author's feelings don't necessarily make him wrong, but they might not align with modern relationship ideals. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. If being in the wrong is about respecting her autonomy and supporting her decisions, then he's in the wrong. If it's about having personal feelings, then he's not.\n"
