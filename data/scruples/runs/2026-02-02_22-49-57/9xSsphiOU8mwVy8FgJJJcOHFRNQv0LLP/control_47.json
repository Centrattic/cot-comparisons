I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is about whether it's okay for him to not want his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. The user wants me to answer A (Yes, he's in the wrong) or B (No, he's not). \n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation from both sides. The author mentions that he's the primary breadwinner and that he feels emasculated if he made less. He also says they live comfortably on his salary alone and don't plan on having kids, so there's no financial necessity for her to increase her income. His wife is considering grad school because she wants to pursue her dream, even though she loves her current job. The parents are offering to pay for her education, which removes the financial burden.\n\nNow, the main issue here is his emotional response\u2014feeling emasculated. That's a personal feeling, but is it valid? In many modern relationships, both partners pursuing their own careers is common and accepted. The fact that she has the opportunity to go back to school and the support from her parents makes it more about her personal goals rather than a financial need. \n\nThe author's reasoning is based on his self-esteem being tied to being the breadwinner. That's a traditional view, but it's not necessarily right or wrong. However, the key point is whether he's wrong to oppose her decision. Since his wife's choice is about her aspirations and not causing financial strain, he's potentially undermining her autonomy and dreams because of his own ego. \n\nIn terms of fairness, a healthy relationship should support each other's goals unless there's a pressing reason against it. The author's reason here is personal insecurity, which doesn't justify opposition. He should be considering her happiness and aspirations rather than his own feelings of being the primary provider. The fact that they don't need the money makes it even more about her personal growth. \n\nSo, the answer is likely A (he's in the wrong) because he's prioritizing his ego over his wife's career aspirations and self-determination, especially when there's no financial need. But wait, does the question of \"ITA\" (if they're the asshole) depend on cultural context or individual feelings? While it's okay for someone to have feelings, acting against a partner's wishes because of those feelings might be considered selfish. \n\nAlso, he admitted he's not sure if it's a good idea but his wife is excited. He should respect her choice unless there are other factors. The fact that her parents are covering the costs means there's no financial pressure for him to support her career. So, he's not wrong in the financial aspect, but he is in the emotional and supportive aspect. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A.\n"
