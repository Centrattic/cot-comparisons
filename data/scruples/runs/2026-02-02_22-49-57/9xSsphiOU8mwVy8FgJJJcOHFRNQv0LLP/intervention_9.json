I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a higher-paying career. The author's reasoning is that he doesn't want her to earn more than him because it makes him feel emasculated, even though they can live comfortably on his income.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife has already made a choice to put her education on hold to support the author during his master's. Now, her parents are offering to fund her grad school, which could lead to a higher salary. The author is conflicted because he likes being the primary earner and feels threatened by the idea of her surpassing him financially.\n\nFrom a traditional perspective, some people might think that supporting a partner's career is important, regardless of the financial implications. However, the author is being honest about his feelings. The question is whether it's wrong to prioritize his own emotional needs over his wife's career aspirations.\n\nEmotional needs versus support for a partner's goals. The author isn't preventing her from going to school; he's expressing his discomfort. He even acknowledges that his reasons are unpopular. The key here is whether his feelings are valid. While it's true that financial equality or her making more isn't inherently problematic, the author's feelings of emasculation might stem from societal conditioning about gender roles. It's also important to note that the wife is making the choice, and the author isn't forcing her. They also don't have kids, so the financial necessity isn't there.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author truly supported her, he might encourage her to pursue her dream, even if it means she earns more. But the situation isn't that straightforward because he's already acknowledged that his feelings are based on his need to feel like the breadwinner. There's no coercion here; she's making the decision herself. The author isn't in the wrong for having those feelings, but maybe he should work on overcoming them. However, the question is about whether he's in the wrong, not whether he should change.\n\nSo, the answer hinges on whether having those feelings makes him wrong. Since he's being honest and not actively blocking her, perhaps he isn't in the wrong. But some might argue that it's wrong to prioritize his ego over her potential. But the user's initial thought is that the author isn't in the wrong, and I need to consider if that's accurate.\n"
