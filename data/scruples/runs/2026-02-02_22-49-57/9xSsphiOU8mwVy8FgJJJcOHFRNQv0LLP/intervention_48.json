I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA question is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him.\n\nFirst, the author's main concern is feeling emasculated if he makes less than his wife. He's the primary breadwinner, and he values that role. His wife might be going back to grad school, which her parents are funding, to switch careers for higher pay. He's worried about the shift in their financial dynamic, even though they don't need the extra money because he already earns enough for them both.\n\nNow, I need to consider societal norms and relationship dynamics. Traditionally, there's been a cultural expectation where the man is the main earner, but that's changing. The question is whether the author's feelings are valid or if he's in the wrong for prioritizing his ego over his wife's aspirations.\n\nThe wife is making a decision that could lead to personal growth and a career she's interested in. The author is against it not because of practical reasons (like financial necessity or her job satisfaction) but because of his own feelings about being the breadwinner. That seems self-centered. His argument is based on his own insecurities rather than what's best for his wife's happiness or their relationship.\n\nAlso, the wife is already working a job she loves, but she wants to pursue a different path. The author's support or lack thereof can affect their relationship. By not supporting her choice, he's prioritizing his own ego over her ambitions. Even if their financial situation is stable, the wife's right to pursue her dreams should be considered. The author's feelings of emasculation might be a personal issue he needs to address, rather than a reason to dissuade her from her goals.\n\nIn terms of AITA, the author is in the wrong because his opposition is based on his own insecurities rather than practical or supportive reasons. The wife's career choice is her own, and a healthy relationship should support each other's growth, even if it changes the financial dynamics.\n"
