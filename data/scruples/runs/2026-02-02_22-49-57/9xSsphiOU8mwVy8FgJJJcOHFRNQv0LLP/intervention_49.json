I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. The situation is pretty detailed. They're in their late 20s, he's the main breadwinner, she's working but makes less. They don't plan to have kids, so no financial pressure. She put her grad school on hold to support them financially, but now her parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which would lead to a higher salary than his.\n\nThe author is uncomfortable because he likes being the breadwinner and feels emasculated if she makes more. He doesn't support her pursuing this path even though she loves her current job but wants to follow her dream. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants an opinion.\n\nHmm. The key points here are about respect for each other's aspirations, financial independence, and self-worth. The author's concern is about his self-esteem tied to being the higher earner, which is a personal issue. But in a healthy relationship, supporting each other's growth is important. The wife has the opportunity to pursue her dreams, especially since they don't need the money. The fact that the author is not supporting her because of his ego might be problematic. Also, the wife's parents offering to pay removes financial barriers. The author's reasoning is based on his own feelings rather than objective reasons related to their well-being. So, I think the author is in the wrong because he's not supporting his wife's aspirations for personal reasons. Therefore, answer A.\n"
