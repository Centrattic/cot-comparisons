I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole?) post is in the wrong. The scenario involves the author not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical and social aspects here. The author's main issue is feeling emasculated if he's no longer the sole breadwinner. He mentions that they live comfortably on his salary, and he values the role of being the financial support. His wife, on the other hand, is considering a career change that she's passionate about, even though she's currently happy in her job. The parents are offering to fund her education, which removes the financial burden from the couple.\n\nNow, looking at the dynamics: the wife had put her grad school plans on hold to support the author during his studies. Now she's excited to pursue her dream, and he's resistant because of his own ego. This seems to be about his feelings rather than any practical concerns. He doesn't mention any issues with her current job, like lack of growth or dissatisfaction beyond her interest in a different field. \n\nIn terms of fairness, supporting a spouse's career is generally considered important in a healthy relationship. The fact that the wife is making a choice that's good for her, and the author is opposing it due to his own insecurities, points towards him being the one in the wrong. The wife's desire to pursue her goals, especially when financially supported by her parents, is a valid personal choice. The author's reasoning is based on his self-esteem rather than objective reasons, which is a common point of criticism in such situations.\n\nAlso, the author acknowledges that his feelings might be unpopular, but that doesn't necessarily make them right. In a relationship, respecting each other's ambitions is key. His resistance could hinder his wife's personal growth and happiness. Unless there are other factors not mentioned, like financial strain or the wife's unhappiness in her current job, the author's stance seems to be more about his ego than her well-being.\n\nSo, considering the above, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because his opposition is based on personal insecurities rather than valid reasons, and he should support his wife's career choices.\n"
