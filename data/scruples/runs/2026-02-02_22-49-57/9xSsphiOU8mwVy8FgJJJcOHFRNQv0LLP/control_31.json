I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to earn more than him. The situation involves the wife considering a graduate program that would lead to a higher salary. The husband's main issue is feeling emasculated if his wife makes more, even though they don't need the money.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband is the primary breadwinner, and the wife is currently working but making less. The husband acknowledges that he's uncomfortable with the idea of her making more, which is tied to his self-esteem. The wife's parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which is a significant opportunity. The husband's opposition is mainly about ego, not financial necessity.\n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, should a person's career choices be influenced by their partner's ego? Generally, individuals should support each other's ambitions. The husband's concern is about his own feelings rather than practical reasons like financial need or family responsibilities. Since they don't plan on having kids and already live comfortably, the financial aspect isn't a valid reason to discourage her. \n\nThe husband's initial reaction was to oppose her plans because of his own insecurities. Even though he softened a bit, the underlying issue is his discomfort with being the lower earner. This might be considered selfish because it prioritizes his ego over his wife's aspirations. Healthy relationships often require supporting each other's growth, regardless of traditional gender roles. The husband's stance could be seen as reinforcing outdated notions of masculinity, which might make him the \"asshole\" in the scenario.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the husband is being honest about his feelings. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since the wife's opportunity is a positive step for her, and the husband's objection is based on personal insecurities rather than valid reasons, it's likely that he's in the wrong. The answer would be A (Yes).\n"
