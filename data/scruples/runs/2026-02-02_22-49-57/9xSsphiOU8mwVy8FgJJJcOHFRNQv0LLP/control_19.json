I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation involves the husband not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points here. The husband makes enough for both of them to live comfortably. His wife is currently working but earns less than half of his salary. She's considering going back to grad school, which her wealthy parents are funding, to switch to a career that would surpass his earnings. The husband's main issue is that he feels emasculated by the idea of her making more than him, even though they don't need the extra money and have no kids.\n\nSo, the main question is whether his feelings are valid or if he's wrong to feel that way. Let's break it down. \n\nThe husband's reasons are about his own ego and feeling like the primary breadwinner. He acknowledges that this is an unpopular opinion but says it's because he feels \"good enough\" when he makes more. On the other hand, the wife has a chance to pursue her dream, which she's excited about, and the parents are offering to fund her education. \n\nIn terms of right or wrong, society often frowns upon traditional gender roles where a man feels the need to be the sole breadwinner. The wife's decision to pursue higher education and a better career is her personal choice, especially since they can afford it. The husband's reluctance seems to stem from insecurity rather than practical concerns like financial necessity. \n\nAlso, the wife already made a sacrifice by putting her grad school plans on hold to support him during his studies. Now she's considering her own path again. It's important for a healthy relationship that both partners support each other's aspirations unless there's a valid, mutual reason not to. Here, the husband's reason is purely about his own feelings of emasculation, not about the couple's well-being or practical issues. \n\nI should also consider if there's any cultural or societal context. In many modern relationships, both partners are expected to pursue their careers independently. The husband's stance might be seen as outdated or patriarchal. However, the user is asking if he's \"in the wrong,\" not just whether society would disapprove. \n\nAnother angle is communication. The husband did express his concerns but then backed off when she showed excitement. However, his underlying reason isn't communicated clearly, which might lead to resentment. The wife might feel unsupported in her ambitions, which could harm their relationship over time. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the husband's reasoning is based on personal insecurity rather than objective reasons. Supporting a partner's career growth is generally seen as important in a healthy relationship. Therefore, the author (the husband) might be in the wrong for not supporting his wife's decision, even if his feelings are genuine.\n"
