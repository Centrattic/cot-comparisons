I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person in the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the author not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him, even though he makes enough for both of them. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author's main issue is feeling emasculated if his wife earns more than him, even though they don't need the extra income. His wife had put her grad school plans on hold to support him during his studies, and now with her parents offering to cover the costs, she wants to go back. The author is concerned about being the breadwinner and doesn't want to feel less than if she makes more.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and equality in relationships. Modern relationships often emphasize equality and mutual support. The author's reasoning is based on his personal feelings about gender roles and self-esteem, which might be outdated. The wife's career choice is her own, especially since the financial need isn't a factor here. The author's resistance is more about his own ego than practical concerns.\n\nAlso, the wife's parents are financially supporting her, which removes the financial burden. The author's argument that he wants to be the breadwinner is a traditional view that might not align with contemporary values where both partners can pursue their ambitions regardless of income. The fact that they don't plan to have kids also means there's no added pressure for dual income.\n\nThe author's feelings are valid in that people can have insecurities, but the ethical question is whether it's right to prevent a partner from pursuing their dreams for the author's own ego. The answer usually leans towards supporting individual growth unless there are legitimate, mutual concerns. Here, the author's reasons are self-centered rather than practical.\n\nTherefore, the answer is likely that the author is in the wrong because he's prioritizing his ego over his wife's aspirations, even though there's no financial necessity. The wife's right to pursue her education and career, especially with parental support, should be respected regardless of the income comparison.\n"
