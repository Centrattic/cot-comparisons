I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario involves a husband who's uncomfortable with his wife pursuing a higher-paying career because he doesn't want to be the lower earner, even though they financially don't need it.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The husband is worried about feeling emasculated if his wife makes more. The wife is considering going back to school with her parents' support, which would lead to a higher salary. They don't have kids, so there's no financial pressure. The husband acknowledges his reasoning might be unpopular.\n\nThe user initially thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to consider societal norms, equality in relationships, and personal feelings. The husband's concern is about his self-esteem tied to being the breadwinner. But in modern contexts, relationships are often expected to be more about mutual support rather than traditional roles. The wife's desire to pursue her dream is a personal right. However, the husband's feelings are valid, though maybe problematic.\n\nThe question is whether it's wrong to feel that way. The answer depends on whether prioritizing one's ego over a partner's career aspirations is acceptable. Even if his feelings are genuine, supporting a partner's growth is typically seen as important. The husband's reasoning might be considered outdated or selfish, even if he's not malicious.\n\nSo, the answer might be A (author is in the wrong) because his reasoning is based on ego rather than supporting his wife's ambitions. However, it's a complex situation where both parties have valid feelings, but societal expectations often prioritize the partner's personal goals.\n"
