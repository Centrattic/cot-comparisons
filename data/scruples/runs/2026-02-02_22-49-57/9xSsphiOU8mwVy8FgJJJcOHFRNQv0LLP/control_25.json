I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The author is a husband who's uncomfortable with his wife pursuing a career that could make her earn more than him. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The wife already sacrificed her grad school plans to support the author during his master's. Now, her parents are offering to fund her grad school, which could lead to a higher salary. The author's main issue is feeling emasculated if he's not the primary earner, even though their current finances are comfortable.\n\nThe wife is pursuing her own dream, which she loves, and the author is blocking her because of his own ego. That seems problematic. Financial roles in a relationship shouldn't be about ego but mutual support. The author's argument that he's the breadwinner is a traditional view that doesn't consider equality. The fact that they don't plan to have kids doesn't negate her right to pursue her goals. Also, the author's admission that he'd feel emasculated is a red flag. Healthy relationships prioritize each other's growth over personal insecurities. So, the author is in the wrong here because he's hindering his wife's ambitions for his own sake.\n"
