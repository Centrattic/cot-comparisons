I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a person who doesn't want their wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than them. The wife already has a job she loves but is considering grad school, which would lead to higher pay. The author's main issue is feeling emasculated if their wife makes more.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. The author mentions they're both in their late 20s, have no kids, and live comfortably on his salary alone. The wife previously put her grad plans on hold to support the author. Now, her parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which she's excited about. The author is conflicted because he's used to being the sole breadwinner and feels it's important to him to be the higher earner.\n\nThe question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's break it down. The wife is pursuing a career she's interested in, which she loves. The author's opposition seems to stem from his own ego and feelings about being the breadwinner. The wife's parents are supporting her education, which could be a factor in her decision. Also, the author admits they don't need the extra money, so financial necessity isn't an issue here.\n\nFrom a relationship perspective, it's important for partners to support each other's goals and aspirations. If the wife wants to pursue her dream, even if it leads to higher earnings, the author's resistance could be seen as hindering her growth. The author's reasoning is based on personal insecurity rather than any objective reason related to the family's needs or the wife's happiness.\n\nHowever, the author is also being honest about their feelings. They're not trying to control their wife but are struggling with their own emotions. The key here is whether it's acceptable for someone's personal feelings to override a partner's career aspirations. In healthy relationships, partners should encourage each other's paths unless there's a compelling reason against it. Since there's no such reason here (no financial need, the wife is passionate, her parents are supporting her), the author's resistance seems to stem from a place of insecurity rather than mutual benefit.\n\nAlso, the wife's decision to pursue grad school might not affect the author's role as the breadwinner if they're already living comfortably. The author's concern about feeling emasculated is a personal issue that they might need to work on rather than imposing it on their partner. It's possible that the author is prioritizing their ego over their spouse's fulfillment.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author is being honest and the situation is complex, their reasoning for opposing their wife's career move is based on personal insecurities rather than valid concerns. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong for not supporting their wife's aspirations.\n"
