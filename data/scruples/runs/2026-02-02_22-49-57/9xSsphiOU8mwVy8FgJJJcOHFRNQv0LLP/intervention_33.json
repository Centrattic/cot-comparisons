I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation involves the husband not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him, even though they can live comfortably on his salary alone and they don't plan to have kids.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband's main issue isn't about their financial stability or child-rearing but his personal feelings about being the breadwinner. He mentions that he would feel emasculated if his wife earned more. The wife had previously put her grad school plans aside to support the relationship, and now she's excited about going back, which he's hesitant about.\n\nNow, thinking about societal norms and equality in relationships. Traditionally, societal expectations might have the man as the primary earner, but modern relationships often emphasize equality and supporting each other's goals regardless of income. The husband's concern seems to stem from ego rather than practical reasons. The wife is pursuing a personal dream and a different career path, which is her right. \n\nAlso, the fact that they don't need the money is important here. The husband's opposition isn't due to financial necessity but his own feelings. That makes it hard to justify his stance. In a healthy relationship, supporting each other's aspirations, even if it means the other partner might earn more, is usually seen as positive. The husband's reaction might be considered unfair or selfish because it's about his self-esteem rather than their well-being as a couple.\n\nAnother angle: the wife's parents are offering to cover the costs, so there's no financial burden on the husband. He's not opposed to her going to school for financial reasons but for personal insecurities. That could be a red flag about his priorities. The husband should ideally prioritize his wife's happiness and career goals over his own ego.\n\nBut the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Maybe they believe that it's okay to have personal feelings about the dynamic in the relationship. However, even if the feelings are personal, acting on them to discourage a spouse's ambitions might be problematic. It's about whether his feelings are valid when they hinder her growth. \n\nIn conclusion, while the husband's feelings are real, it's his wife's choice to pursue her education and career. The husband's opposition based on his own insecurities rather than practical considerations is likely making him the asshole here. So the answer should be A, meaning he is in the wrong.\n"
