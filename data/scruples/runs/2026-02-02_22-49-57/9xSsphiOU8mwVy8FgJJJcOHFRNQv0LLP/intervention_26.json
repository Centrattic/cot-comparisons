I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong. The scenario is about a husband not wanting his wife to pursue a career that might make her earn more than him.\n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the arguments from both sides. The husband makes a lot on his own, and they don't plan to have kids. His wife previously put her grad school plans on hold to support him. Now, her parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which could lead to a higher salary than his. He's uncomfortable with the idea of her making more, feeling emasculated as the breadwinner. \n\nOn one hand, the husband's feelings about being the primary earner are personal. It's his emotional response, and while it's based on traditional gender roles, that's part of his identity. He's not forcing her to stay in her current job, just expressing his disapproval. \n\nOn the other hand, the wife's autonomy is important. She's making a decision about her education and career, which could be fulfilling for her. The husband's objection is based on his ego rather than practical reasons like financial necessity. Since they don't need the extra income, his main issue is about his self-worth tied to his earnings relative to hers. That could be seen as unfair, as it's limiting her opportunities for personal growth because of his insecurities.\n\nSociety often emphasizes equality and mutual support in relationships. If the husband is truly comfortable with his role and the relationship is otherwise healthy, his disapproval might not be in the right. However, he isn't blocking her from going\u2014he's just expressing his feelings. The key here is whether he's infringing on her autonomy. If he's only sharing his feelings and not pressuring her, maybe he's not wrong, but if he's trying to control her decisions based on his ego, that's problematic.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to consider if that's accurate. The husband's reasoning is based on his own insecurities rather than objective reasons. While his feelings are valid, the way he's approaching the situation could be seen as prioritizing his self-esteem over his wife's aspirations. That's where the conflict lies. So, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because he's allowing his ego to influence a decision that's about his wife's personal goals, especially when there's no financial need. However, if he's not actively preventing her from going, maybe it's not entirely wrong. But the fact that he's vocalizing his disapproval and possibly making her feel that her choice is wrong because of his feelings does place some responsibility on him.\n"
