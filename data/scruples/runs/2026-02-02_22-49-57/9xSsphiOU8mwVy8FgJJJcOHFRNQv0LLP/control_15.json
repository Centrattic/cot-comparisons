I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author (the husband) is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The husband is making enough to support both of them comfortably. The wife currently works but earns less. They don't plan to have kids. Her parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which could lead to a higher salary than his. The husband is against it because he feels the need to be the primary breadwinner and would feel emasculated if she made more.\n\nFrom a fairness perspective, the husband's reasons are based on his own ego and traditional gender roles. The wife is following her dream, which she loves, and her parents are supporting her education financially. The husband's objection isn't about practical concerns like financial strain or her happiness, but about his own feelings of masculinity. That seems problematic.\n\nIn modern relationships, both partners are encouraged to pursue their own goals and careers without feeling restricted by the other's ego. The husband's stance might be considered outdated and self-centered. The wife's decision to pursue her dream, especially with financial support from her parents, is a personal choice that doesn't harm the husband's position. The husband's comfort with being the breadwinner shouldn't override her aspirations unless there's a mutual agreement based on shared goals. Since the wife is excited and the husband's objection is based on his insecurities, he's likely in the wrong here.\n"
