I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. The answer needs to be A or B. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author's wife is considering going to grad school, which would lead her to earn more than him. They don't have kids, and he's the primary breadwinner. He admits that his main issue is feeling emasculated if she makes more, even though they can live comfortably on his salary alone.\n\nIn terms of fairness, the wife previously sacrificed her grad school plans to support the author when he was in school. Now she's being offered the chance to pursue her own path, which she's excited about. The author's reluctance isn't just about practical concerns but about his ego. That might be a red flag in a relationship. \n\nSociety often expects men to be the primary earners, but that's a stereotype. The wife's career choice is her own right, and the author's feelings about it shouldn't dictate her decisions. The fact that he's not happy with the idea despite her enthusiasm suggests he might be prioritizing his own insecurities over her career aspirations. \n\nHowever, the author is honest about his feelings and hasn't outright opposed her. He's expressed concerns but hasn't blocked her. Still, his underlying reason is about ego, which could be problematic. \n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that he's not stopping her and is just sharing his feelings. But the core issue is whether it's right for him to feel the way he does. If his feelings make him in the wrong, then the answer would be A. If it's just a personal preference without causing harm, maybe B. \n\nBut the key here is that the wife's choice is valid, and his feelings shouldn't override hers. His reasoning is based on ego, not practicality, so he's in the wrong for letting that influence her decisions. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
