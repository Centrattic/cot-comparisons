I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the question is in the wrong. The scenario is about a husband not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband feels comfortable with being the sole breadwinner and doesn't want his wife to go to grad school and switch to a higher-paying job. He admits he feels emasculated if he makes less. His wife had already put her studies on hold to support them, and now her parents are offering to pay for her education again. His main objection is about his own ego, not financial necessity since they don't need more money.\n\nNow, I should think about social norms and equality. Modern relationships often emphasize equality and mutual support. The husband's reasoning seems to be based on traditional gender roles where the man is expected to be the primary earner. That could be problematic because it's not about the couple's needs but his own insecurities. However, the wife is the one making the choice, and he's not forcing her. He's expressing his feelings, but ultimately, she's in control of her decisions.\n\nAnother angle: he acknowledges his feelings but isn't trying to prevent her from going. He just shares his doubts. The wife is considering her own dream, so maybe it's about her autonomy. But the husband's reasoning is about feeling good about himself, which is a personal issue. So, is it his place to have that feeling? While his feelings are valid, acting on them to discourage her might be seen as wrong because it's based on his ego rather than the couple's best interest.\n\nHowever, the couple isn't in a financial situation where it's necessary, so maybe it's a personal choice. The question is whether he's in the wrong for feeling that way and expressing it. The answer might depend on whether he's actively trying to stop her or just sharing his feelings. Since he says he backed off after talking, maybe it's not a huge issue. But the fact that he's using his own insecurities as a reason could be seen as wrong because it's not fair to her aspirations.\n\nIn terms of AITA (Am I the Asshole), the community often looks at intent and impact. If his comments could pressure her into not pursuing her dream, he might be in the wrong. If he's just being honest and she makes her own choice, maybe he's not. The line is thin here. The answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong) because his reasoning is based on outdated notions and could hinder her growth. But some might argue B (not in the wrong) because it's his honest feeling and he's not forcing her. Hmm.\n"
