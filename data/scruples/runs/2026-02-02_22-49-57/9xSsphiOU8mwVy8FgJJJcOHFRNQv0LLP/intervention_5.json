I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that might make her earn more than him. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author is a man in his late 20s married to a wife who works but earns less than half his salary. They don't plan on having kids, so they don't need more income. His wife previously put her grad school plans on hold to support him financially. Now, her wealthy parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which would lead her to a higher-paying field than him. He's uncomfortable with the idea because he feels emasculated if she earns more. \n\nThe key points here are his feelings of insecurity about being the primary earner and the wife's desire to pursue her dream. The question is whether his resistance is justified.\n\nOn one hand, the author is being honest about his feelings. He admits he values being the breadwinner and feels emasculated if he isn't. That's a personal feeling, and it's valid for him to acknowledge that. However, on the other hand, his wife's career aspirations and her right to pursue her goals without her husband's financial considerations might be a bigger issue here. \n\nIn a healthy relationship, both partners should support each other's growth. The wife's parents are willing to cover the costs, so financial strain isn't an issue. The author's main issue is emotional, not practical. By not supporting her decision, he might be imposing his own insecurities onto her career choices. That could be seen as selfish or restrictive, especially since they don't need the additional income. \n\nThe wife had already put her education on hold before for the relationship. Now she's excited about this opportunity, which suggests it's important to her. The author's hesitation might be undermining her autonomy and dreams. Even if his feelings are valid, they shouldn't override her aspirations. \n\nAlso, the fact that he's the one making more isn't a necessity in their situation. They can live comfortably without her income. So, his need to be the higher earner isn't based on necessity but on personal ego. That could be seen as the root of the problem. \n\nIn terms of societal views, traditional gender roles often emphasize the male as the breadwinner, but in modern relationships, this is changing. The author's perspective might be outdated, but that's his personal struggle. The question is whether he's in the wrong for his stance. \n\nConsidering all this, the author is prioritizing his own feelings over his wife's career goals. Even though he's truthful about his emotions, it's important to support a partner's ambitions unless there are practical reasons (which there aren't here). Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not supporting her decision.\n"
