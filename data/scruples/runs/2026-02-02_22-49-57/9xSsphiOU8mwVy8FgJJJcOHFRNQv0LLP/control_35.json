I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the user (a husband) is concerned about his wife wanting to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. He's not against her going back to school per se, but he's uncomfortable with the idea of her making more money. The main points to consider are his reasons and how they affect their relationship.\n\nFirst, the husband's main issue seems to be about his ego and feeling emasculated if he's not the breadwinner. He mentions that he's the one supporting them financially, and it makes him feel good. He also says he doesn't think any guy can feel \"good enough\" if his partner makes more. That sounds like a traditional view of gender roles where the man is expected to be the primary earner. But in modern relationships, that's not necessarily the case. Many couples have both partners working, and it's common for one to earn more than the other regardless of gender.\n\nThe wife's parents are offering to pay for her grad school, so there's no financial burden on them. The wife is excited about this opportunity, which suggests it's important to her. The husband's hesitation is more about his own feelings rather than the practical aspects. He acknowledges that they don't need her to work for financial reasons since his salary is sufficient. But he's still uncomfortable with her moving up in a different career path that would surpass his earnings.\n\nAnother angle is the wife's personal growth and her dreams. The husband says she put her graduate plans on hold to support him when he was in school. Now she's considering this path again, which could be a step towards her own aspirations. By discouraging her, the husband might be limiting her opportunities based on his insecurities. That could be seen as selfish or not supporting her ambitions.\n\nHowever, the husband did express his concerns and backed off after the discussion. He didn't try to stop her, just shared his feelings. The question is whether his feelings are valid or if his opposition is misplaced. In a healthy relationship, supporting each other's goals is important, even if it means one partner earns more. The husband's discomfort is about his self-worth tied to his income, which is a personal issue rather than a justification to hinder his wife's progress.\n\nSo, considering all that, the husband's stance is based on traditional gender roles and personal insecurities, which don't provide a valid reason to prevent his wife from pursuing her education and career. Therefore, he's in the wrong because he's prioritizing his ego over his wife's aspirations and the potential benefits of her advancement. The answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
