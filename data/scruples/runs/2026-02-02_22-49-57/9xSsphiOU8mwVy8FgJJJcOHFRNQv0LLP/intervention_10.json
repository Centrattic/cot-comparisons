I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about the author not wanting his wife to pursue a higher-paying career. He's the primary breadwinner now, and he feels emasculated if she makes more than him. He acknowledges that his feelings are unpopular, but he's honest about it.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The couple doesn't plan to have kids, so the need for dual incomes isn't there. The wife's parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which would lead to her making more than him. The author's main issue is about ego and feeling like he's the provider. \n\nFrom a feminist perspective, supporting a partner's career is important. However, the author isn't preventing her from going; he's just expressing his personal feelings. He's not stopping her, just voicing his discomfort. But is that okay? If he supports her decision but feels uncomfortable, maybe that's his personal issue. However, if he's using his influence to dissuade her, that could be problematic.\n\nThe wife has already put her education on hold before to support him. Now she's considering this opportunity. The author's feelings about being the breadwinner might be a traditional view, but if he's not actively blocking her, maybe it's not the worst. However, his reasoning is based on his own ego, which could be seen as selfish.\n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. If he's open with her and she's making her own choice despite his feelings, then maybe he's not at fault. However, if his feelings are causing her to reconsider her goals, then he might be in the wrong for not fully supporting her. The key here is whether he's respecting her autonomy. Since he's not stopping her and she's aware of his feelings, perhaps he's not in the wrong. But the fact that he's asking for validation might indicate that he's aware his perspective is not widely accepted. \n\nAlternatively, the fact that his feelings are causing tension in the relationship could be an issue. But the question is about right or wrong. The author isn't violating any laws or moral standards necessarily, just expressing his personal feelings. However, in terms of healthy relationships, supporting each other's ambitions is important. Even if he feels uncomfortable, not supporting her could be seen as wrong. But if he's not actively preventing her, it's a gray area.\n\nIn conclusion, the answer might depend on cultural norms and relationship expectations. But given the information, the author is expressing his feelings honestly but his reasons are ego-based. However, since he's not blocking her and she's making her own decision, maybe he's not in the wrong. But I'm a bit conflicted here. If the question is about being in the wrong, perhaps the answer is A (he is in the wrong) because his feelings could hinder her aspirations, even if he's not stopping her. Or B (not in the wrong) because he's being honest and she's free to choose.\n"
