I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that the husband doesn't want his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. They don't have kids, he's the primary earner, and they live comfortably. The wife is offered grad school by her wealthy parents, which would lead to a higher salary.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The husband admits he feels emasculated if his wife makes more. That's a key point. But in modern relationships, it's generally considered okay for partners to have different careers and earnings. There's no inherent problem in the wife wanting to advance her career unless there are specific issues like financial strain or personal conflicts.\n\nAnother angle is the husband's reasoning. He's not against her education because of financial concerns but because of his own ego. The question is whether prioritizing his feelings over his wife's aspirations is wrong. The wife already put her education on hold to support them when he was in school, and now she's excited about this opportunity. Her parents are covering the costs, so there's no financial burden on the couple.\n\nThe husband's main argument is about being the breadwinner and feeling good about it. But in a healthy relationship, both partners' goals should be supported. The fact that he's more concerned about his self-esteem than her happiness or ambitions might indicate a problem. Also, since they don't need the extra income, his concern isn't about financial stability but about his own feelings. \n\nThere's also the aspect of gender roles. The husband's discomfort with his wife earning more might be tied to traditional gender norms, which many would argue are outdated. The wife's decision to pursue her dream is her right, and the husband's opposition based on ego could be seen as selfish.\n\nHowever, the husband did talk to her about the potential changes and backed off, even if he wasn't fully supportive. The wife still might proceed with her plans despite his reservations. The question is whether his lack of support is wrong. The answer likely leans towards \"Yes\" because he's prioritizing his own feelings over her aspirations, especially when there's no practical reason to oppose it. The wife's happiness and career growth are important, and the husband's insecurity is a personal issue that shouldn't hinder her choices.\n"
