I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong. The situation is about the author not wanting his wife to pursue a career that might make her earn more than him.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the details. The wife already works but makes less than half of what the author does. They don't plan to have kids, so there's no financial necessity. The wife put her grad school plans on hold when they were together, and now her parents are offering to pay for it. The author is against it mainly because he feels it would make him feel emasculated if she earns more.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about personal feelings versus the wife's aspirations. The author's reasoning is based on his own ego and societal norms. But in modern relationships, it's more about mutual support and personal growth, not about traditional gender roles. The author's concern about being a breadwinner seems outdated and could be seen as controlling. The wife has the right to pursue her dreams and further her education, especially since the financial burden isn't on her. The fact that she's excited about the opportunity and the parents are covering the costs makes it even more about her personal goals. The author might be projecting his insecurities onto the situation. So, I think the answer is A because he's in the wrong for prioritizing his ego over his wife's ambitions.\n"
