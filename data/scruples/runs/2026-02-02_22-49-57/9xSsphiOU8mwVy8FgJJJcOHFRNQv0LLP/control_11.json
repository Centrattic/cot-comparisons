I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a higher-paying career that would surpass his income. \n\nFirst, the situation: The husband makes enough for them to live comfortably without kids. The wife is offered the chance to go back to grad school, funded by her wealthy parents, which would lead her to earn more than him. The husband's main issue is feeling emasculated if he's not the higher earner, even though they don't need the extra money.\n\nHmm, the key points here are about personal feelings versus the wife's aspirations. The husband's reason is rooted in his own insecurities about being the \"breadwinner\" and his self-worth tied to that role. But is it fair for him to influence her career choices based on his ego?\n\nFrom a modern perspective, many would argue that each partner should support the other's goals regardless of income. The wife's desire to pursue her dream, especially when financially supported by her parents, seems valid. The husband's hesitation is more about his own feelings than practical necessity. Also, they don't need the money, so it's not a financial survival issue but a personal aspiration.\n\nBut maybe there are other factors. The wife had already put her grad plans on hold earlier, which the husband acknowledges. Now she's excited again. Does he have a right to feel conflicted? However, his main argument is about his feelings of emasculation, which is a personal issue rather than a shared concern for their family's well-being. \n\nIn relationships, supporting each other's growth is usually encouraged. If he's not in a position to support her decision because of his own ego, that could be seen as selfish. The fact that they can afford her education and don't need her income adds to that. \n\nSo, the answer is likely A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because his opposition is based on his own insecurities rather than practical reasons, and a healthy relationship should support each other's aspirations regardless of income dynamics.\n"
