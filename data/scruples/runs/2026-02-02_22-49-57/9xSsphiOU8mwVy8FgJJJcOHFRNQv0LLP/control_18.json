I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong. The situation is about the man not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him, even though they can live comfortably on his salary alone. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points. The man is in his late 20s, his wife makes less than half of his salary. They don't plan to have kids. The wife's parents offered to fund her grad school, which could lead to a higher salary than him. He's uncomfortable with her making more, feeling emasculated. He admitted to feeling that way, which is a key point.\n\nThe question is whether he's wrong. From a traditional perspective, some might say it's okay for a person to feel that way, but others might argue that it's wrong to prioritize ego over his wife's aspirations. The wife was putting her plans on hold before to support him during his master's, which he acknowledges. Now she's pursuing her own path, which he's resisting due to personal feelings.\n\nIn modern contexts, equality in relationships is often emphasized. The fact that they can afford her education and that she's pursuing her dream might be seen as something he should support. However, he's being honest about his feelings. The issue is whether his feelings justify hindering her career goals.\n\nThe wife's parents' motivation (embarrassment) might also play a role, but the core issue is the husband's insecurity. The man's reasoning is based on his own emotional needs rather than practical concerns. Even though they don't need the money, his stance could be seen as selfish or traditional.\n\nIn terms of right and wrong, the husband's actions\u2014discouraging his wife from a path she's passionate about\u2014could be considered wrong because it's about his ego rather than their financial needs. Relationships are supposed to support each other's growth. His answer might not be malicious, but the priority on his self-image over her aspirations is problematic.\n\nSo, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong) because he's letting his insecurities affect his wife's career choices when there's no financial necessity. Supporting each other's ambitions is key in a healthy relationship, and his reasons are rooted in personal feelings rather than objective needs.\n"
