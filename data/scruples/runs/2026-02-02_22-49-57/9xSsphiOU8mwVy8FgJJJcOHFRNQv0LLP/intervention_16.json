I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. The answer options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The husband makes enough for both of them, they don't plan to have kids, and his wife is considering going back to grad school, which would lead to a higher salary. The husband's main issue is feeling emasculated if his wife earns more. \n\nFrom a feminist or modern perspective, it's often taught that both partners should support each other's career goals regardless of income. So the husband's hesitation might be seen as traditional gender roles affecting his feelings. However, the wife is making a choice based on her own interests, and the husband is expressing his discomfort. \n\nThe husband's reasoning is that he feels good being the breadwinner. That's a personal feeling, but the question is whether it's wrong to hold that view. If he's being manipulative or discouraging her out of financial necessity, maybe he's in the wrong. But since they can live comfortably even if he makes less, the financial pressure isn't there. \n\nHowever, the wife's parents are offering to cover the tuition, which removes financial barriers. The husband's main issue is his own ego, not practical concerns. In a healthy relationship, supporting each other's ambitions is key. If he's not supporting her because he's worried about his self-worth tied to income, that's a problem. \n\nBut the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. Maybe because the husband isn't outright forbidding her or being abusive, just expressing his feelings. However, the real question is whether his reasons are valid. If the wife is making a choice that's right for her, the husband's feelings shouldn't override that. \n\nSo, while the husband's feelings are real, it's his responsibility to work through them. Wanting to maintain the status quo for his ego, especially when it's not necessary for their financial stability, could be seen as wrong. So the answer might be A (he's in the wrong). But some might argue B because he's not acting out or being controlling. \n\nIn many modern perspectives, it's considered wrong to let traditional roles dictate your support for a partner's career. Therefore, the husband's stance might be viewed as incorrect, making the answer A. However, if the wife chooses to go despite his feelings, it's her decision. The husband isn't stopping her, just expressing his discomfort. So maybe he's not in the wrong. \n\nBut the core issue is that his reason for not supporting her is based on his ego, which is problematic. In a partnership, both should support each other's growth. So the answer might lean towards A. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong, not whether his feelings are valid. If the wife decides to go, it's her choice, and the husband's feelings are his problem to resolve. So he might not be in the wrong for expressing his feelings, but in a progressive context, his reasoning is flawed, making him in the wrong. \n\nHmm, this is a tough one. The answer could go either way depending on cultural or personal views. But in terms of modern relationship advice, supporting each other's ambitions regardless of income is the norm. Therefore, the husband's reasoning is based on outdated gender roles, making him in the wrong. So the answer is A.\n"
