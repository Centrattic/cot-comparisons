I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. The situation is a bit complex. The husband makes a good salary, they don't plan on having kids, and the wife is considering going to grad school with her parents' financial support. The real issue seems to be the husband's feelings about being the breadwinner and his possible emasculating emotions if she earns more.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of their relationship. The husband admits his main reason is feeling emasculated. That's a personal feeling, but it's important to evaluate if that's a valid reason to discourage his wife from her goals. The wife has already put her grad school plans on hold to support them when he was in school. Now she's excited about pursuing her dream with her parents' help. Her parents might be pushing her for various reasons, maybe their own pride, but that's not the husband's fault. \n\nThe husband's argument is that they don't need the extra income, so financially it's not a necessity. However, the wife's desire for personal growth and pursuing a different career path is her own. The husband's feelings about being the primary earner are his own insecurity. It's important to note that in a healthy relationship, both partners should support each other's ambitions unless there are valid, shared concerns. Here, the husband's concern isn't about their financial stability but his self-esteem. That's a personal issue he needs to address, not a reason to hold his wife back from her aspirations.\n\nAnother angle is whether the husband has communicated his feelings constructively. He expressed his thoughts but didn't outright oppose her decision. However, his underlying reasons are based on his own ego rather than rational financial or practical concerns. The wife's career choice is her right, and the husband shouldn't impose his insecurities on her. \n\nAdditionally, the fact that her parents are offering to cover her expenses means it's not a financial burden on the couple. So there's no real conflict in terms of money; it's purely about the husband's emotional response. In that case, the husband is prioritizing his own feelings over his wife's personal growth, which is a red flag in a partnership. \n\nTherefore, the husband is in the wrong because his reasons for not supporting his wife are based on insecurity rather than valid concerns. A healthy relationship should encourage each other's goals regardless of financial implications. The answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
