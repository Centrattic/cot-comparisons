I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author of the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation involves the husband not wanting his wife to pursue a career that could earn her more than him, even though they can live comfortably on his income.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the motivations. The husband mentions feeling emasculated if he makes less than his wife. He also points out that they don't plan on having kids, so there's no financial necessity. The wife had postponed her grad school plans to support him when he was getting his master's, and now her parents are offering to fund her education again.\n\nKey points: The husband's primary issue is his self-worth tied to being the breadwinner. The wife has a chance to pursue a passion and a higher salary. They have financial stability. The husband's resistance seems more about ego than financial need.\n\nEthically, controlling a partner's career choices based on ego is problematic. The wife has autonomy over her decisions. The husband's stance might be considered outdated or misogynistic, as it's not fair to prioritize his feelings over her aspirations. However, the husband is honest about his feelings, which is commendable. The wife had previously chosen to step back from grad school, but now has an opportunity. The husband's reluctance isn't out of financial concern but personal insecurity. This could be seen as being in the wrong because it's about his self-image rather than practical reasons.\n\nSo, the answer is likely A (the author is in the wrong). His opposition is based on his own insecurities rather than objective reasons, which undermines his wife's autonomy and potential.\n"
