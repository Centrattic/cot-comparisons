I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The scenario involves the husband not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him.\n\nFirst, the husband's reasoning is based on feeling emasculated if his wife makes more. He also mentions that he's the breadwinner and it makes him feel good. The wife had previously put her grad school plans on hold to support them financially, and now she's considering going back, supported by her wealthy parents. \n\nThe key points here are the husband's insecurity about being the primary earner and his comfort with the current financial setup. The wife, on the other hand, wants to pursue her dream, even though she loves her current job. The husband's opposition isn't about practical reasons like financial necessity or the wife's happiness but about his own ego. \n\nIn relationships, it's important that both partners support each other's goals and dreams. The husband's main issue isn't the wife's success but his own feelings about status. This could lead to resentment if not addressed. The wife's parents are offering financial support, so the cost isn't a barrier. The husband's stance might hinder her personal growth and career aspirations. \n\nHowever, the husband isn't directly preventing her; he's expressed his concerns. The question is whether his reasoning justifies his opposition. Since his concerns are based on his own self-esteem rather than her well-being or the couple's financial needs, it's more about his personal feelings. \n\nIn modern relationships, equality and mutual support are often emphasized. The husband's desire to be the breadwinner might be outdated or rooted in traditional gender roles. The wife's right to pursue her career shouldn't be contingent on the other's feelings. Therefore, the husband's position is problematic because it prioritizes his ego over his wife's ambitions. \n\nSo, the answer would be that the author is in the wrong (A) because his reasoning is based on insecurity rather than supporting his wife's aspirations.\n"
