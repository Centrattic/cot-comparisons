I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the question is whether it's okay for him to not want his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him.\n\nFirst, looking at the situation: The wife already works, but makes less than half of what the husband does. They don't plan on having kids, so there's no financial necessity for her to increase her earnings. The husband values being the sole breadwinner, and it makes him feel emasculated if she makes more. The wife has the opportunity to go back to grad school, paid by her wealthy parents, which could lead her to earn more than him. He's against it because of his own ego, not financial reasons.\n\nNow, the key points here. The husband is admitting that his main issue is his own insecurities about being the breadwinner, even though they don't need more money. He acknowledges that it's an unpopular opinion. The wife, on the other hand, wants to pursue her dream, which she's passionate about, even though she loves her current job. She's considering this path despite the husband's reservations.\n\nIn terms of fairness and respect in a relationship, it's generally considered healthy for each partner to support the other's personal growth and career aspirations. The husband's opposition is based on his own emotional needs rather than practical considerations. This could be seen as controlling or not respecting her autonomy. Even if he's not happy about the situation, his priority should be her happiness and her right to make her own decisions, especially since they have financial stability.\n\nAlso, the fact that they have enough money means that her pursuing higher education doesn't create a financial burden. The husband's feelings about being the breadwinner are personal, but they shouldn't override her career goals. Supporting each other's aspirations is a fundamental aspect of a healthy partnership.\n\nHowever, there's a nuance here. The husband did support her when she chose to work full-time to support them. Now, he's concerned because the new opportunity might shift the financial dynamic. But the difference here is that the previous choice was to support the relationship, while now it's about her personal growth. His resistance might stem from insecurity rather than genuine concern for her well-being.\n\nSo, considering all that, it seems like the author is in the wrong because his objections are based on his own ego rather than her best interests. He's not respecting her autonomy and aspirations, which is a significant issue in a relationship. The right approach would be for him to support her decision, even if it makes him uncomfortable, because her happiness and growth are more important than his need to feel emasculated.\n"
