I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and his wife are in their late 20s. He's the main breadwinner, and she works but makes less than half his salary. They don't plan on having kids. Her parents offered to pay for her grad school, which would lead her to a higher salary than him. She wants to go back for a different career path she's interested in, even though she loves her current job. The author is against it because he feels emasculated if she makes more than him, even though they can live comfortably on his income.\n\nThe key points here are the author's reasons. He's not opposed to her career growth per se, but he's worried about his self-esteem and traditional gender roles. He mentions feeling emasculated, which is a classic sign of internalized gender norms. The fact that they don't need the money for practical reasons (no kids, already comfortable) makes his resistance seem more about ego than necessity.\n\nIn terms of right or wrong, the author is making a decision based on his own insecurities rather than his wife's aspirations. The wife is considering this for her own dreams, even though she loves her current job. The author's opposition isn't about her happiness or the financial stability of the household but about his own feelings of being the breadwinner. That seems self-centered. In a healthy relationship, supporting each other's goals is important, even if it means personal adjustments. The author's feelings are valid, but they shouldn't override his wife's desires unless there's a compelling reason. Since there isn't a financial need, it's more about his ego. So the author is likely in the wrong.\n"
