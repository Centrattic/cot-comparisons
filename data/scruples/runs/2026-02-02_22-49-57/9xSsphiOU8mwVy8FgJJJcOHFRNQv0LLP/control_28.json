I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author's main reasons are that he's the primary breadwinner and feels emasculated if he makes less. He mentions they don't need more money, and his wife's parents are paying for her grad school. The wife put her plans on hold before to support him, and now she's excited to go back. The author is uncomfortable with the idea of her earning more.\n\nHmm, from a modern perspective, supporting a partner's career goals is usually seen as positive. The fact that the author is focused on being the breadwinner and feeling emasculated if he isn't might be a red flag. It's about ego or traditional gender roles. Also, his wife's happiness and career aspirations are important. She's not just switching for money but for her dream. The author's hesitation isn't about practical concerns (they don't need the money), but his own feelings. \n\nIn terms of fairness, the wife is being offered an opportunity to pursue her education and career, which could be fulfilling for her. The author's objection seems more about his self-esteem than their financial situation. It's also worth considering that the wife had already postponed her plans before, so now she's taking this step for herself. The author's stance could be seen as dismissive of her goals. \n\nBut maybe there's nuance. The author did consider her job satisfaction and the change in career path, so he's not entirely against it. However, the underlying reason is his own insecurities. In a healthy relationship, both partners should support each other's growth. So, the answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong because his objection is based on ego rather than practical reasons, and it's important to support a spouse's personal ambitions.\n"
