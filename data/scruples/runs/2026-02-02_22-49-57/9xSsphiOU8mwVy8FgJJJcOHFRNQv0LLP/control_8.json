I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for not wanting their wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than them.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the relationship. The husband is the primary breadwinner, and the wife currently makes less. The wife's parents are offering full tuition for her graduate program, which would lead to a higher salary. The husband's main concern is feeling emasculated if he makes less than her. \n\nThe question is whether his reasons justify being in the wrong. The problem here is that his objection is based on his ego rather than practical reasons like financial necessity or the wife's happiness. The wife is considering this because she loves the field and has a passion for it, even though she currently enjoys her job. \n\nIn modern relationships, supporting a partner's career growth is generally seen as important. The husband's reluctance stems from his own insecurities about being the breadwinner, which isn't a valid reason to discourage his wife from pursuing her goals. This could lead to resentment and harm the relationship in the long run. \n\nAdditionally, the couple doesn't have kids and can live comfortably on his salary, so there's no financial pressure. The wife's opportunity is a positive step for her, and the husband's feelings shouldn't override her aspirations. \n\nTherefore, the author is in the wrong because his reasons are self-centered and not aligned with supporting his wife's ambitions. The answer should be A.\n"
