I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author (who is a man in a relationship) is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. \n\nFirst, the main issue here is about the author's feelings of emasculation if his wife earns more. He makes it clear that he's the primary breadwinner and that this makes him feel good. The wife has an opportunity to go to grad school, funded by her wealthy parents, which would lead her into a higher-paying field. She's excited about this, even though it's a different path from her current job.\n\nThe author's reasoning is rooted in his own ego. He admits that he's not concerned about financial necessity since they live comfortably without kids. The problem isn't financial security but his discomfort with being the lower earner. This seems to be more about his personal insecurities rather than any actual harm to the relationship or his wife's happiness.\n\nIn a healthy relationship, supporting each other's career goals is important. The wife is pursuing her dream, which she's passionate about, and the author is resisting it because of his own feelings. Even though he says he backed off, the fact remains that he's not supportive of her decision. The wife's parents are offering financial support, which reduces the financial burden on the couple, making the decision more about her aspirations rather than practicality.\n\nSociety often has outdated gender roles that tie masculinity to being the sole or higher earner, but this is changing. The author's perspective might reflect these outdated views. The wife's choice to further her education and career should be supported unless there's a valid, mutual reason to consider otherwise. Since the couple doesn't need the extra income, his resistance is more about his personal feelings than practical considerations.\n\nSo, the author's stance is based on his ego and traditional gender roles rather than the well-being of his wife or the relationship. Therefore, he's in the wrong for not supporting her decision to pursue her goals.\n"
