I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author (AITA) is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. \n\nFirst, the author's main reason is feeling emasculated if he makes less. That's a key point. He mentions they live comfortably on his salary, so financially, there's no necessity. But his emotional response is about self-esteem tied to being the breadwinner. \n\nHe acknowledges that his wife put her education on hold to support them, which shows he's aware of past sacrifices. However, he's now resisting her current decision to pursue a higher salary, despite her love for her current job and a different career path. \n\nThe wife's parents are funding her education, so there's no financial burden on the couple. The author's objection seems rooted in personal insecurity rather than practical reasons. \n\nSocietally, it's becoming more accepted that both partners can earn different amounts without affecting their relationship. The author's feeling of being \"emasculated\" might be a traditional view that's outdated. Also, the wife's right to pursue her dream and career should be respected. \n\nHowever, the author is being honest about his feelings, and it's not that he's stopping her out of selfishness but because of his own emotions. But the fact that he's the one making more isn't a valid reason to deny her aspirations. \n\nSo, the core issue is whether his feelings about being the breadwinner override his wife's personal goals. Since the wife is choosing a path she's excited about, and there's no financial need, the author's stance is more about his insecurity. \n\nIn relationships, supporting each other's growth is important. The author isn't in the right because he's prioritizing his ego over his wife's desires. The answer should be A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
