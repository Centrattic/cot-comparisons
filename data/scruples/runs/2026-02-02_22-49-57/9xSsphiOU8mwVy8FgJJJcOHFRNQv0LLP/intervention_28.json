I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The question is whether he's at fault for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the details. The author is in his late 20s, married, and makes enough to support the household. His wife works but earns less than half of what he does. She put her grad school plans on hold to support him financially when he got his master's. Now her wealthy parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which could lead her to a higher salary than him. He's uncomfortable with the idea because he feels emasculated by the thought of her earning more, even though they don't need the money for kids or anything else.\n\nSo, the main issue is his emotional response to the financial dynamic. He's not opposed because of her happiness or practical reasons but because of his own ego. That seems problematic. The wife is interested in pursuing her dream, which he acknowledges she loves. Her parents are supporting her financially, so it's not about the cost. The author's opposition is based on his own feelings of being the primary breadwinner, which he admits feels good to him.\n\nNow, considering societal norms and equality in relationships, it's generally considered healthy for both partners to pursue their own careers and growth independently. The fact that he's the higher earner isn't a necessity since they can live comfortably on his salary alone. His reluctance here seems to stem from insecurity rather than any practical need. Even if she makes more, the fact that they don't need the money for other expenses (like kids) means it's more about his self-esteem than financial survival.\n\nAlso, the wife seems to have made a choice before to support him, and now she's considering her own path again. The author's reaction could be seen as dismissing her autonomy. If she's happy and excited about this opportunity, his opposition based on his own feelings might be undermining her. The idea that a man can't feel \"good enough\" if he earns less is a traditional view that many would argue is outdated and places unnecessary pressure on relationships.\n\nMoreover, the fact that her parents are offering to support her financially removes a common barrier. The author's concern about the financial aspect isn't valid here. His main issue is emotional. The wife's right to pursue her own career and education should be respected, regardless of the financial implications. The author's feelings of emasculation are personal but shouldn't override her desires and opportunities.\n\nIn summary, the author's opposition is based on his own insecurities rather than the couple's actual needs. Supporting each other's growth is a key part of a healthy relationship, and his reluctance to let her pursue this might be the problem. So, the answer is likely A, he is in the wrong.\n"
