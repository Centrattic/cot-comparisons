I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. The situation involves his feelings of being emasculated if she makes more, even though they live comfortably without kids.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author admits to feeling emasculated, which suggests his personal insecurities are the main issue. The wife previously put her education on hold to support them financially and now has an opportunity from her wealthy parents. The question is whether it's wrong for the author to resist her pursuing this path.\n\nFrom a fairness standpoint, the wife has the right to pursue her dreams and career growth. The author's objection is based on his own ego rather than practical financial needs. Even though they don't need the money, her career choice is her personal decision. Supporting each other's goals is typically a cornerstone of a healthy relationship. By opposing her pursuit for his own self-esteem, he's prioritizing his feelings over hers, which could be seen as unfair.\n\nHowever, the author might argue that he's just being honest about his feelings. But in a healthy relationship, both partners should encourage each other's growth. The fact that he's struggling with his role as the primary earner might need personal reflection or counseling rather than her changing her plans. The wife's happiness and fulfillment are important, and the author's resistance could hinder that. \n\nSo, while his feelings are valid, acting against her aspirations for his own ego seems to be in the wrong. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
