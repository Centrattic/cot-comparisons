I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out whether the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a man who's uncomfortable with his wife pursuing a graduate degree that would make her earn more than him. He's the main breadwinner, and he feels emasculated at the thought of her making more. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The author's wife is considering a career change, which she's passionate about. Her parents are offering to pay for her education, so there's no financial burden on the couple. The author's main issue is emotional\u2014his self-esteem is tied to being the higher earner. He mentions they don't plan to have kids, so there's no need for increased income for that reason. \n\nThe user says the author isn't in the wrong, but others might see it differently. Let's break down both sides. On one hand, the author is being honest about his feelings. He's not preventing her from going, just expressing his discomfort. He acknowledges that his feelings are unpopular but real. On the other hand, supporting a partner's career goals is important. The wife's desire to pursue her dream might be valid, and the husband's hesitation could be seen as prioritizing his ego over her aspirations.\n\nBut there's also the aspect of financial stability. The author states they live comfortably on his income alone, so practical concerns aren't the issue. The problem is purely emotional. In a healthy relationship, partners should support each other's growth, even if it affects their personal dynamics. If the author's feelings are causing tension, it's something they need to address, but does that make him wrong?\n\nSome might argue that feeling emasculated is a personal issue that he should work on, regardless of the wife's decision. Others might say he's being honest and that the wife can decide for herself whether to pursue it despite his feelings. The question is whether his stance is wrong. If he's allowing his insecurities to influence her choices, that's a problem. But if he's just expressing his feelings without trying to stop her, maybe he's not in the wrong.\n\nThe answer hinges on whether his feelings justify him being in the wrong. If he's not actively preventing her from going but is expressing his discomfort, maybe he's not at fault. However, the fact that he's the one bringing this up in a forum like AITA suggests he might not fully support her decision. The line between expressing feelings and being in the wrong is blurry. \n\nIn conclusion, while his feelings are valid, the core issue is whether he's in the wrong for not wanting her to pursue a better career. The answer might be B (No) because he's not stopping her, just expressing his feelings. But others might see it as A because he's letting his ego affect her autonomy. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong, and given that he's not actively blocking her, maybe B is correct.\n"
