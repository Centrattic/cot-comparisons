I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is at fault (AITA) for not wanting his wife to pursue a higher-paying career. Let me break down the situation.\n\nFirst, the husband makes enough for both of them to live comfortably. His wife currently earns less than half his salary. They don't plan to have kids, so financial pressure isn't an issue. The wife put her grad school plans on hold to support the relationship financially when he was in school. Now, her wealthy parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which would lead her to a higher salary than him. The husband is against this because he feels emasculated if he's not the primary earner.\n\nThe husband's main issue seems to be about ego and self-worth tied to being the breadwinner. He even acknowledges that he finds comfort in supporting them financially. However, the wife is excited about a new opportunity she's passionate about, which is different from her current job.\n\nI need to consider if his reasoning is valid. On one hand, he's being honest about his feelings, which is important in a relationship. On the other hand, his opposition is based on personal insecurity rather than practical reasons like financial necessity or the wife's well-being. The wife is making a career choice that's important to her, and the husband is trying to influence it for his own emotional reasons. That might not be fair.\n\nIn a healthy relationship, both partners should support each other's goals and growth. The husband's reluctance could hinder his wife's personal development. Also, their financial situation is stable, so her higher earning potential isn't causing any hardship. The husband's feelings about being the breadwinner are his own, but they shouldn't dictate the wife's career choices. The fact that he's comparing salaries and feeling emasculated might indicate underlying issues about self-worth and equality in the relationship.\n\nSo, even though he's being honest, his reasoning is problematic. The wife's career is her own decision, and the husband's opposition based on ego isn't a valid reason to discourage her. Therefore, the author might be in the wrong for not supporting his wife's aspirations and letting his insecurities affect their relationship dynamics.\n"
