I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a higher-paying career. The situation involves the wife's potential to make more than him, and the husband's feelings about being the breadwinner.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the key points. The husband is in his late 20s, making enough for both of them to live comfortably. The wife currently earns less than half of his salary. She previously put her education on hold to work full-time, which he supported. Now, her wealthy parents are offering to cover her graduate school costs, leading her to pursue a different career path that could surpass his earnings.\n\nThe husband's main reason is feeling emasculated if she makes more. He acknowledges this is unpopular but feels it's about his ego. The wife loves her current job but wants to chase her dream. They don't plan to have kids, so financial necessity isn't the driver here.\n\nNow, evaluating if he's in the wrong. From a modern perspective, supporting a partner's career choices is often seen as important for equality and personal growth. The husband's objection seems rooted in his self-esteem rather than practical concerns. However, he's upfront about his feelings and hasn't pressured her. The wife is making the choice, and while he's not thrilled, he's allowing her to pursue it.\n\nOn the other hand, his reasoning is based on traditional gender roles and personal insecurity, which can be problematic. But he's not actively hindering her; he's just expressing discomfort. The question is whether his feelings justify being in the wrong. Since he's not blocking her and is honest, maybe it's more about his personal growth rather than being wrong. However, the expectation that he should be okay with her making more is valid. So, the answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong) because his stance is based on harmful gender stereotypes, but there's nuance in that he's not preventing her from pursuing it.\n"
