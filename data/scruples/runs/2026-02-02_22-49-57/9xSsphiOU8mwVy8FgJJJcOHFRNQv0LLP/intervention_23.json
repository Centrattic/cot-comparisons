I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again.\n\nThe author is a guy who doesn't want his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. His wife is currently working a job she loves but makes less than half of his salary. They don't plan on having kids, so there's no financial pressure. The wife didn't go to grad school earlier to support him when he was getting his master's. Now her parents are offering to pay for her grad school, which would put her on a path to a higher salary than him. The author feels emasculated at the thought of her making more and is unsure if she should take the opportunity.\n\nHmm. The question is whether he's in the wrong. Let me break it down. The main issue seems to be his insecurity about not being the higher earner. He mentions feeling emasculated and that he likes being the breadwinner. But is that a valid reason to discourage his wife from pursuing something she wants, especially if it's her dream? \n\nFinancial independence is important for individuals, and supporting each other's career goals is typically seen as a healthy part of a relationship. The wife's parents are offering to cover the costs, so there's no financial burden on the couple. The author is okay with her working, but now he's against a path that would make her higher earning. That seems contradictory. If he truly supported her, he should encourage her to follow her dreams, even if it means she earns more. \n\nAlso, the fact that he's focused on his own feelings of emasculation rather than her aspirations might indicate a lack of support. Relationships are about mutual respect and encouragement, not about one person's ego. Even though they can live comfortably on his income, her career growth is her own right. It's not about financial need but about her personal fulfillment and goals.\n\nBut wait, the author does mention that he's not against her going to grad school if it were different, but because it would lead to her making more than him, he's against it. That seems to prioritize his own feelings over her wishes. That could be a problem. The wife is making a decision based on her own interests, and the husband is opposing it for his insecurity. That's a red flag. \n\nOn the other hand, the author might be struggling with his self-worth being tied to his salary. That's a personal issue he needs to work on. The fact that he's asking if he's the asshole suggests he's aware his feelings might not be justified. But the question is whether he's in the wrong. Since he's discouraging his wife's pursuit of a dream because of his own ego, I think that's where he's wrong. Relationships should support each other's growth, regardless of financial status. \n\nSo the answer is A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
