I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so the user is asking if the author of the given story is in the wrong. Let me start by reading through the situation carefully.\n\nThe author is a husband who's questioning whether it's wrong that he doesn't want his wife to pursue a higher-paying career, which would make her earn more than him. They're in their late 20s, have no plans for kids, and he currently supports them financially. His wife had put graduate school on hold to work and support them, and now her wealthy parents are offering to pay for her grad school again. She's excited about it, but the author is concerned because he feels emasculated at the thought of her making more. The main issue seems to be his emotional reaction based on his ego rather than practical reasons.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion. The options are A (yes, he's in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. The wife is considering a path she's passionate about, which could be her dream. The husband's main objection is based on his own feelings of being emasculated, not on financial necessity or her happiness. That seems problematic because it's about his ego rather than her well-being. In a healthy relationship, supporting each other's aspirations is important. The husband's stance might be seen as self-centered.\n\nHowever, there are some nuances. They have a comfortable financial situation, so the practical need isn't there. The wife had previously put her studies on hold, and the husband thought she wasn't interested anymore. Now she's excited again, which might indicate a genuine desire for growth. The husband's reaction could stem from insecurity, which isn't a valid reason to dissuade her.\n\nOn the other hand, the husband isn't outright blocking her. He expressed his concerns but allowed her to make the decision. The question is whether his feelings justify being in the wrong. If the wife's happiness and career growth are more important, then the husband's objection is misplaced. However, if relationships have mutual considerations, maybe his feelings are part of the equation.\n\nAnother angle: the husband's reasoning is based on traditional gender roles where the man is the primary earner. That's a societal norm that many people challenge today. The author's reasoning might be outdated, leading to the conclusion that he's in the wrong by not supporting her ambitions regardless of personal feelings.\n\nIn summary, the author's main issue is his own ego and traditional views, which could hinder his wife's personal growth. Ethically, supporting a partner's career is usually expected unless there's a valid reason. The correct answer here leans towards A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
