I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me start by reading through the situation again to make sure I understand all the details.\n\nThe author is a guy in his late 20s who is married. His wife also works but makes less than half of what he does. They don't plan to have kids, so there's no financial pressure for her to earn more. The wife had put her graduate school plans on hold when they were dating so that she could support them financially while he was in his master's program. Now, her wealthy parents are offering to pay for her graduate education, which would lead to a higher salary than his current one. The author is against this because he feels it would make him feel emasculated if she made more money than him. He's not sure if he's in the wrong (AITA).\n\nFirst, I should consider the main points here. The author's concern is about his ego\u2014feeling emasculated if his wife earns more. That's a classic case of traditional gender roles affecting personal feelings. The wife, on the other hand, is considering pursuing her dream despite loving her current job. Her parents are supporting her financially, so there's no financial burden on them. The author's main argument is about his own discomfort with the shift in their financial roles.\n\nNow, thinking about right and wrong. Is it wrong for someone to feel uncomfortable if their partner earns more? Well, the author isn't trying to stop her from pursuing her dream for her own sake; his reason is purely his own insecurities. That seems problematic because it centers on his feelings rather than her aspirations. Also, the wife's decision to go back to school is her own choice, and the parents are funding it, so there's no financial pressure. The author's objection is based on his own ego, which might not be a valid reason to discourage her.\n\nAnother angle: The wife already made a choice to put her education on hold for their relationship. Now she's reevaluating her dreams. The author's role in supporting her decisions is important. If he's the one who was supportive when she put her plans aside, but now is resistant to her pursuing them again, that could be seen as inconsistent or controlling. The fact that he's the one making money now because of her sacrifice might make his hesitation even more questionable.\n\nAlso, the societal expectation that men should be the primary earners can play a role here. The author's feelings of emasculation stem from this, which is a traditional view that doesn't account for modern relationships where both partners can have careers. The wife's decision isn't about surpassing him in terms of financial provision but about personal fulfillment and career growth. The author's stance might be seen as selfish if he's prioritizing his own feelings over her happiness and goals.\n\nHowever, there's a nuance here. The author mentions they live comfortably on his salary alone, so there's no financial need. But the wife's decision is about her own career path. The author's main issue is emotional. The question is whether his feelings justify him trying to stop her. Since her parents are funding the education, there's no added financial strain on them. The author's objection is purely based on his own discomfort, which might not be a valid reason to oppose her decision.\n\nIn terms of relationships, communication is key. The author did talk to her about his concerns, but his reasons were about his feelings rather than practical issues. If the wife values her own aspirations, then the author's stance could be seen as undermining her. The fact that he's the one who is making money now and is worried about losing that status might indicate a lack of support for her personal growth.\n\nSo putting it all together: The author's main problem is his own ego and traditional views about gender roles. The wife's decision is about her own happiness and career, which should be supported. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for not supporting her decision based on his own insecurities.\n"
