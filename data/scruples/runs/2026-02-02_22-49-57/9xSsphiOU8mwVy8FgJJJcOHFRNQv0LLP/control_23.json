I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him.\n\nFirst, the situation: The husband is earning enough for both, and the wife is currently working but making less. Her parents offered to pay for her grad school, which would lead to a higher salary. The husband is against it because he's comfortable being the sole provider and feels it would make him feel emasculated if she made more.\n\nNow, considering the key points. The husband admits he's not happy about the idea because he likes being the breadwinner. That's his personal feeling, but the question is whether that makes him in the wrong. \n\nIn terms of rights and autonomy, the wife has the right to pursue her education and career. The husband's feelings about financial roles shouldn't override her personal goals. Even though they don't plan to have kids, her career choice is her own. The husband's concern about feeling emasculated is a personal issue, but it doesn't give him the right to hinder her ambitions. \n\nAlso, the wife's parents are offering financial support, so it's not a financial burden on them. The husband's objection seems to stem from his ego rather than practical reasons. The wife's decision to explore her dream career is valid, and the husband's opposition without a valid reason (like financial necessity) is problematic.\n\nSo, even though the husband's feelings are real, the wife's autonomy and right to pursue her goals take precedence. The answer is likely A, the author is in the wrong because he's prioritizing his ego over his wife's aspirations.\n"
