I make more than enough for us to live very comfortably on my salary alone. My wife works but makes less than half of what I do. We don't plan on having kids so there's no reason why we need to increase our earning potential. \nWhile I was getting my master's degree, my wife (then-girlfriend) decided to put her graduate school plans on the back burner so that she could work full-time and support us as a couple. She ended up finding a job that she loved and eventually she stopped talking about going to grad school. I thought she would end up staying in this job (or a similar one) until retirement.\n\nHer parents are very wealthy and they recently offered to pay all of her tuition and educational expenses if she goes to graduate school. Honestly, I think they're a little embarrassed that their daughter only has a bachelor's degree since they both have graduate degrees. The program that she was, and apparently still is, interested in would put her on a path to make a higher salary than I currently do.\n\nI thought she wasn't interested in graduate school anymore so I was a little taken aback when she told me how excited she was at the prospect of going back to school. She asked me what my thoughts were and I told her I wasn't sure if it was a good idea. I talked to her about how much she loves her current job and how this other career path is drastically different. She told me that while she loves her current job she'd rather pursue her dream. I backed off but I think she could tell that I was wasn't happy.\n\nThe real reason why I don't want her to pursue this option is because I've grown to like the fact that I'm the breadwinner. It makes me feel good that I support both of us financially. Honestly, I would feel emasculated if I made less than her. I know that's an unpopular opinion but I don't think any guy can honestly say that he feels \"good enough\" for a woman that he makes less than. It would be different if we weren't living comfortably but we have all the money we need. AITA?\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is at fault for not wanting his wife to pursue a career that would make her earn more than him. The situation involves their financial situation, their plans (no kids), and his feelings about being the primary breadwinner.\n\nFirst, the author acknowledges that the title sounds bad but provides context. He and his wife are in their late 20s, he's the main earner, and they live comfortably. She's currently working but making less than half of his salary. She put her grad school plans on hold to support them financially when he was in school. Now her parents offer to pay for her grad school, which could lead to a higher salary than his.\n\nHe's conflicted because he's used to being the breadwinner and feels emasculated if he makes less. The user initially thought the author wasn't in the wrong but wants confirmation.\n\nI need to consider societal norms, personal values, and equality in relationships. The author's feelings are valid, but his reasoning is based on traditional gender roles which might be problematic. However, the question is whether he's in the wrong. If the wife wants to pursue her goals, should he be supportive even if it changes their dynamic? The fact that they don't need the money for kids is a point in his favor. But his hesitation is due to ego, not practical reasons. \n\nIn terms of fairness, supporting a partner's aspirations is generally considered important in a healthy relationship. His resistance is based on his own insecurities rather than her best interest. So, even if his feelings are real, the action of discouraging her for personal reasons might make him at fault.\n"
