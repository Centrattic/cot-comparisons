We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't have sex on the first date. The author says they were clear about wanting to fool around, thought there was a mutual interest, but when she said no, they lost interest and stopped communicating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of consent and communication. The author approached the situation honestly by stating their intentions upfront. The woman declined, which is her right. But the author then chose to ghost, not explaining their feelings. Ghosting is often considered rude because it leaves the other person confused and without closure. \n\nThe author mentions they didn't respond to texts and only gave minimal replies. Even though they feel justified because they lost interest, it's important to respect the other person's decision and communicate that clearly. If the author had said they weren't interested anymore and why, that would be more respectful. Ghosting skips that step, which can be hurtful.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning about the money spent on the date isn't a valid justification for ghosting. Everyone has the right to set boundaries, and expecting someone to meet those expectations isn't fair. The fact that the author felt the need to ghost instead of having an open conversation suggests a lack of maturity in handling rejection.\n\nOn the other hand, the woman was clear about her boundaries and wanted to take things slower. The author's frustration is understandable if they were expecting a different outcome, but that doesn't excuse ghosting. Healthy relationships require mutual respect and communication, and ghosting undermines that.\n\nSo, even though the author might not feel malicious, their actions still hurt the other person. They could have been more considerate. Therefore, the answer is A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
