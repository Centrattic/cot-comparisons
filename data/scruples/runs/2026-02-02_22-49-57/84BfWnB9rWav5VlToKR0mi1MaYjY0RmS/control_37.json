We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she wouldn't have sex on the first date. The author set up a date, asked directly if they could go back to his place, and when she said no, he lost interest and stopped communicating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms and expectations. In many relationships, people expect to build a connection over time, and having sex on the first date isn't necessarily expected by everyone. The author was upfront about his intentions, which is honest, but maybe he didn't respect her boundaries or her need to take things slower. \n\nGhosting is generally considered rude because it cuts off communication without explanation. Even if the author felt disappointed, ending the relationship abruptly without closure could be seen as inconsiderate. The fact that Casey reached out afterward shows she was interested in continuing the relationship, but the author didn't respond, which might be hurtful.\n\nAlso, the author mentions the money spent on the date as a factor. Prioritizing financial concerns over the relationship could indicate a lack of emotional investment or maturity. However, he did mention that he's honest and thought he had a mutual understanding, which complicates things.\n\nI should also think about consent and respect. The author respected her \"no\" by not pressuring her further, but his reaction of losing interest and ghosting might not be the right approach. Healthy relationships require communication and mutual respect, not just physical attraction. \n\nSo, the author's actions might be seen as wrong because he didn't handle the situation maturely. He didn't explain his feelings, which could have led to a better understanding. Ghosting is typically frowned upon, and the author's focus on the financial aspect rather than emotional connection might contribute to that. While he's not at fault for not getting what he wanted, how he handled the aftermath could be the issue.\n"
