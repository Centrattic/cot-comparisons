We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she didn't have sex on the first date. So, first, I need to understand both sides of the situation.\n\nThe author asked Casey directly if she wanted to \"fool around,\" and she said no, not that night. He expected a \"yes,\" but she wanted to take things slower. He then lost interest, stopped responding, and now is just giving minimal replies. The question is whether that's wrong.\n\nFrom Casey's perspective, she was clear about her boundaries and wanted the relationship to develop at a different pace. She even expressed that she liked him and wanted to see her on a second date. By ghosting her, the author didn't communicate his feelings properly, which can be hurtful. Communication is key in relationships, especially when expectations might not align. The author's decision to disengage without explaining his feelings is a form of disrespect. It's important to acknowledge that everyone has different comfort levels and timelines when it comes to intimacy. The fact that the author lost interest because his expectations weren't met suggests a lack of respect for Casey's boundaries and autonomy. Ghosting isn't a mature way to handle the situation. Instead of cutting off communication, he should have expressed his feelings and made a mutual decision. The financial aspect (\"wasted money\") is a red flag because it implies he valued the physical aspect more than the relationship and her feelings.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions were inconsiderate and disrespectful. He failed to communicate effectively, dismissed her boundaries, and used ghosting as a way to avoid a difficult conversation. Therefore, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
