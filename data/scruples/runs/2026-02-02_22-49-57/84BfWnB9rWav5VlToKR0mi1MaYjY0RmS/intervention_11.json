We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for ghosting after the first date when the girl said no. \n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and Casey have been flirting for a couple of months, and there were rumors she had feelings. They went on a first date, and he asked if she wanted to go back to his place. She said no, preferring to take things slower. He then lost interest, didn't respond much, and ghosted her. He feels justified because he lost interest, but people might see it as wrong.\n\nHmm, so the key points are: he was honest but maybe too direct, she wanted to take things slow, and he ghosted because he wasn't interested anymore. Now, is this the author's fault? \n\nIn relationships or dating, communication is key. He was upfront about wanting to fool around, which she wasn't comfortable with. She still expressed interest in seeing him again. He, however, shut down after her refusal. Ghosting is generally seen as disrespectful because you cut off communication without explanation. Even if he lost interest, it might be better to have a conversation rather than ghost.\n\nBut he mentions he's honest and that he's not trying to hurt her. Maybe he just doesn't want to invest more time if there's no immediate physical connection. However, his reasoning about the money he spent might be a red flag. Prioritizing money over respect for her boundaries could make him look more in the wrong. Also, the fact that he didn't respond to her texts afterward is ghosting, which is usually frowned upon.\n\nOn the other hand, if he's not interested in continuing, maybe it's his right. But the way he handled it\u2014ghosting\u2014could be considered inconsiderate. So, I'm leaning towards the author being in the wrong because he didn't communicate his feelings and instead cut her off. Even if he doesn't want to pursue further, a simple explanation would be better. Ghosting is typically seen as not considering the other person's feelings.\n"
