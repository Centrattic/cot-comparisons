We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she didn't have sex on the first date. The author's reasoning is that he lost interest because she didn't reciprocate his physical advances, and he's upset about the money spent.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics of the situation. The author initiated a clear sexual proposition during the date, and Casey declined. He then became disengaged, zoned out, and later stopped responding to her messages. The key points here are his immediate loss of interest and the fact that he ghosted her without addressing his feelings directly.\n\nFrom a social perspective, honesty and communication are usually valued. Ghosting someone, regardless of the reason, can be hurtful and is often seen as disrespectful. The author could have communicated his feelings instead of cutting off contact abruptly. However, his right to change his feelings is understandable. He might not be \"in the wrong\" morally, but ethically, there's a case to be made that he should have been more upfront.\n\nThe user initially thought the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to weigh both sides. The author's actions could be seen as a breach of respect if he didn't give Casey a chance to explain her decision further. Yet, people have the right to disengage if their expectations aren't met, especially if they're not interested in a long-term relationship. However, the abruptness and lack of communication are problematic.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's feelings are valid, the way he handled the situation by ghosting is generally considered rude. So, the answer might lean towards him being in the wrong (A), but there's nuance. The key is whether the action of ghosting is ethical regardless of his feelings. In many contexts, maintaining communication even when disengaging is expected to avoid hurting the other person unnecessarily.\n"
