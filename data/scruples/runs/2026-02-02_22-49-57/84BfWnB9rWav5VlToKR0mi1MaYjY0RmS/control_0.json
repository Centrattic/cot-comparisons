We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting the girl after she wouldn't have sex on the first date. The author was explicit about wanting to fool around, and when she said no, he lost interest and stopped communicating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author approached the date with the intention of having sex, which he made clear. If the girl said no and he just shut off, that seems pretty callous. Ghosting is generally considered rude because it leaves the other person without closure. Also, the fact that he was focused on the money he spent might indicate he was more interested in getting something (sex) in return rather than building a relationship. \n\nBut wait, he says he's honest and thought he had a \"done deal.\" Maybe he was surprised she said no. But even so, respecting her decision is important. The fact that he's not replying to her texts shows a lack of consideration for her feelings. Even if he lost interest, a simple message explaining that he's not interested anymore would be better than ghosting.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that he's not obligated to continue talking if he's not interested. But generally, being upfront about disinterest is considered better than ghosting. So the consensus here is that the author is in the wrong because he didn't communicate his disinterest properly and was dismissive of her feelings. Also, prioritizing his own expectations over her boundaries isn't good. So the answer is A.\n"
