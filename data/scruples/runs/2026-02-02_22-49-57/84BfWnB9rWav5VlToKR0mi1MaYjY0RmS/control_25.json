We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

Hmm.\n\nFirst, the author set up a date, asked directly if she wanted to go back to his place, and she said no. He then lost interest and stopped responding. The key points here are communication and respect. \n\nHe was honest about his intentions upfront, which is good. But when she declined, he didn't engage further. She tried to reach out after, but he ghosted. Now, the question is whether that's wrong. \n\nWell, if he was clear about his expectations and she wasn't meeting them, maybe he's not entirely wrong. But the issue is that she was interested and wanted to take it slower. Ghosting isn't a respectful response. Even if he lost interest, he should have communicated that properly instead of cutting off all contact. \n\nAlso, the money spent on the date shouldn't matter. Using her refusal as a reason to ghost because of financial reasons is a bit shallow. Relationships shouldn't be transactional like that. \n\nSo, while he might have been honest about his expectations, not respecting her decision and ghosting is where he's in the wrong. The right approach would have been to have a mature conversation about their differing expectations rather than cutting her off abruptly.\n"
