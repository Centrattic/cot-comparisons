We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she wouldn't have sex on the first date. The author is male, and he set up expectations by asking her directly if she wanted to go back to his place. She said no, and he lost interest, so he stopped responding.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author was upfront about his intentions. He asked her bluntly if she wanted to fool around, which he says he's honest about. She declined and said she wanted to take things slower. The author then felt like he \"struck out\" and stopped engaging with her. He's justified it by saying he lost interest and doesn't want to invest more time or money if there's a risk of not getting what he wanted.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, respecting someone's boundaries is important. Even if he was honest about his expectations, she has the right to say no and set her own boundaries. The problem here is that the author didn't respect her decision and instead ghosted her, which can be hurtful. Ghosting is often seen as a lack of respect because it leaves the other person without closure.\n\nAnother angle is communication. The author didn't explain his feelings or his need for physical intimacy to her. Instead, he made a unilateral decision to cut off contact, which might be considered dismissive of her feelings. Even if he felt rejected, the appropriate response would be to communicate that and maybe discuss differing expectations rather than ghosting.\n\nAlso, the financial aspect he mentions (feeling like he wasted money) is a bit of an afterthought. While people might understand the frustration, it's not a valid reason to ghost someone. Relationships and interactions shouldn't be about financial transactions. His focus on the money spent could indicate a transactional view of the relationship, which isn't healthy.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that he was honest about his intentions, and if she wasn't interested, then it's natural for him to lose interest. However, even in that case, ghosting is still considered rude. A better approach would be to be honest about his feelings after the date, let her know that he was there for a specific reason, and that he's not interested in continuing if she's not willing to meet his expectations.\n\nIn many relationship advice contexts, it's emphasized that honesty is important, but so is respect for the other person's autonomy. The author's approach here lacks the latter. He didn't consider her feelings or the impact of ghosting on her. She might have been hurt or confused, especially since she reached out afterward. Ignoring her texts adds insult to injury.\n\nSo, putting this all together, the author's actions\u2014while perhaps understandable from a personal desire perspective\u2014are ethically questionable because he didn't respect her boundaries and left the situation abruptly without communication. Therefore, he's likely in the wrong.\n"
