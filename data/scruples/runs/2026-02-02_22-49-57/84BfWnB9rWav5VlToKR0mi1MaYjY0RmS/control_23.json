We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't sleep with him on the first date.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author had known Casey for 8 months, some flirting over 2 months, and rumors she had a crush for 5-6 months. The first date was dinner and a movie. He asked directly if they could go back to his place to \"fool around.\" She said no, not that night, and said they should take it slow. He then zoned out during the date, thought about the money spent, and after that, only gave minimal responses to her texts. He's ghosting her because she didn't give him what he wanted on the first date.\n\nNow, to determine if he's in the wrong. Ghosting is generally considered rude because it's cutting off communication without explanation. Even if someone loses interest, a simple message to explain is better than disappearing. The author's main issue is that he expected her to be okay with having sex on the first date, and when she wasn't, he lost interest. That shows he wasn't respecting her boundaries and only saw her as a means to an end. Also, he's focusing on the money spent, which isn't her responsibility. She made it clear she wanted to take things slower, which is a valid preference. His reaction of ghosting is dismissive and disrespectful. \n\nSo, even if he's honest about his intentions, the way he handled the rejection is the problem. He didn't communicate his feelings properly and chose to ignore her attempts to reach out. That's the asshole move here. So the answer is A, he's in the wrong.\n"
