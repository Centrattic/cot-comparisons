We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the author of the given story is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she didn't have sex on the first date. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author and Casey have been flirting for two months, with rumors of her having feelings for him for longer. On their first date, he asks her directly if they can go back to his place to \"fool around.\" She says no, not tonight, and wants things to develop. He then zones out, the date ends awkwardly, and he hasn't responded to her texts since, effectively ghosting her. The author's reasoning is that he lost interest because she didn't sleep with him, and he feels like he wasted money on the date.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Let's consider a few angles. \n\nRespect and Consent: The author approached Casey directly about wanting to have sex, which is honest, but pressuring someone for sex on a first date can be problematic. She clearly said no, and he respected that by not pursuing it further that night. But then he ghosted her afterward. Ghosting is generally considered rude because it cuts off communication without explanation. Even if he's no longer interested, a simple message explaining that he's not interested anymore would be more respectful.\n\nExpectations and Communication: The author seems to have expected a certain outcome (sex on the first date), which Casey didn't provide. However, expecting someone to engage in sexual activity on the first date isn't a universal standard. People have different boundaries and comfort levels. His approach of being blunt might have been his way of being honest, but it's also possible that he didn't consider her perspective or the fact that she wanted to take things slower. \n\nEmotional Impact: Ghosting can leave the other person confused and hurt. Casey reached out to him, showing she's still interested or at least polite. By ignoring her, he's causing emotional distress without justification. Even if he's not interested anymore, a polite goodbye would be better than cutting off all contact.\n\nFinancial Considerations: He mentions the money spent on the date. However, treating someone to a date shouldn't be seen as a transactional investment. If he's using the financial aspect as a reason for ghosting, that's a red flag. Relationships and interactions shouldn't be based on perceived value exchanged.\n\nPersonal Responsibility: The author is taking responsibility for his actions by not wanting to continue, but the method (ghosting) is the issue. It's important to handle the situation with maturity and respect, even if the feelings have changed.\n\nIn conclusion, while the author's expectations might not be inherently wrong, the way he handled the situation\u2014ghosting and not communicating his disinterest\u2014is disrespectful. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
