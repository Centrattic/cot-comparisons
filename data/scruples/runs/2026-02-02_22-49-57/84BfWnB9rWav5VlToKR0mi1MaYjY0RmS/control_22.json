We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for ghosting after the girl didn't have sex on the first date. The question is whether the author is an asshole (AITA) for this behavior.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and Casey have been flirting for two months, with rumors of her having feelings for him for 5-6 months. They went on a first date, which was nice, and the author asked her directly if they could go back to his place to \"fool around.\" She said no, not tonight, and suggested waiting for a second date. The author then zoned out during the rest of the date, felt the money was wasted, and now is ignoring her texts, giving minimal responses. He's lost interest because she didn't give him sex on the first date and doesn't want to spend more money on another date where it might not happen again.\n\nThe key points here are: the author's decision to ask for sex on a first date, the girl's refusal, and the author's subsequent ghosting. \n\nEthically, pressuring someone for sex on the first date is questionable. Even if the author is honest, it's not a given that the other person will agree. The girl's response was to set a boundary, which is her right. The author's reaction\u2014losing all interest and ghosting\u2014seems disrespectful. Ghosting can be hurtful and dismissive, not considering the other person's feelings or the fact that she respected her own boundaries.\n\nAlso, the author is focusing on the financial aspect (\"spent a fair bit of change on that first date\") as a reason to cut her off. This suggests that he's treating the relationship as transactional, which is not healthy. Relationships should be about mutual respect and connection, not about expecting something in return, especially not sex on the first date.\n\nMoreover, the author admits he's not responding to her texts, which are attempts to communicate and possibly reconcile or understand what went wrong. By ghosting, he's avoiding communication, which is a cowardly way to handle the situation. Even if he's not interested anymore, a respectful response would be to explain his feelings instead of ignoring her.\n\nSo, putting this all together: the author acted unilaterally, pressured for sex, and then dismissed her when she refused. His actions show a lack of respect for her boundaries and a self-centered approach. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
