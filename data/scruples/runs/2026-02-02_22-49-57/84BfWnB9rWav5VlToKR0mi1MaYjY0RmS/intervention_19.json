We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she declined sexual activity on the first date. The author's reasoning is that he lost interest and doesn't want to invest more time or money without the expectation of physical intimacy. \n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms and expectations. Ghosting is generally frowned upon because it's abrupt and can be hurtful. The author didn't communicate his feelings directly; instead, he just stopped responding. That's a red flag. Even if he's not interested anymore, a better approach would be to explain his feelings to Casey respectfully.\n\nNext, the situation: The author made a clear move to have physical contact, and Casey set a boundary by saying no. He acknowledges that she wanted to take things slower. However, he didn't engage in the conversation after that, which might indicate he wasn't respecting her boundaries. His focus on the money spent also seems to show a transactional view of the date, which isn't healthy.\n\nBut the author claims he's being honest and that he's not interested anymore. While it's okay to lose interest, the way he handled it is problematic. The key issue is the lack of communication. Ghosting can leave the other person confused and hurt, even if the decision to disengage is personal.\n\nSo, while the author's actions might not be malicious, the method he used to cut off contact is considered inconsiderate. Therefore, he's somewhat at fault for not handling the situation with more communication and empathy.\n"
