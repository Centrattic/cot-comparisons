We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't sleep with him on the first date. The author says he asked bluntly if they could go back to his place, and when she said no, he just lost interest and stopped responding.\n\nHmm, first, I need to consider the context. Ghosting is generally seen as bad because it's abrupt and can hurt the other person. But the author mentions he thought she had a crush on him for months, so maybe he thought the no was unexpected. He also talks about the money spent on the date, which might indicate he's more interested in a transactional perspective. \n\nWait, the question is whether he's in the wrong. From a social standpoint, even if he's honest, cutting off communication without explanation can be hurtful. People usually try to communicate their feelings rather than just disappearing. Also, the author admits he's not trying to hurt her, but his actions still do. \n\nOn the other hand, he's being honest about his intentions. If he's clear about needing physical intimacy and she's not ready, maybe he's within his rights to disengage. But the problem is that he didn't communicate that decision properly. Ghosting isn't just about the decision to move on but how you handle it. \n\nSo, the key points are: he asked for sex and got a no, then ghosted. Is that okay? Social norms usually encourage respect and communication, even if the relationship isn't working out. So, while his feelings are valid, the way he ended it might be the issue. \n\nTherefore, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he didn't handle it respectfully. But some might argue B (not in the wrong) if they believe people can change their minds based on rejection. But I think the main issue is the ghosting part, not the loss of interest. So, he's in the wrong for ghosting rather than having the conversation.\n"
