We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the story is in the wrong. The situation is about ghosting a girl named Casey after she didn't sleep with him on their first date.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author states they asked her directly if they could go back to his place after the first date. She said \"no, not tonight\" and suggested they see on the second date. The author then lost interest, stopped responding, and hasn't engaged much since. He mentions not wanting to spend more money without the chance of getting \"any\" that time either.\n\nNow, considering right and wrong here. Ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate because it cuts off communication abruptly without explanation. However, the author is honest about his motivations. He felt like they had a done deal, but she turned him down. He's disappointed and lost interest. \n\nBut is it wrong to not want to continue a relationship if there's a mismatch in expectations? The author approached her honestly, asked directly, and she set boundaries. The issue here might be his reaction rather than the act of ghosting. If he's being honest about his intentions, but his response was to cut her off without communication, that's where the potential problem is.\n\nAlso, the money aspect is mentioned. He's upset about the cost, which adds a transactional element. That could be a red flag in his approach. However, the main ethical question is whether it's okay to ghost someone after rejection. \n\nDifferent perspectives: Some might say it's his prerogative if he's not interested anymore. Others would argue that ending communication like that is disrespectful, regardless of reasons. The author isn't trying to hurt her, but the act of ghosting is still hurtful by default.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, while people have different views on relationships and sex, the act of suddenly cutting off communication is often criticized. So, the answer might lean towards AITA because the author is inconsiderate by ghosting. But maybe the community would take into account that he was honest from the start and just didn't want to pursue it further. \n\nI think the key here is that the author's wrong isn't in the decision to not be interested, but in the ghosting. If he had communicated that he's not interested anymore, it would be better. Since he just stopped responding without any explanation, he's in the wrong. Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
