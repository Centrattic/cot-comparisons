We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't have sex on the first date. The options are A (yes) or B (no). \n\nFirst, I need to consider the situation from both sides. The author went on a first date, asked directly if they could \"fool around,\" and the woman said \"not tonight,\" suggesting they wait until a second date. The author then lost interest, stopped responding, and justified it by saying he's not interested in continuing because he spent money and wants a physical relationship.\n\nFrom a relationship ethics perspective, communication and mutual consent are key. The author was upfront about his intentions, which is good, but the woman set a boundary. The problem here is that the author seems to have valued a physical connection over the relationship's progression. By ghosting her after she declined, he's dismissing her boundaries and his own lack of interest in continuing the relationship respectfully.\n\nGhosting is generally considered rude because it cuts off communication without explanation, which can be hurtful. The woman tried to reach out after, and the author's minimal responses (like thumbs up) are dismissive. Even if the author's interest waned, the appropriate response would be to communicate that clearly instead of ignoring her. \n\nAdditionally, the author's reasoning\u2014dismissing her because he spent money and didn't get what he wanted\u2014seems transactional. A healthy relationship shouldn't be based on such conditions. The fact that the woman was willing to go on a second date shows she's interested in building a connection, but the author is prioritizing his own expectations over her comfort and the potential for a real relationship.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because he ghosted someone after she set a boundary, didn't communicate his disinterest respectfully, and acted in a way that could be seen as disrespectful to her decisions.\n"
