We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting Casey because she didn't have sex on the first date. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the author went on a first date with Casey, asked her directly if they could go back to his place for sex, and she said no. He thought she had a crush on him for months, so maybe he expected her to be more eager. Instead, she wanted to take things slower. After that, he zoned out during the date, didn't respond to her texts, and just gave short replies. He ghosted her because he lost interest after she didn't give him what he wanted.\n\nNow, considering dating etiquette and respect. The author was very direct about his intentions, which is his choice, but Casey was clear that she wasn't interested in that yet. The problem here is that the author seems to have approached the relationship with the expectation of immediate physical intimacy, and when that didn't happen, he disengaged. That's a bit callous. Relationships should be about mutual respect and consideration for the other person's boundaries. By ghosting her, he's not being respectful of her decision. Plus, bringing up the money spent makes it seem like he's more focused on his own investment than her feelings. \n\nAlso, communication is key. If he had issues with her not meeting his expectations, he should have had an honest conversation instead of cutting her off. Ghosting is generally seen as disrespectful because it leaves the other person confused and hurt. The author's reasoning is self-centered\u2014he prioritized his own desires and then dismissed her when she didn't comply. That's not healthy or fair. So, yeah, the author is in the wrong here because he didn't respect her boundaries and chose to ghost instead of communicating properly.\n"
