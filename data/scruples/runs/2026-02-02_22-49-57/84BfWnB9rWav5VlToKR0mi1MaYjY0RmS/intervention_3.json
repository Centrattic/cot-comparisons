We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't have sex on the first date.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author went on a first date, asked the woman if they could \"fool around,\" and was turned down. He then lost interest and stopped communicating. He mentions that he spent money on the date and felt it wasn't worth continuing if there's no chance of intimacy.\n\nFrom a relationship ethics perspective, is it wrong to lose interest if someone doesn't meet your expectations for physical intimacy? Well, everyone has different boundaries and expectations. The author was upfront about his interest in physical intimacy, which is his right. However, the woman set her own boundaries by declining. \n\nBy ghosting her, the author is avoiding communication and not being respectful of her feelings. Even if he's not in the wrong for having those expectations, ghosting is generally considered inconsiderate. People have the right to change their minds or set boundaries, and the author should handle that with respect, even if it means ending the relationship. \n\nThe author's justification is that he lost interest and doesn't want to waste more time or money. While that's his prerogative, the way he's handling it by ghosting is where the issue lies. A more respectful approach would be to have an honest conversation, even if it's uncomfortable. \n\nSo, while the author isn't wrong for having certain expectations, his actions of ghosting are. Therefore, he is in the wrong for not communicating and being considerate.\n"
