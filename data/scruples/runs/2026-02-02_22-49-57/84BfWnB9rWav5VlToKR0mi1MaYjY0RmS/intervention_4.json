We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for ghosting after the woman didn't sleep with him on the first date. Hmm.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The guy asked her directly if they could fool around after their first date, and she said no. He thought she had a crush on him, but she wanted to take it slower. After that, he zoned out during dinner, felt like he wasted money, and now he's ghosting her by not responding except with minimal replies.\n\nSo the question is whether he's in the wrong. From a moral standpoint, ghosting someone after they set a boundary might be seen as dismissive and hurtful. She made it clear she wasn't interested in physical relations that night and wanted to continue the relationship. He chose to cut off communication because she didn't meet his expectations. \n\nEven if he says it's not to hurt her, the act of ghosting can be emotionally damaging. People have different boundaries and expectations, and it's important to respect them. The guy's main issue seems to be about his own expectations not being met and the financial aspect. But using someone's refusal as a reason to end all contact might be considered immature or selfish.\n\nOn the other hand, some might argue that he's being honest about his feelings and that he's not interested in continuing the relationship. But usually, even if you're not interested, a decent person would communicate that clearly instead of ghosting. So, I think the answer leans towards A, the author is in the wrong for ghosting without a proper explanation.\n"
