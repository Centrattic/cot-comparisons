We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she didn't have sex on the first date. They want to know if the answer is A or B.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author, let's call him John, had known Casey for 8 months and had been flirting for 2 of those. They went on their first date, which included dinner and a movie. John asked bluntly if she wanted to go back to his place to \"fool around,\" and she said no, not tonight. She mentioned she wanted to let things develop. John felt disappointed, zoned out during dinner, didn't respond to her texts after, and now just gives minimal replies. He's considering his actions not wrong because he lost interest after she didn't have sex on the first date and he spent money.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. I need to think about social norms, communication, and respect in relationships. Ghosting is generally seen as rude because it cuts off all contact without explanation, leaving the other person confused. But the context matters here. John was upfront about his intentions, and Casey set boundaries. He might feel disrespected when she didn't meet his expectations, but is that a valid reason to ghost her?\n\nOn one hand, John might feel rejected and frustrated, especially if he thought there was mutual interest. On the other hand, Casey made it clear she wanted to take things slower, and John's response was to cut her off instead of discussing his feelings. Communication is key in relationships, and instead of being honest about his expectations, he reacted negatively when they weren't met. That's problematic because it's not about her saying no, but his reaction to it.\n\nAlso, the fact that he's focusing on the money spent and the immediate gratification he expected might show a lack of consideration for the emotional aspect of the relationship. Relationships aren't transactional, and valuing them based on immediate physical outcomes can be disrespectful. Ghosting skips the step of explaining his feelings, which Casey might need to understand what's happening.\n\nHowever, some people might argue that if someone is only interested in a relationship for physical reasons, they're not a good match. But the issue here is how he handled it. Instead of being honest that he was only interested if there was immediate physical intimacy, he didn't communicate that up front. He assumed she would say yes, and when she didn't, he punished her with ghosting. That's not a mature approach.\n\nSo considering all this, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong) because ghosting is inconsiderate, and his actions stem from unmet expectations without proper communication. He should have discussed his feelings or at least been honest after the date instead of cutting her off abruptly.\n"
