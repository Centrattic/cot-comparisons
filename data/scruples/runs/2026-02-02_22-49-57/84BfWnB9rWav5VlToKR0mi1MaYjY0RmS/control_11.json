We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she wouldn't have sex on the first date. I need to figure out if the author's actions are considered wrong here.\n\nFirst, the author went on a first date with Casey, who had a crush on him for months. He asked her directly if they could go back to his place to \"fool around,\" and she said no, wanting to take things slower. He then lost interest and hasn't responded to her texts, effectively ghosting her. He mentions he spent money on the date and feels it wasn't worth it since he didn't get what he wanted.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author was honest about his intentions upfront, which might be okay, but he didn't respect her boundaries when she said no. Ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate, regardless of the reason. Even if he lost interest, cutting off communication without explanation can be hurtful. The fact that he was focused on getting physical rather than building a relationship might also be a red flag. However, he's being honest about his expectations, but maybe not considerate of hers. \n\nIn terms of social norms, pressuring someone for sex on a first date is often frowned upon, and respecting her decision to take things slower is important. Ghosting is usually seen as the ghoster's fault because it leaves the other person confused and without closure. The author's focus on not wanting to spend more money or effort if there's no immediate sexual reward suggests he may not have had genuine interest in a relationship. \n\nOn the other hand, he did say he's being honest, which some might argue is his right. But honesty shouldn't come at the expense of respecting someone's comfort and boundaries. The fact that he didn't engage in the conversation after she said no shows he wasn't really listening or valuing her feelings during the date. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions\u2014pressuring for sex, not respecting her decision, and then ghosting\u2014are likely considered wrong. The answer would be A, yes, he's in the wrong.\n"
