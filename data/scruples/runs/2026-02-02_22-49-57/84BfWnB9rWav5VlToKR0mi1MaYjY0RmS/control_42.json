We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she refused to have sex on the first date. The question is whether the author's actions are justified or not.\n\nFirst, I need to look at the situation. The author went on a first date with Casey, asked her directly if they could go back to his place, and she said no. He felt disappointed, thought he had a \"done deal\" since she supposedly had a crush on him. After she declined, he zoned out during dinner and later ghosted her by only responding with minimal texts. Now he's wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, respect is a big factor. Even if he was disappointed, cutting her off completely without communication is ghosting. That's generally considered rude. People have different boundaries, and just because someone didn't meet his expectations doesn't mean he's justified in punishing her. Plus, he acknowledges that she's made an effort to reach out, but he's ignoring her. That's being inconsiderate.\n\nAlso, the reason he's giving is that he lost interest because she didn't agree to sex. That's a bit shallow. If a relationship is only based on physical attraction without considering emotional connection, then it's not a solid foundation. So, he's prioritizing his own needs over hers and acting dismissively.\n\nHe also mentions the money spent on the date. That's not her responsibility. If he can't handle rejection without feeling like he's lost money, that's his issue. Using that as a reason to ghost isn't fair. It sounds more like a justification for his reaction rather than a valid reason.\n\nIn terms of communication, he didn't address his feelings directly with her. Instead, he just stopped responding. If he had a problem, he should have talked to her about it instead of ghosting. That's a key part of being considerate and respectful in relationships.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong. He didn't handle the situation respectfully, ghosted her, and used his own disappointment as a rationale without considering her feelings. The answer should be A.\n"
