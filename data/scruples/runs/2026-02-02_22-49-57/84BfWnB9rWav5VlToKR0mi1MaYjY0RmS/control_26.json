We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't sleep with him on the first date. The author set up the date, asked her directly if they could go back to his place, she declined, and then he lost interest, stopped responding, and now isn't replying to her texts.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the expectations both parties had. The author thought he had a \"done deal\" because he believed she had a crush on him. But she clearly stated she wasn't interested in that yet and wanted things to develop. The key point here is that the author valued physical intimacy highly in this context. If he's only interested in a relationship where there's immediate sexual activity, then he might have set himself up for disappointment if the other person has different expectations.\n\nGhosting is generally considered rude because it cuts off communication without explanation. Even if he's not interested anymore, responding politely to explain his feelings would be better. However, he might argue that he's not obligated to continue a relationship if his expectations aren't met. But the problem is that he didn't communicate his needs upfront. If he's only interested in a relationship that includes immediate sex, maybe he should have been clearer about that before the date. \n\nAnother angle: she tried to communicate her boundaries, and he didn't respect that by continuing to engage in the date. Then, after the fact, he ignored her follow-up texts. That's where the asshole part comes in. She's trying to reach out, and he's cutting her off without explaining. So, even if his feelings changed, he's being unkind by not giving a proper response.\n\nAlso, the financial aspect he mentions (\"spent a fair bit of change\") might be a red herring. It's not about the money; it's about mutual respect and communication. People can have different priorities, but acting on that by ghosting is inconsiderate.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author is in the wrong because he didn't communicate his expectations beforehand and then ghosted her instead of being honest. Even if his feelings changed, the way he handled it was disrespectful.\n"
