We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she refused to have sex on the first date. The author mentions that they had been flirting for a while, Casey had a crush on him, and he thought she was interested. He asked her to go back to his place, but she said no and wanted to take things slower. He then lost interest and hasn't responded to her texts.\n\nSo, the main issue here is whether ghosting is acceptable because she refused his advances. From what I know, relationships, especially in dating, require mutual respect and communication. The author's approach seems pretty direct, which might not be everyone's preference. Casey wanted to take things slowly, which is a valid choice. The fact that the author lost all interest and stopped communicating after she didn't meet his expectations might come off as dismissive or disrespectful.\n\nGhosting is generally considered rude because it cuts off communication without explanation, leaving the other person confused and hurt. The author is justified in not wanting to pursue a relationship if his main interest was physical, but he could have been honest with her instead of ghosting. There's also the mention of money spent on the date, which shouldn't be a factor in whether someone is interested. The author's actions might be seen as selfish and lacking empathy. So, the answer is likely A, he's in the wrong.\n"
