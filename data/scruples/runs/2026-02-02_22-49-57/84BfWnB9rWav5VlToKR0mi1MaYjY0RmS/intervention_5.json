We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking whether the person who wrote this scenario is in the wrong for ghosting their partner after she refused to have sex on the first date. The options are A (yes, they're in the wrong) or B (no). The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author set up a date, asked directly if they could go back to his place, and when she said no, he lost interest and stopped communicating. He justifies it by saying he doesn't want to invest more time or money if there's no possibility of sex. \n\nFrom an ethical standpoint, ghosting is generally considered rude or disrespectful because it cuts off communication without explanation. The author's reasoning is that the lack of immediate physical intimacy made him disinterested, but that doesn't excuse ghosting. People have different boundaries and timelines for intimacy. By being so direct and then ghosting when she said no, he didn't respect her decision or her autonomy. \n\nAlso, the author's focus on financial loss (\"spent a fair bit of change\") shows a transactional view of the relationship, which is problematic. The fact that he was honest about his intentions upfront is part of the issue\u2014she was clear about her boundaries, and he didn't honor that. \n\nWhile the author might feel justified in his actions based on his own desires, the way he ended the interaction is inconsiderate. Healthy relationships require mutual respect, and ghosting doesn't provide that. So even if the author's feelings are hurt, his actions don't make him right. He chose to disregard her consent and his own responsibility to communicate respectfully. \n\nTherefore, the answer is A. He is in the wrong because ghosting without explanation and dismissing her boundaries is not acceptable behavior.\n"
