We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the story is in the wrong for ghosting someone because she didn't have sex on the first date.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author set clear expectations early on by asking to \"fool around\" after the first date. Casey declined, saying she wants things to develop. The author then lost interest, stopped responding, and now is just giving minimal replies. He's justifying it by saying he doesn't want to spend more money if there's no sex.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about respect and communication. The author was honest about his intentions, which is good, but when she said no, he ghosted her. Ghosting is generally considered inconsiderate because it leaves the other person without closure. Even if he's not in the wrong for having those expectations, cutting off communication abruptly is rude. Also, valuing the interaction based on whether there's sex is a bit transactional. Healthy relationships should be about mutual respect and building a connection, not just physical aspects. The author's main issue is that he lost interest after rejection, which is his choice, but the way he handled it (ghosting) is where he might be at fault. So, I think the answer is A because he's being inconsiderate and treating the relationship as conditional on his desires without respecting her boundaries.\n"
