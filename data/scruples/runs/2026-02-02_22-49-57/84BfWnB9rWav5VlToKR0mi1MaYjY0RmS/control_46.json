We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author went on a first date with Casey, asked her to \"fool around\" and she said no, not tonight. The author thought she had a crush for months, but after the rejection, he lost interest and started ghosting her. He didn't respond much beyond minimal replies.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms and expectations. In many cultures, there's an expectation that people should respect each other's boundaries. The author was upfront about his intentions, which is honest, but maybe too direct for a first date. Casey set a boundary by saying no, which she had the right to do. The author then became disinterested and stopped engaging, which could be seen as dismissive or disrespectful. Ghosting is generally frowned upon because it leaves the other person without closure and can be hurtful.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he lost interest because he expected physical intimacy and now doesn't want to invest more time or money without that. But is that a valid reason? People have different expectations in dating, and while the author's honesty is commendable, his reaction to the rejection might be the problem. It's his choice to pursue or not, but ghosting is often seen as an asshole move regardless of the reason. He could have been honest about his feelings of disinterest and explained why, giving Casey closure instead of cutting off communication entirely.\n\nAlso, the author mentions not wanting to spend more money. While financial considerations are part of dating, using them as a reason to cut off someone who hasn't violated any agreed-upon terms might not be the best approach. The key here is mutual respect. If Casey was clear about her boundaries and the author respected them initially but then chose to disengage without explanation, that's where the issue lies.\n\nSo putting it all together, the author is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she set a boundary. He could have communicated his feelings better or accepted her decision and moved on without cutting her off. The answer should be A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
