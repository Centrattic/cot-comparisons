We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author went on a first date with Casey, asked her to fool around, she said no, and then he lost interest and ghosted her. He's justifying it by saying he spent money and doesn't want to go through that again if there's no physical relationship.\n\nFirst, I need to consider relationship etiquette. Ghosting someone after a first date where they didn't get along sexually is a common scenario. The key points here are communication, respect, and expectations. The author was honest about his intentions upfront, which is good, but then became upset when she didn't meet them. That's where the problem might lie.\n\nIn dating, people have different boundaries and expectations. The author expected a certain outcome, but Casey had different standards. It's important to respect her decision without taking it personally. However, the author didn't handle it well. Instead of having a mature conversation, he zoned out, didn't respond properly, and then cut off communication. That's disrespectful, especially since she tried to reach out after.\n\nAlso, the financial angle is a bit of a red herring. The cost of the date shouldn't be a factor in whether someone is interested. The author's focus on money spent might indicate a transactional view of the date, which isn't healthy. The main issue here is that the author didn't respect her boundaries and then ghosted, which is considered inconsiderate.\n\nOn the other hand, people have the right to change their minds or set their own pace. If the author was clear about his expectations and she wasn't interested, it's her prerogative to decline. The problem is the author's reaction, not her decision. So, the author is in the wrong because he didn't handle rejection gracefully and ghosting is a poor response to not getting what he wanted.\n"
