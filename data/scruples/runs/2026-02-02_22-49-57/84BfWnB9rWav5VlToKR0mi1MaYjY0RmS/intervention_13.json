We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user is asking about a situation where someone ghosted a girl after she didn't sleep with him on the first date. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to analyze it.\n\nFirst, what's the context? The guy and Casey have been flirting for two months, known each other for eight. Rumors say she had a crush for 5-6 months. They went on a first date, he asked to go back to his place and she said no, not tonight. He says he thought he had a \"done deal\" because she liked him. He got awkward, zoned out, thought about the money spent, and now isn't responding to her texts.\n\nSo, the question is whether ghosting her is justified. The guy's reasoning is that he lost interest because she didn't sleep with him on the first date. He's not interested in continuing because he doesn't want to invest more money and effort without that outcome.\n\nNow, considering social norms and expectations. In dating, people have different standards. Some people might think that expecting physical intimacy on the first date is too much. Others might think that if someone is only interested in a relationship for sexual purposes, then it's okay to disengage if that doesn't happen. But there's also the aspect of communication and respect.\n\nThe author didn't communicate his expectations clearly before the date. He bluntly asked about fooling around, which Casey rejected. Instead of discussing it openly, he just ghosted her. That could be seen as disrespectful because she expressed interest in continuing the relationship, and he didn't engage in a conversation about his needs or hers. Ghosting without explanation can be hurtful, regardless of the reason.\n\nAlso, the focus on the money spent might indicate that he was more interested in a quick sexual encounter than a genuine connection. That could be a red flag for him. However, it's his prerogative to decide what he wants, but the way he handled it\u2014ghosting instead of being honest\u2014might be the issue.\n\nOn the other hand, if the author is being honest about his own interests and she didn't meet his expectations, then choosing not to pursue further isn't necessarily wrong. But the act of ghosting is often considered inconsiderate, even if the reason is personal. The right approach would be to communicate the decision, even if it's awkward.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author's actions (ghosting) are inconsiderate and lack communication, which is a problem. Therefore, he's in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
