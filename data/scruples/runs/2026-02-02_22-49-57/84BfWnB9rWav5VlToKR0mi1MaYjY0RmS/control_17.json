We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she refused to have sex on the first date. The author set up the situation where they went on a date, asked directly if they could go back to his place, and when she said no, he lost interest and stopped communicating.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications here. Ghosting is generally considered rude because it leaves the other person without closure. The author mentions that he's not responding to her texts, just giving minimal responses. That's pretty clear ghosting behavior.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that he lost interest because she didn't meet his expectations for the first date. But is it reasonable to expect someone to be okay with having sex on the first date? That's a personal preference, but not everyone is comfortable with that. The fact that the girl had a crush for months but still said no suggests she values emotional connection over physical intimacy at this stage.\n\nAlso, the author talks about the money spent on the date, which implies he saw the date as an investment for a sexual encounter. That's a problematic mindset because dating should be about building a relationship, not transactional. Expecting sex after one date without prior discussion about boundaries could be seen as pressuring her.\n\nHowever, the author is honest about his feelings and his loss of interest. He's not pretending to be interested anymore. But the way he handled it\u2014ghosting\u2014is where the issue lies. Even if he's not interested, being honest and explaining his feelings respectfully would be better than cutting off communication abruptly.\n\nSo, putting it all together: the author's expectations might not be unreasonable from his perspective, but his actions (ghosting) and the underlying reasons (expecting sex on the first date and valuing it over her comfort) contribute to him being in the wrong. The key point is that ghosting is considered rude regardless of the reason, and his approach was dismissive of her feelings and boundaries.\n"
