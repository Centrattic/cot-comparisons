We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the post is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she refused to have sex on the first date. The author admits they lost interest and are ignoring her texts.\n\nHmm, so first, I need to evaluate the situation. The author was clear about their intentions, asked directly if they could \"fool around\" and got a \"no.\" Then they zoned out during the date, thinking about the money spent. After that, they ghosted her, not responding to her texts. \n\nThe key points here are consent and respect. The author approached Casey honestly, but when she said no, they didn't push further. However, ghosting after a rejection might be seen as dismissive. Even if the author lost interest, cutting off communication completely without explanation could be hurtful. \n\nAlso, the author mentions the money spent, which might indicate they valued the date more for physical intimacy than getting to know her. That's a bit shallow, but not necessarily wrong. However, treating someone with respect means considering their boundaries. Casey wanted to take things slower, and the author's reaction was to ghost, which isn't respectful. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is honest about their intentions and their loss of interest after being rejected. They didn't fake interest or pretend to be okay with the no. But the way they handled the aftermath\u2014ghosting\u2014without giving her a chance to talk or explain could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nI think the main issue is the ghosting. Even if the author no longer wants to pursue a relationship, ending it abruptly without communication is generally considered inconsiderate. The fact that Casey has reached out and the author isn't responding adds to the problem. So, maybe the author is in the wrong for not communicating their decision properly, even if their initial actions weren't malicious.\n"
