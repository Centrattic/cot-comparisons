We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't have sex on the first date. So, the author set up a date, asked directly if they could go back to his place, and when she said no, he lost interest and stopped communicating. \n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Ghosting is generally considered rude because it leaves the other person confused and without closure. The author's reasoning is that he lost interest because she didn't meet his expectations for physical intimacy. But is that a valid reason to ghost?\n\nFrom a social perspective, people have different boundaries and expectations. The author was clear about his intentions upfront, which Casey might not have been prepared for. She wanted to take things slower, which is her right. By ghosting, he's dismissing her preferences and not respecting her decision, even if it's not what he wanted.\n\nAlso, the author mentions feeling like he wasted money. That's a bit self-centered. A date shouldn't be about expecting a return in terms of physical activity; it's about mutual enjoyment and building a relationship. The fact that he focused on the financial aspect instead of the connection shows a lack of consideration.\n\nHowever, the author might argue that he's being honest about his needs. If he's only interested in a relationship where there's immediate physical intimacy, and she isn't, then maybe he's justified in moving on. But the issue is how he did it. Ghosting is abrupt and inconsiderate. A more respectful approach would be to have an open conversation about differing expectations and part ways amicably.\n\nIn terms of accountability, the author is taking responsibility for his actions but not considering Casey's perspective. He's prioritizing his own desires without acknowledging her right to set her boundaries. So, even though he's not in the wrong for having different expectations, the way he handled the situation is problematic.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because he ghosted her without communication, focused on his own disappointment and expenses, and didn't respect her decision to take things slower. The right approach would be to communicate his feelings and part ways respectfully, even if he's not interested in continuing.\n"
