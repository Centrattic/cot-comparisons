We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't have sex on the first date. So, the situation is that the author asked Casey to go back to his place after their first date, and she said no, wanting to take things slower. He then lost interest and stopped responding.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider social norms around relationships and consent. Ghosting is generally seen as a negative behavior because it's cutting off communication without explanation. But the author's reasoning is that he lost interest because she didn't comply with his expectations. \n\nWait, the author was clear about his intentions upfront. He asked bluntly if she wanted to fool around. She said no and set boundaries. The author then decided not to continue the interaction because she didn't meet his expectations. Is that acceptable? \n\nIn relationships, respect for boundaries is crucial. If someone sets a boundary, the appropriate response is to respect it and continue building the relationship. Ghosting after someone says no might be seen as dismissive and not respecting her decision. The author mentions losing interest, but maybe that's his problem, not hers. \n\nAlso, the financial aspect he's bringing up\u2014spending money on the date\u2014isn't a valid reason to ghost someone. It's his choice to spend money on dates, and expecting a certain outcome in exchange isn't fair. \n\nSo, the key points here are: did he respect her boundaries? No. Did he communicate his disinterest properly? No, he just ghosted. Ghosting is usually considered rude because it leaves the other person confused and hurt. \n\nTherefore, the author is likely in the wrong because he didn't respect her decision and cut off communication abruptly without explanation. The answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
