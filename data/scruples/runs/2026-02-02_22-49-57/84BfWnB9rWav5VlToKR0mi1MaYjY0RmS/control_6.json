We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she refused to have sex on the first date.\n\nFirst, the key points from the scenario: The author and Casey had been flirting for two months, with rumors of her having feelings for him for longer. On their first date, the author directly asked her if they could go back to his place to \"fool around.\" She said no, saying she wasn't comfortable with that yet and wanted things to develop further. The author then lost interest, stopped responding except for minimal replies, and hasn't engaged with her since.\n\nNow, considering social norms and ethics, consent and respect are paramount. The author approached her directly about his intentions, which she declined. The issue here is whether it's acceptable to cut off communication entirely because someone didn't meet his expectations. Ghosting is generally considered rude and dismissive, especially when the person hasn't done anything to warrant such treatment. The author's decision to stop communicating is hurtful and shows a lack of consideration for Casey's feelings and her expressed desire to continue the relationship.\n\nAdditionally, the author's reasoning\u2014loss of interest due to financial cost and unmet expectations\u2014is problematic. It suggests prioritizing personal gain (physical intimacy) over mutual respect and emotional connection. Healthy relationships aren't transactional, and expecting a certain outcome from a first date isn't fair. The author should have respected her boundaries and communicated his feelings rather than abruptly ending contact.\n\nSo, the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because his actions were disrespectful and dismissive of Casey's boundaries and feelings.\n"
