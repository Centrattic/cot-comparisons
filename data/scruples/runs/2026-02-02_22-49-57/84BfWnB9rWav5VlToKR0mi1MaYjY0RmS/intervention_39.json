We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she didn't agree to fool around on the first date. The author knew Casey had a crush for months, went on a date, asked if they wanted to go back to his place, and she said no. Then he lost interest, stopped responding except with minimal replies, and now is wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the perspectives. Ghosting is generally seen as bad because it's abrupt and can leave the other person confused. But the author's reasoning is that he's not interested anymore because she didn't meet his expectations. However, the problem is that he assumed she would be okay with the request, especially after rumors of her having feelings. But she clearly set a boundary by saying no, and he didn't respect that by disengaging instead of having an open conversation. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. If someone says they need time or aren't comfortable with that step yet, the appropriate response would be to discuss it, maybe set expectations for the future, and decide if both parties are on the same page. Ghosting skips that important step, leaving Casey in the dark. Even if the author lost interest, ending things without explanation can be hurtful. \n\nAlso, the author mentions spending a lot of money. That could be a red flag if he's using that as a reason to feel entitled to a sexual encounter. It's important to note that her decision to say no is her right, and the author shouldn't have financial expectations in return. \n\nSo, the answer would lean towards AITA being the author. He's in the wrong because he ghosted someone who set a boundary, didn't communicate his feelings properly, and possibly allowed financial investment to influence his expectations. Even if he's honest about his preferences, the way he ended the interaction is not respectful.\n"
