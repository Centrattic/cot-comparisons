We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she didn't have sex on the first date. The situation is presented through a self-deprecating title like \"AITA for ghosting her after she wouldn't put out?\" which already hints at the author's self-awareness of potential guilt.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical implications. Ghosting, or suddenly cutting off communication, is generally seen as inconsiderate because it leaves the other person confused and without closure. Even if the author lost interest, responding with a thumbs up or \"k\" is dismissive and can be hurtful.\n\nThe author's reasoning is that they were honest about wanting to fool around, thought they had an agreement, and felt disinterested after being rejected. They mention the cost of the date as a factor in their decision. However, the value of a relationship shouldn't be measured purely by financial cost. The author's approach of demanding a specific outcome (sex on the first date) and then devaluing the relationship when it didn't happen might be problematic. It could reflect a transactional view of the relationship, where emotional connection or mutual respect is overshadowed by physical expectations.\n\nCasey's response was to say \"not tonight\" and express that she wants to take things slower, which is a common and reasonable approach. The author's reaction of zoning out and focusing on the financial loss shows a lack of attention to her feelings and the emotional dynamics. This could be seen as disrespectful, especially since they were the ones who initiated the request for intimacy and then became disengaged when it wasn't met.\n\nFrom a societal perspective, many people would argue that pressuring someone for sex on a first date is inappropriate, and respecting her boundaries is essential. The author's decision to ghost instead of having an open conversation about their expectations might be considered the wrong move. A better approach would be to express their feelings maturely and either work through the issue or part ways respectfully, not by cutting off communication entirely.\n\nSo, putting it all together: The author's actions are a form of ghosting, which is ethically questionable. Their reasoning is based on unmet expectations and financial considerations, which don't justify the abrupt and dismissive treatment. Respecting Casey's boundaries and handling the situation with more empathy and communication would be the right approach. Therefore, the answer is that the author is in the wrong.\n"
