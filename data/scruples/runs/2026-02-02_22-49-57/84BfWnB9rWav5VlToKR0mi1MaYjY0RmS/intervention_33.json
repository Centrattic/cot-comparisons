We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who ghosted Casey is in the wrong. The situation is that the author went on a first date with Casey, tried to get intimate, she said no, and then he lost interest and stopped responding. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the social norms around dating and communication. Ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate because it leaves the other person hanging without closure. Even if the author lost interest, cutting off communication abruptly can be hurtful. \n\nThe author approached the topic of intimacy directly on the first date, which Casey declined. Then, he didn't engage in conversation for the rest of the date, leading to a lack of closure. Casey made efforts to reach out afterward, but he ignored her. \n\nFrom a communication standpoint, the author should have expressed his feelings more clearly instead of ghosting. If he wasn't interested in continuing the relationship after her refusal, he could have been honest about that. Ghosting might be seen as a lack of respect for her feelings.\n\nHowever, some might argue that the author has the right to his preferences and that Casey's expectations weren't communicated clearly. But the key issue here is how he handled the end of the interaction. Ghosting is often criticized regardless of the reason because it's dismissive.\n\nSo, considering all that, the author's actions are likely seen as inconsiderate and in the wrong. He should have communicated his disinterest more respectfully instead of cutting off contact. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
