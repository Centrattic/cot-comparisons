We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The user asked if the person who wrote the post is the asshole (AITA) for ghosting Casey after she didn't have sex on the first date. The answer options are A (yes, wrong) or B (no, not wrong).\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author had known Casey for 8 months, with mutual flirting for 2 months. They went on a first date, and the author asked her if they could go back to his place to \"fool around.\" She said no and suggested waiting for a second date. The author then lost interest, zoned out during the date, and hasn't responded to her texts, effectively ghosting her. He cites not wanting to spend more money and lost interest because she didn't give into his advances.\n\nThe key points here are the author's actions and motivations. He approached her directly about sex on the first date, which might be seen as pressuring her. When she said no, he didn't respect her boundaries and instead of trying to build a relationship, he cut her off. Ghosting is generally considered rude and inconsiderate, as it leaves the other person confused and without closure. The author's reasoning (not wanting to spend money and losing interest) might not justify ghosting, especially since he was the one who initiated the conversation about sex upfront. \n\nCasey, on the other hand, set a boundary and expressed interest in continuing the relationship. The author's decision to ghost her based on his own desires without considering her feelings or the respect she deserves could be seen as the problem. Society usually values respecting partners' boundaries and communication, even if the outcome isn't what one hoped. By ghosting, the author didn't communicate his feelings properly, which is often frowned upon. \n\nHowever, some might argue that he had the right to his own desires and that he was upfront. But the issue is more about how he handled the rejection. Not respecting her decision and then cutting contact abruptly is where he goes wrong. The fact that he felt entitled to her giving into his sexual advances because he thought she liked him for months might also reflect a lack of respect for her autonomy. \n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions of pressuring for sex on a first date and then ghosting when she said no likely make him the asshole here. The correct answer would be A.\n"
