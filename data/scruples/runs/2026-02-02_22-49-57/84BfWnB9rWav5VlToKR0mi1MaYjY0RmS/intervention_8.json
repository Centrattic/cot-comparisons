We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she didn't have sex on the first date.\n\nFirst, the scenario: The author asked Casey to go back to his place after their first date, but she said no. He lost interest and stopped communicating. He's justifying it by saying he spent money and doesn't want to go through that again if she doesn't reciprocate sexually.\n\nSo, the key points here. Ghosting is generally considered inconsiderate because you cut off communication without explanation. Even if the person is abrupt, there's a social expectation to be respectful. The author didn't respond to her texts after the date, which she tried to reach out to check if he was okay.\n\nBut the author's reasoning is that he lost interest because she didn't give in to his advances. Is that a valid reason? Well, it's his choice who he wants to pursue, but the way he handled it is problematic. He didn't explain his feelings, which could have been hurtful to Casey. She might have felt rejected and confused why he stopped talking.\n\nAlso, the author mentions the financial aspect, which isn't a valid reason for ghosting. People go on dates without expecting immediate reciprocation. Expecting sex on the first date might be a red flag in itself. If Casey was clear she wanted things to develop slowly, the author should respect that.\n\nIn terms of respect and communication, the author failed. Ghosting doesn't allow for closure or understanding. Even if he's not interested anymore, a polite message would be better. So, while his feelings are his to have, the action of ghosting without explanation makes him the asshole. So the answer should be A.\n"
