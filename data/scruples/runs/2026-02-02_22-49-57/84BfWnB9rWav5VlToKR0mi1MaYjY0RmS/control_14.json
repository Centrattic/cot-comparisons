We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't have sex on the first date. First, I need to understand the scenario fully.\n\nThe author set up a date with Casey, they were flirting for a while, and she had a crush on him. On the first date, he asked her if they could go back to his place to \"fool around.\" She said no, said she wasn't like that, mentioned she likes him but wants things to develop. The author then lost interest, didn't respond to her texts, and ghosted her. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about consent, respect, and communication. The author approached the situation by being direct, which is honest, but maybe too direct. Pressuring someone for sex on the first date isn't appropriate, regardless of how long they've known each other. He assumed she'd say yes because of the rumors and his own expectations, but she clearly set a boundary. Instead of respecting her decision and moving forward, he decided to ghost her because he lost interest. That's where the problem is.\n\nIn healthy relationships, respect for a person's boundaries is crucial. Even if he felt disappointed, cutting her off without communication isn't right. Ghosting can be hurtful, and he's using his feelings of rejection as a reason to avoid her, but that doesn't justify being dismissive. Also, he's focusing on the money spent, which adds a transactional aspect that's not respectful. He should have considered her feelings and communicated his own rather than just disappearing.\n\nSo, even though he's honest about his intentions, the way he handled the rejection isn't okay. The answer here is that he is in the wrong because he didn't respect her decision and chose to ghost instead of being upfront about his feelings. The correct choice would be A.\n"
