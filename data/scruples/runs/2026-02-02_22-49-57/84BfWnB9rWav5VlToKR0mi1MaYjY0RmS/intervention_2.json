We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. So the user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't have sex on the first date. The scenario is presented in a Reddit-style \"Am I the Asshole\" format. \n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The author set up a date, asked directly if they could fool around, and the other person said \"no, not tonight.\" The author then lost interest and stopped responding, hence ghosting.\n\nThe user initially thought the author isn't in the wrong but wants my opinion. I have to decide between A (yes, in the wrong) or B (no). \n\nLet me break down the key points. The author was honest about wanting to have sex, which is okay. The other person clearly communicated boundaries, which is her right. The author then reacted by losing interest and cutting off communication. Ghosting is generally considered rude and inconsiderate because it leaves the other person without closure. Even if the author felt disappointed, not responding to texts and abrupt disengagement is poor communication. The author's reasoning is about losing interest due to the refusal and wanting not to invest more without the possibility of sex, but that doesn't justify ghosting. Respecting someone's boundaries even if it doesn't meet personal expectations is important. So the wrong here is the ghosting, not necessarily the loss of interest. The author is inconsiderate in how they handled the rejection, even if the rejection itself isn't the issue. So the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
