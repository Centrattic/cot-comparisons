We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't have sex on the first date. The question is whether the author's actions make them the asshole.\n\nFirst, the author approached Casey after knowing her for 8 months and flirting for 2. They had their first date, which included dinner and a movie. The author then asked bluntly if they could go back to his place for sex. Casey said no, and said she wasn't \"that\" person, but mentioned she likes him and wants things to develop. The author then lost interest, stopped responding, and is ghosting her.\n\nI need to consider social norms here. Ghosting is generally frowned upon because it's abrupt and can leave the other person confused or hurt. However, the author is being honest about his intentions. He was looking for a physical relationship and when it didn't happen, he lost interest. On the other hand, Casey wanted a slower, more emotional connection. The author didn't have to ask for sex, and maybe he should have considered her feelings more. But he also has the right to pursue the type of relationship he wants. \n\nIs it wrong to ghost? If he's upfront about not wanting to continue, maybe not. But ghosting is still seen as inconsiderate. The author could have communicated better instead of cutting off contact. However, he's not lying or leading her on. The key is whether he had a responsibility to stay in touch even though he wasn't interested. \n\nI think the answer is a bit nuanced. While the author isn't wrong for losing interest, the way he handled it by ghosting is where the issue is. So he is the asshole for not being respectful in ending the interaction. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
