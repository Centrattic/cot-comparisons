We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting the girl after she didn't have sex on the first date. The story is from an \"Am I the Asshole?\" kind of context.\n\nFirst, the author asked directly if they wanted to go back to his place to \"fool around.\" She said no, not tonight, and mentioned they should let things develop. The author then lost interest, stopped responding, and just gives minimal replies like thumbs up or \"k.\" He's justifying it by saying he spent money on the date and doesn't see the point of continuing if she won't sleep with him.\n\nHmm. Well, in terms of what's considered acceptable behavior, ghosting someone after they declined a sexual advance is a bit of a gray area. The author is being honest about his intentions upfront, which is good. He told her he wanted to have sex, and she said no. But the problem is that he's treating her refusal as a deal-breaker. That's where the issue might lie. \n\nIn many social contexts, respecting someone's boundaries is crucial. Even if you're not interested in continuing the relationship, you don't have to be rude or ghost them. The author could have been honest about his feelings, explained that he wasn't interested in continuing because she didn't meet his expectations, and then moved on. Ghosting is often seen as inconsiderate because it leaves the other person confused and unacknowledged. \n\nAlso, the author mentions he's not in a relationship, but that's not the main point here. The main issue is his reaction to her refusal. It's his choice to not want to pursue a non-sexual relationship, but cutting off communication entirely without explanation can be hurtful. \n\nSo, even though the author was upfront about his intentions, the act of ghosting is generally considered rude. Therefore, he might be the asshole because he didn't communicate his disinterest properly and left her hanging. The fact that he's responding with minimal replies instead of a clear conversation makes it worse. \n\nBut then again, if he truly lost interest and doesn't want to engage further, maybe it's not entirely his fault. However, the expectation in many cultures is to communicate clearly, even if you don't want to continue. So, the answer might lean towards A (he's in the wrong) because of the ghosting and not providing closure.\n"
