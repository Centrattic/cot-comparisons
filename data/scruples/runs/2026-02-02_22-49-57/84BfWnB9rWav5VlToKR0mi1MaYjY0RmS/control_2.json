We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she didn't have sex on the first date. So, the scenario is that they've been flirting for two months, knew Casey had a crush for months. Went on the first date, the guy asked if she wanted to go back to his place to \"fool around,\" she said no and said to wait until the second date. He then lost interest, didn't respond properly, and ghosted her.\n\nHmm. First, the author admitted he was honest and laid all his cards on the table. He thought he had a \"done deal,\" but she said no. Then he zoned out during the rest of the date, and after that, he stopped responding except with minimal replies. He cites losing interest because she didn't have sex on the first date and not wanting to waste money again if she doesn't do it on the second date.\n\nNow, the question is whether he's in the wrong. Well, consent and respect are key here. If she made it clear she wasn't interested in physical intimacy yet, the author's decision to ghost her because she didn't comply is problematic. Even if he thought he had a \"done deal,\" respecting her boundaries is essential. Ghosting after that could be seen as dismissive and disrespectful. Also, using the excuse that he wasted money is a bit self-centered. She had the right to say no, and his reaction of cutting her off is more about his own expectations than her comfort or autonomy.\n\nBut maybe he felt disrespected? However, the way he approached it by asking bluntly might have set the wrong tone. Approaching a date with the intention of immediate physical intimacy might not consider the other person's pace. She wanted to take things slower, and he decided to end the relationship because of that. So, in that case, he's being the asshole for not respecting her wishes and his own priorities conflicting with her boundaries.\n\nSo, I think the answer is A (Yes, he's in the wrong). He didn't respect her decision to wait, and ghosting is a cruel way to handle it. Plus, using the money as a justification is a bit of an excuse.\n"
