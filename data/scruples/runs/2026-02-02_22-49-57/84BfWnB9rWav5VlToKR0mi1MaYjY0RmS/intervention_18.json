We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she said no on the first date. The author was upfront about wanting to hook up, Casey said no and wanted to take it slow, and the author lost interest and stopped responding.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context of their situation. The author approached Casey, who he knew had a crush on him, and asked her directly if they could fool around. She declined, thinking they could build a relationship first. The author then ghosted her, not responding to her texts. \n\nNow, the main question is whether this ghosting makes the author the asshole. Let's think about consent and respect. The author respected her initial no by not pushing further that night. However, ghosting after that might be seen as dismissive. People have different expectations, but communication is key. The author's reasoning is that he lost interest because he expected physical intimacy and didn't want to invest more time or money if it didn't happen again. \n\nBut is it fair to expect sex on a first date? Some people might, others not. However, even if he expected it, she said no, and he chose to end the interaction abruptly. Ghosting can be hurtful because it leaves the other person confused and without closure. While the author felt he had no reason to continue, it's possible that Casey valued their connection beyond just the physical aspect. \n\nAlso, the mention of money spent might be a red flag. If his primary motivation was seeing her as a \"score\" rather than a genuine connection, that's problematic. Ghosting because of the financial aspect could be seen as selfish. \n\nIn terms of ethics, even if the author didn't act with malicious intent, his actions still caused distress. Clear communication would be better than ghosting. He could have explained his feelings instead of cutting off contact. \n\nSo, while the author might feel justified in his decision, from an ethical standpoint, cutting off communication without explanation and not considering her feelings could make him the asshole. Therefore, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong).\n"
