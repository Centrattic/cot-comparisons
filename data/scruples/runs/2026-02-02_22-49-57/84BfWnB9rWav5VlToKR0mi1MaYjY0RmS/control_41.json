We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't sleep with him on the first date. So, first, let's look at the situation.\n\nThe author and Casey have been flirting for two months, with rumors of her having feelings for him for longer. They went on their first date, which included a movie and dinner. The author was direct and asked if they could go back to his place to \"fool around,\" which she declined, saying she wasn't \"like that\" and wanted to take things slower. The author then lost interest, stopped responding, and now is just giving short replies. He's justifying this by saying he spent money and doesn't want to keep investing if there's a risk of not getting what he wants.\n\nHmm. The key points here are communication, respect, and expectations. The author was honest about his intentions, which is good. But he expected her to comply with his request, which she didn't. However, she did express interest in continuing to get to know him, wanting to take things to the second date. The author, on the other hand, lost interest because she didn't meet his immediate needs. \n\nNow, considering social norms and healthy relationships, people have different boundaries and expectations. The author's approach might be seen as transactional\u2014he's treating the relationship as a means to an end (physical intimacy) rather than valuing the connection itself. Ghosting after a single refusal could be considered dismissive and disrespectful, especially since she was clear that she wanted to continue building the relationship. \n\nAlso, the mention of money might indicate that he viewed the date as an investment for a potential reward, which isn't a healthy perspective. If someone is only interested in a relationship if it leads to immediate physical intimacy, and they lose interest when that doesn't happen, that's a personal choice, but it's not necessarily considerate of the other person's boundaries. \n\nOn the flip side, the author isn't obligated to continue interacting if he's disinterested. However, the way he's handling it\u2014ghosting and cutting off communication\u2014without a clear explanation or respect for her feelings could be hurtful. She's made effort to reach out, and his lack of response might be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nIn many cultures, it's considered respectful to communicate openly about such things. If the author had said he was only interested in a physical relationship and she wasn't, that's his prerogative, but then he should communicate that clearly instead of leading her on. Alternatively, if he's not willing to engage in a relationship that requires mutual respect and emotional connection, then his actions here might be seen as the asshole move.\n\nSo, the author is in the wrong because he's prioritizing his own desires over her boundaries, and his ghosting is a form of emotional manipulation without a proper explanation. He's treating her as a means to an end and then cutting her off when that end isn't met, which isn't respectful.\n"
