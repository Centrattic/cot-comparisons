We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she refused to have sex on the first date. The situation is that the author asked her bluntly during the date, expecting her to agree based on the rumors of her having a crush. But she said no, and he then lost interest, stopped responding, and now is just giving minimal responses. He justifies it by saying he didn't want to waste more money and lost interest. \n\nFirst, I need to evaluate the key points here. The author approached the date with the intention of moving towards a physical relationship quickly, which Casey wasn't comfortable with. She made it clear she wanted things to develop more slowly. The author, instead of respecting her boundaries and trying to build a connection, became disinterested and ghosted her. \n\nGhosting is generally considered rude and inconsiderate, regardless of the reasons. The author's actions show a lack of respect for her feelings and autonomy. He assumed she was \"an easy sell\" because of rumors, which is problematic. It's important to recognize that people have the right to set their own boundaries, and pressuring someone for sex, even if they seem interested in other ways, is not acceptable. \n\nAdditionally, the author's focus on the money spent on the date as a reason to cut off communication is selfish. The cost shouldn't dictate the value of a relationship. Relationships should be about mutual respect and connection, not transactional thinking. \n\nOn the other hand, if the author is being honest about his needs, it's true that people have different expectations. However, the way he handled it\u2014by ghosting instead of communicating\u2014was wrong. He didn't give her a chance to explain further or to build a relationship beyond physical aspects. \n\nIn conclusion, while the author might have felt disappointed, his response was unkind and disrespectful. He should have communicated his feelings more maturely instead of cutting her off abruptly. Therefore, the answer is A.\n"
