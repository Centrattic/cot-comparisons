We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't have sex on the first date. The situation is presented through an AITA (Am I the Asshole?) forum style post.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author and Casey have known each other for 8 months, with flirting for 2 months. Rumors suggest Casey had a crush for 5-6 months. They had their first date, which included a movie and dinner. The author directly asked if they could go back to his place to \"fool around,\" which Casey declined, saying she wasn't \"like that\" and wanted to take things slower. The author then lost interest, stopped responding beyond minimal replies, and now is wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nSo, the author's main justification is that he lost interest because she didn't give him what he wanted on the first date. He mentions the money spent on the date as a factor. The key issue here is whether it's acceptable to ghost someone for not meeting his physical expectations after a first date.\n\nFrom a relationship and social interaction perspective, respect and communication are important. The author was upfront about his intentions, which is good, but Casey had different boundaries. The problem here is that the author seems to have valued the physical aspect highly over the emotional connection or mutual respect. Ghosting, which is cutting off communication without explanation, is generally considered rude and inconsiderate.\n\nThe author's actions could be seen as dismissive of Casey's boundaries and feelings. Even if he felt disappointed, the appropriate response would be to communicate his feelings honestly, perhaps express that he's looking for a more immediate physical relationship, and part ways amicably if that's not what she wants. Instead, he chose to ignore her texts and avoid further interaction, which can hurt the other person and is often viewed as inconsiderate.\n\nAdditionally, the author mentions the money spent as a factor. While it's understandable to feel that money was wasted, it's not a valid reason to ghost someone. Expecting a sexual encounter on the first date isn't a given in all relationships, and people have different expectations. The author's focus on the financial aspect might indicate a transactional view of the date, which isn't healthy.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally accepted that people have different comfort levels and boundaries. Respecting those boundaries is key. The author's decision to end the interaction abruptly without considering Casey's perspective shows a lack of respect for her autonomy and feelings. Therefore, the author is likely in the wrong for ghosting instead of having an open conversation about his expectations and the mismatch in their desires.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
