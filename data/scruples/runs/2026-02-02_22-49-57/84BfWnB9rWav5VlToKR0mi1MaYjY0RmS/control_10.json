We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author did something wrong by ghosting Casey after she didn't sleep with him on the first date.\n\nFirst, the author approached Casey and asked her directly if she wanted to go back to his place to \"fool around.\" She declined, saying she wasn't \"like that\" and wanted things to develop on a second date. The author then lost interest, didn't respond to her texts, and ghosted her. He mentions he's not doing it to hurt her but because he lost interest after spending money on the date and not getting what he wanted.\n\nSo, the key points here are: Did the author act improperly? From a social standpoint, pressuring someone for physical intimacy on a first date is often frowned upon. The author was upfront about his intentions, which might have set the wrong expectations. When she declined, his reaction was to disengage completely. That's considered ghosting, which is generally seen as inconsiderate and hurtful, regardless of the reason. The author's justification\u2014losing interest because she didn't comply\u2014doesn't excuse the behavior. Relationships should be based on mutual respect and emotional connection, not transactions or conditional interest. The fact that he focused on the money spent also suggests a lack of respect for her boundaries and feelings. So, yes, the author is in the wrong. Answer A.\n"
