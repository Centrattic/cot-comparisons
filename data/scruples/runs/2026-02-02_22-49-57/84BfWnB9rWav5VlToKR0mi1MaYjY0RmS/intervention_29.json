We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't have sex on the first date. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the scenario. The author met Casey, they were flirting for a while, went on a first date. He asked her to go back to his place to \"fool around,\" she said no and suggested waiting for the second date. He lost interest and hasn't responded to her texts, essentially ghosting her. The author says he's not trying to hurt her, just that he lost interest because he expected a physical relationship and she didn't meet his expectations.\n\nNow, considering social norms and ethical perspectives. Ghosting is generally frowned upon because it can be hurtful and dismissive. People have different expectations; some might find it reasonable to lose interest if their expectations aren't met, but others would argue that it's not fair to end communication abruptly without explanation.\n\nThe author's actions are based on his own desires and expectations. However, he didn't respect her boundaries and then ignored her attempts to communicate. Even if he felt disappointed, cutting off communication without addressing the issue could be seen as inconsiderate. Also, the fact that he focused on the money spent on the date might indicate he valued the interaction more in terms of personal gain rather than mutual respect.\n\nFrom a moral standpoint, respecting someone's decision and boundaries is important. Even if you're disappointed, disappearing without explanation can leave the other person confused and hurt. The key point is whether the author's actions were considerate of Casey's feelings and clear communication. Since he chose to ghost instead of having an honest conversation about his feelings, that could be seen as inconsiderate.\n\nSo, while the author might feel justified in his actions, the ethical evaluation leans towards him being in the wrong because he didn't communicate his feelings properly and dismissed her attempts to reach out, which is unkind regardless of his personal reasons.\n"
