We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation involves ghosting after the first date when the other person didn't agree to have sex. The writer admits they lost interest because they weren't interested in continuing without sex.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethical aspects. Ghosting is generally considered rude because it cuts off communication without explanation. The person Casey is trying to reach out, but the author is ignoring her. That's inconsiderate. Also, the author mentions that Casey had a crush for months, and he thought he had a \"done deal,\" which might show a lack of respect for her boundaries. \n\nHe decided to ask for sex on the first date, which is a personal choice, but it's not uncommon for people to want to build a relationship first. Casey's response was that she wasn't like that and wanted things to develop. The author then lost interest, which might indicate that his primary interest was in physical intimacy rather than a relationship. \n\nGhosting can be hurtful because it leaves the other person confused. Even if the author isn't in the wrong for losing interest, the way he's handling the situation\u2014ignoring her texts and not explaining\u2014is problematic. There's also the mention of money, but that's not a valid reason to ghost someone. \n\nSo, the key points are: Ghosting is rude, not respecting her boundary by expecting sex on the first date, and not communicating properly. The author's actions may not be illegal, but socially and ethically, he's being inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer is likely A, he's in the wrong.\n"
