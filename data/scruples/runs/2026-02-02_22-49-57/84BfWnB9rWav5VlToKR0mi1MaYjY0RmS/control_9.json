We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she didn't have sex on the first date. So, first, I need to analyze the situation based on what's described.\n\nThe author and Casey have been flirting for two months, and there were rumors she had feelings for him for 5-6 months. They went on a first date where he asked her directly if they could go back to his place to \"fool around.\" She said \"no, not tonight\" and wanted to take things slower. The author then lost interest, stopped responding beyond minimal replies, and hasn't engaged with her since. The key points here are communication, respect, and expectations.\n\nHe admits to being honest and putting his cards on the table. However, he expected a certain outcome and was disappointed when she didn't comply. He then ghosted her. Now, the question is whether he's in the wrong. \n\nFrom a relationship ethics perspective, if someone clearly communicates their boundaries and the other person respects that, it's a healthy interaction. But if someone ghosts someone else after they don't meet their expectations, that's considered rude. The author didn't communicate his feelings clearly after her rejection; instead, he disengaged completely. He also mentions being upset about the money spent, which introduces transactional thinking, which is generally frowned upon. \n\nThe key issue here is whether the author respected Casey's boundaries. By asking bluntly and getting a clear \"no,\" he was told to stop. If he couldn't handle that and decided to cut her off without explaining, that's inconsiderate. Ghosting is typically seen as a disrespectful way to end communication, especially if the person had expressed interest in continuing the relationship but just had different boundaries. \n\nThe author's justification is that he lost interest, but that's his opinion. However, the way he went about ending contact is problematic. He didn't give her closure or explain his feelings, which is the mature thing to do. So, considering all that, the author is likely in the wrong because he didn't respect her decision and ended the interaction abruptly without communication.\n"
