We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting after the girl didn't agree to have sex on the first date. The author says they asked her directly if they could fool around, and she said no, then he lost interest and stopped responding.\n\nHmm. First, I need to consider the ethical aspects here. Ghosting someone is generally seen as inconsiderate because it leaves the other person confused and without closure. Even if the motivation is losing interest, it's abrupt and can be hurtful. The author mentioned that he didn't want to waste money or time on a second date if there's a chance she might say no again. But is that a valid reason to ghost?\n\nThe author was upfront about his intentions, which is good. But when she said no, he didn't engage in further conversation or express his feelings. Instead, he shut down the communication. The girl made overtures to reach out after, but he ignored them. That's where the issue lies. Even if you lose interest, it's better to communicate that respectfully rather than disappearing.\n\nAlso, the fact that he thought it was an \"easy sell\" might indicate he approached the situation with the wrong mindset, focusing more on getting what he wanted rather than building a relationship. Respecting someone's boundaries is important. If she set a boundary, and he respected it initially but then stopped communicating, that's not the best way to handle things. Maybe he could have said he wasn't interested in continuing and why, instead of ghosting.\n\nSo, while the author's actions come from a place of personal disappointment, the act of ghosting is considered rude and inconsiderate. Therefore, he might be in the wrong for not handling the situation with more transparency and respect towards her feelings, even if he didn't want to continue the relationship.\n"
