We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting someone because she didn't sleep with him on the first date. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: They've known each other for 8 months, been flirting for 2 months. The guy asks her on a date, and during dinner, he asks if they can go back to his place to fool around. She says no, wants to take things slower. He then loses interest, stops responding, and ghosting her. He mentions not wanting to spend money again if she might say no again.\n\nSo, the key points here. Ghosting isn't really okay in most people's books. Even if you lose interest, cutting off communication without explanation can be hurtful. The guy is being pretty upfront about his intentions, which is his choice, but expecting a sexual encounter on the first date isn't necessarily wrong for him, but when the other person says no, his reaction is to just drop all contact. That seems harsh. \n\nAlso, the fact that he's focusing on the money he spent might be a red flag. Using finances as a reason to cut someone off isn't the healthiest mindset. Relationships shouldn't be transactional. He's treating her like a transaction where she's supposed to give him something (sex) in exchange for his time and money, which isn't fair.\n\nAnother angle: He was honest about his intentions, which is good, but he didn't respect her boundaries when she said no. Respecting someone's decision to take things slower is important. If he can't accept that, maybe he's not looking for a genuine connection. Ghosting her because she didn't meet his expectations might show a lack of maturity in handling rejection.\n\nBut then again, some people might argue that if you're not interested in a slow-burn relationship, it's okay to move on. However, the way he's ghosting her without explanation is where the problem lies. A better approach would be to have a conversation, maybe explain that he's looking for something different, but not just vanish. \n\nSo, putting it all together: The author is being dismissive and not respecting the other person's feelings by ghosting. He's also showing a transactional attitude towards the date. Therefore, he's in the wrong. The answer is A.\n"
