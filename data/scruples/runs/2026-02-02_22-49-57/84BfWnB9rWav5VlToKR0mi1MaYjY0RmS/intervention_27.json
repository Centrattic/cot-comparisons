We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

He asked her to go back to his place to fool around during their first date, and she said \"no, not tonight.\" She mentioned that she likes him and wants things to develop over a second date. He thought he had a \"done deal\" because she had a crush on him for months, but she turned him down. He felt awkward, zoned out during the rest of the date, and after that, he didn't respond to her texts except with minimal replies. Now he's wondering if he's the asshole for ghosting her because she didn't sleep with him on the first date.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but they want to know if I agree. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, communication is key in relationships. The guy was honest about what he wanted, which is good. But he approached it by asking her bluntly if she wanted to go back to his place. Maybe he didn't leave room for her to express her boundaries. She said no, and he lost interest because he was focused on his own expectations. \n\nGhosting someone, which means suddenly cutting off all communication, is generally considered disrespectful. Even if he lost interest, he could have been polite and explained that he wasn't interested in moving forward. Instead, he just stopped responding, which might hurt her feelings. She was interested in continuing the relationship, as shown by her texts after the date. \n\nHe also mentions the money he spent on the date. Prioritizing money over her feelings might not be the healthiest mindset. The fact that he's using the cost as a reason to cut her off could indicate that he's more focused on his own loss than her comfort and consent. Respecting her decision, even if it wasn't what he wanted, is important. \n\nSo, while he's not the only one at fault\u2014because she did say no and he had his expectations\u2014he should have handled the situation better. Ghosting is a poor way to deal with rejection. He should have communicated his lack of interest respectfully. Therefore, the author is in the wrong for ghosting her instead of being honest and respectful about his feelings and her boundaries.\n"
