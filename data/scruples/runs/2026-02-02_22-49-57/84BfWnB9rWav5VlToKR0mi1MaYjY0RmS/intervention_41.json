We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she didn't agree to fool around on the first date. The author mentions they had known Casey for 8 months, flirted for about 2, and there were rumors she had feelings. On the first date, he was direct and asked if she wanted to go back to his place, and she said no. Then he zoned out, and after that, he stopped responding, which is ghosting.\n\nSo, the key points here. First, the author was honest but maybe too direct. Asking bluntly if she wants to \"fool around\" might have come off as pressure. Then, when she said no, he lost interest and ghosted. The question is about whether that's wrong.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally considered respectful to honor someone's boundaries. If she clearly set a boundary by saying no, then the author's reaction of ghosting could be seen as dismissive or not respecting her wishes. Ghosting is usually frowned upon because it's abrupt and leaves the other person hanging. Even if the author felt disinterested, he could have communicated that more clearly instead of cutting off all contact.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning is about not wanting to waste money on further dates if there's a risk of not getting physical. That seems self-centered and transactional. Relationships should be based on mutual respect and connection, not just on the expectation of physical intimacy. The fact that he thought it was an \"easy sell\" because of the rumors and her supposed crush also shows a lack of consideration for her actual consent and comfort level.\n\nSo, the author didn't handle the situation well. Even if he felt rejected, the right approach would be to express his feelings without pressuring her and then decide if he can move forward without that. Ghosting is typically the asshole move because it's disrespectful to the other person's feelings and time. Therefore, the answer would be A, the author is in the wrong.\n"
