We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she didn't sleep with him on the first date. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author set up a date, asked her directly if they could \"fool around\" during dinner. She said no, but mentioned she likes him and wants things to develop. He then lost interest, stopped engaging during the date, and hasn't responded properly since.\n\nHmm, so the key points are: he asked for sex on the first date, she declined but showed interest in continuing, and he ghosted her. Now, the question is whether he's wrong for doing that. \n\nI remember that in many cultures, especially in dating norms, pressuring for sex on a first date is often seen as inappropriate. Even if both people are interested, there's usually an expectation of building a connection first. The fact that he was \"putting all his cards on the table\" might be seen as too forward. But the user's argument is that he's not in the wrong because he lost interest when she didn't comply. \n\nBut wait, consent and mutual interest are crucial. If someone isn't comfortable with moving that quickly, it's important to respect their boundaries. Ghosting might not be the best approach, but is he in the wrong for losing interest? Maybe not, but the way he handled it could be problematic. \n\nHowever, another angle: he was honest about his intentions. If he was clear from the start that he wanted to have sex and she wasn't interested, then he might feel like there's no future. But is it fair to ghost? People have different standards, but cutting off communication entirely without explanation can be hurtful. \n\nAlso, the author mentions he didn't respond to her texts, just minimal replies. Ghosting is generally frowned upon because it leaves the other person confused and without closure. Even if he lost interest, a polite explanation might have been better. \n\nBut the user's stance is that the author isn't wrong because he was honest. The user might see it as a case of mismatched expectations. The author's actions were based on his own desires and the lack of alignment with hers. \n\nI need to consider societal standards. In many places, expecting physical intimacy on the first date isn't the norm, so the author's request could be seen as too aggressive. But if both parties were okay with that, it's a personal choice. However, the woman clearly stated she wasn't interested in that on the first date, so the author's reaction of ghosting could be seen as dismissive of her boundaries. \n\nBut the question is whether he's in the wrong. The answer depends on perspective. If the problem is that he asked for sex on the first date, then he's partly at fault. If the issue is ghosting after a decline, that's another. \n\nIn the AITA context, people often judge based on whether actions were respectful. Ghosting is usually considered rude, but if his intentions were clear from the start, maybe it's more of a mismatch. However, asking for sex on the first date can be seen as crossing a boundary. \n\nSo, putting it all together: the author asked for sex too early, she said no, he lost interest, and then ghosted. The wrongness might lie in both the initial request and the ghosting. But the user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. \n\nI think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't respect her boundaries and chose to ghost instead of communicating. Even if he lost interest, there's a better way to handle it without cutting her off abruptly. The request for sex on the first date might also be seen as inappropriate, contributing to the problem.\n"
