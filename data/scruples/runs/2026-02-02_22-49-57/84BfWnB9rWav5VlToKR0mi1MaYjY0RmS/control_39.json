We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't have sex on the first date. \n\nFirst, the situation: The author and Casey had been flirting for two months, with rumors of her having a crush for 5-6 months. On their first date, he asked her directly if they could go back to his place to \"fool around.\" She said no, not tonight, and said they should take things slower. He then lost interest, didn't respond to her texts, and basically ghosted her.\n\nNow, considering the ethical aspects. Ghosting is generally considered rude because it cuts off communication abruptly without explanation. The author admits he lost interest because she didn't comply with his expectations for physical intimacy on the first date. That suggests he was only interested in a sexual relationship and wasn't respecting her boundaries or desire to take things slowly. \n\nRespecting someone's consent and boundaries is crucial. By pressuring her for sex on the first date and then cutting her off when she said no, he's showing a lack of respect for her autonomy. The fact that he's focusing on the money spent on the date rather than her feelings also points to a transactional mindset, which isn't healthy in a relationship. \n\nAdditionally, the author's actions could be seen as dismissive and hurtful. Ghosting doesn't give the other person closure, which can be emotionally damaging. Even if the author felt disinterested, a mature approach would be to have an honest conversation about his feelings, even if it's uncomfortable. \n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions are inconsiderate and disrespectful. He's prioritizing his own desires and financial concerns over her comfort and the potential for a respectful relationship. Therefore, he is in the wrong.\n"
