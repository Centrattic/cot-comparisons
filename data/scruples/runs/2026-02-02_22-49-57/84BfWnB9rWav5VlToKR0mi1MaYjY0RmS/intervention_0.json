We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she didn't have sex that first date. The author's question is whether they are the asshole (AITA) for doing so. The user thinks the author isn't wrong, but wants confirmation.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author had been flirting with Casey for two months, knew she had a crush for several months, and they went on a first date. He asked her directly if she wanted to have sex, she said no, and he lost interest, so he stopped responding. \n\nGhosting is when you cut off all communication without explanation. The author is being asked if that's wrong. The key points here are consent, expectations, and communication. The author approached the date with the expectation of sexual activity, which he explicitly asked for. Casey set a boundary, saying no to sex. The author then decided to ghost her, feeling it wasn't worth the time or money if she didn't give in. \n\nFrom a moral standpoint, respecting someone's boundaries is crucial. Even if the author thought it was a \"done deal\" because of rumors of a crush, that's not a valid reason to assume consent. Pressuring someone for sex after the first date is a red flag. Ghosting might be hurtful, but if he's not interested in continuing the relationship due to her refusal, he might feel he has no obligation. However, the way he handled it is problematic. \n\nHe didn't communicate his feelings, instead just cutting off contact. That's disrespectful to Casey. She tried to keep in touch, but he ignored her. Also, his reasoning is based on wanting a transactional outcome (sex) and feeling it's not worth the investment otherwise. That's more about his own expectations and not considering her autonomy. \n\nSo, the author is in the wrong for ghosting without explanation and for valuing the date's outcome in a way that's not healthy. The answer should be A, but I need to check if the user's reasoning is sound. The user argues the author isn't wrong, but most perspectives would say that ghosting is rude and the author shouldn't have pressured her for sex. Therefore, the correct answer is A.\n"
