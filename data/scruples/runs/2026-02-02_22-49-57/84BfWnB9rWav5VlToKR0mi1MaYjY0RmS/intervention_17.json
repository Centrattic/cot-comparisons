We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong. The scenario is that they went on a first date with Casey, asked her to go back to his place, she said no, and then he lost interest and ghosted her. He's questioning if he's the asshole for doing that.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the dynamics here. The author was honest about his intentions upfront. He asked her directly if they could fool around, which he felt was a done deal because she had a crush on him. She declined and wanted to take things slower. He then lost interest and stopped communicating, which is ghosting.\n\nHmm, so from a relationship perspective, respect is key. Even if someone doesn't meet your expectations, it's important to treat them with respect. Ghosting can be hurtful because it leaves the other person without closure. Casey tried to reach out after, but he ignored her. \n\nBut the author's reasoning is that he lost interest and didn't want to invest more time or money without getting what he wanted. Is it wrong to prioritize his own needs? Well, maybe not in terms of his own feelings, but the way he handled it. Ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate. Even if he's not interested anymore, a simple explanation would be better than cutting off completely.\n\nAlso, the pressure he put on her on the first date might be a problem. Expecting physical intimacy so quickly could be too much for some people. She wanted to take things slow, and he might have misread her signals. But he's not wrong for having those desires, just maybe for how he handled the rejection.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The act of ghosting after rejection could be seen as the problem here. While he's not wrong for losing interest, the way he cut her off without communication might make him the asshole. People often expect some level of respect even if they want to end things. Therefore, the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because of the ghosting and lack of communication.\n"
