We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so the user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she didn't sleep with him on the first date. The author mentioned they've known Casey for 8 months, had been flirting for 2, and there were rumors she had feelings. On the first date, he asked her directly if they could \"fool around\" and she said no. He then lost interest, stopped responding, and only gives minimal replies now.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the situation. The key point here is the author's decision to ghost Casey because she declined his immediate sexual proposition. The user says they think the author isn't in the wrong, but wants my opinion. \n\nLet me break it down. The author approached the date with the expectation of having sex on the first date, which Casey didn't fulfill. He then decided to cut off communication. Is that acceptable? Well, in dating, mutual respect and understanding each other's boundaries are crucial. If the author made a direct approach for sexual activity and Casey said no, then it's her right to set that boundary. Ghosting her in response could be seen as disrespectful. People have different comfort levels and expectations, and the author might have misread the signals by assuming an easy yes. \n\nAlso, the author mentions they've been flirting for two months and there were rumors about her feelings. However, just because there were rumors or prior flirting doesn't mean she's obligated to meet his expectations. The fact that he felt his interest waned immediately after the rejection is a personal choice, but ghosting can be harmful as it leaves the other person confused and without closure. \n\nThe user's reasoning is that the author isn't in the wrong, but I need to consider if that's valid. The author's actions were based on his own expectations, but respecting Casey's decision is important. Not replying to her messages is ghosting, which is generally considered a negative behavior in relationships. Even if the author changed his mind, he could have communicated that instead of disappearing. \n\nSo, while the author isn't necessarily trying to hurt her, his approach and lack of follow-up communication make him the asshole. The correct answer would be A.\n"
