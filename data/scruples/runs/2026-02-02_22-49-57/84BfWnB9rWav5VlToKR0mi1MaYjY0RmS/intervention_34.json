We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person in the scenario is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't sleep with him on the first date. The person claims he asked her directly if they could fool around, she said no, and then he lost interest, so he stopped responding. He also mentions he spent money on the date and doesn't want to invest more time or money if there's a chance of not getting what he wants.\n\nHmm, so the key points here are: he asked her bluntly about physical intimacy, she declined, and then he ghosted her. He's not responding to her texts now. The question is whether he's in the wrong.\n\nFirst, I need to consider consent and respect. Asking directly is okay, but pressuring someone for sex is not. However, she said no, and he respected her decision by not pushing further. But then he ghosted her. Ghosting is generally considered rude and inconsiderate, regardless of the reason. It's cutting off communication without explanation, which can leave the other person confused and hurt.\n\nHe mentions he's not trying to hurt her, just that he lost interest. But the problem with ghosting is that it's abrupt and doesn't allow for closure. Even if he's not interested anymore, a respectful approach would be to explain that he's not interested in continuing, rather than just disappearing. So, from a social standpoint, ghosting is usually frowned upon.\n\nAlso, his reasoning is that he's not willing to invest more time and money if there's no sexual outcome. That seems transactional and disrespectful. Relationships shouldn't be viewed as a cost-benefit analysis where physical intimacy is the reward. Expecting someone to provide value (like a nice date) only for personal gain (sex) can be problematic. If that's his main goal, it's not fair to the other person.\n\nAnother angle: he admitted he zoned out during the date after her refusal, which shows he wasn't present or engaged. That's a red flag for inconsiderate behavior. Then, after the date, he didn't respond appropriately, just gave a limp hug. That's dismissive.\n\nSo, putting it all together, while he might feel justified in his actions, the way he handled it\u2014ghosting, not communicating, expecting sex as a result of his \"investment\"\u2014is inconsiderate and disrespectful. Therefore, the answer would be that he's in the wrong.\n"
