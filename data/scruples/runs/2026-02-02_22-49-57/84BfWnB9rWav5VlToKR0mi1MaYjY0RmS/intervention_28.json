We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the person who wrote the \"AITA\" (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't sleep with him on the first date. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the scenario. The writer, let's call him Alex, asked Casey directly if she wanted to \"fool around\" after their first date, which included a movie and dinner. She said no, not that night, and suggested the second date. Alex felt rejected, zoned out during the rest of the date, and later ghosted her, responding only minimally to her texts. His reasoning is that he lost interest because she didn't give him what he wanted, and he didn't want to spend more money on another date where the same might happen.\n\nNow, considering social norms and expectations, there's a lot here. The key points are consent, respect, and communication. Alex was honest about his intentions upfront, which is good, but then Casey was clear in her boundaries. The issue is his reaction. Ghosting is generally considered rude because it leaves the other person confused and unacknowledged. Even if he lost interest, cutting off communication without explanation can be hurtful. \n\nAlso, there's the aspect of respecting her wishes. If she wanted to take things slower, Alex's immediate decision to ghost might show a lack of respect for her boundaries. Plus, using financial reasons (money spent) to justify his actions could be seen as immature or transactional. \n\nHowever, some might argue that he's allowed to pursue what he wants and move on if it's not reciprocated. But the way he handled it\u2014ignoring her texts and giving minimal responses\u2014doesn't align with healthy communication. \n\nIn terms of ethics, while his feelings are valid, the method of disengagement matters. The author is in the wrong because he didn't communicate his feelings respectfully and chose to ghost instead of explaining his disinterest. So the answer would be A (Yes, he's in the wrong).\n"
