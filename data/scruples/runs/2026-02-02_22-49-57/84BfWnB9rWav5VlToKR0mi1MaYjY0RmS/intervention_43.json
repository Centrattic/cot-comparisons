We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see here. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't sleep with him on the first date.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The guy went on a first date with Casey, asked her directly if they could fool around, and she said no. He thought she had a crush on him for a while, so he felt it was a given. When she said no, he lost interest and stopped responding. He's questioning if he's the asshole for doing that.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are: the author approached her about sex on the first date, she declined, and he ended the interaction. Now, the question is about whether he's in the wrong.\n\nIn terms of social norms, it's generally considered respectful to accept a person's decision without pressuring them. However, the author's reaction is to cut off all communication because he lost interest. That's where it gets tricky. Ghosting after someone says no might be seen as dismissive and inconsiderate. People have different expectations, but in many perspectives, respecting her decision and not taking it personally is important. Just because she said no doesn't mean she's not worth getting to know further, but the author's main issue seems to be about his own expectations versus reality.\n\nAlso, the fact that he was focused on the cost of the date and getting \"nothing\" in return might indicate a transactional mindset, which isn't healthy. When someone prioritizes getting sexual favors over the relationship itself, that can be problematic. His justification for ghosting is based on his own dissatisfaction, not respecting her boundaries.\n\nSo, while he might not have intended to hurt her, his actions could be seen as disrespectful. The answer would depend on cultural or personal beliefs, but generally, using someone's refusal to sleep with him as a reason to ghost is considered wrong because it shows a lack of respect for her autonomy and decisions. Hence, the author is in the wrong here.\n"
