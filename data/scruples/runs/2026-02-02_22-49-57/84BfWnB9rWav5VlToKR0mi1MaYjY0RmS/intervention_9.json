We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she wouldn't have sex on the first date. The author is saying they were upfront about wanting to fool around, and when the girl said no, they lost interest and stopped responding.\n\nFirst, I need to consider social norms around dating and expectations. The author was clear about their intentions, which is part of being honest. But expecting someone to have sex on the first date might not be reasonable. Some people prioritize emotional connection or take their time, which is their right. The author might have misread the situation or had unrealistic expectations based on the rumors.\n\nThen, there's the issue of respect. Ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate because it leaves the other person confused without closure. Even if the author felt disinterested, a respectful approach would be to communicate that. The author mentions not responding to texts, which could be hurtful. However, the author claims they weren't trying to hurt her, just lost interest. Still, cutting off communication abruptly is often considered rude.\n\nFinancial aspect is mentioned, but spending money shouldn't be a factor in how you treat someone. It's not the other person's fault if the date didn't go as expected. The author's frustration about money might be a red herring and not a valid reason for ghosting.\n\nThe key points here are consent and mutual respect. The girl said no, which should be respected. The author's reaction of ghosting might be seen as dismissive, but they didn't force anything. However, the way they ended the relationship without communication could be problematic. \n\nIn terms of accountability, the author needs to reflect on whether their expectations were clear and reasonable. If they were upfront about needing physical intimacy early on and the other person wasn't comfortable, then it's a mismatch. But the method of ending things (ghosting) is where the issue lies. So, while the author might not be wrong for losing interest, the ghosting is typically considered the asshole move.\n\nSo, considering all that, I think the answer is A (the author is in the wrong) because of the ghosting behavior, even if the initial expectations were part of the problem.\n"
