We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that he went on a first date with Casey, asked her to fool around, she said no, and then he ghosted her. He's wondering if he's the asshole.\n\nFirst, I need to consider his actions. He asked her bluntly if they could go back to his place to \"fool around\" during the first date. She declined, saying she wasn't \"that\" and wanted to take it slow. He then lost interest and stopped responding, which is ghosting. \n\nThe key points here are his expectations and his response. He thought she had a crush on him for months, so he assumed she'd be interested in a physical relationship immediately. But she wanted to build a connection first. When she said no, he zoned out, thought about the money spent, and lost interest. That seems pretty selfish. \n\nGhosting is generally considered rude because it cuts off communication without explanation. Even if he's not interested anymore, disappearing without a clear reason can be hurtful. She's reached out to him, but he's only responding with minimal replies, which isn't fair to her. \n\nAlso, his attitude about the money spent on the date is problematic. Using the cost as a reason to cut her off is more about his own feelings of loss than respecting her boundaries. \n\nOn the other hand, he's honest about his intentions and his loss of interest. But the way he handled it is inconsiderate. People have different paces for relationships, and it's important to respect that. His decision to ghost her because she didn't meet his expectations is where the issue lies.\n\nSo, putting it all together, he's acting selfishly and not respecting her needs. Ghosting is not a good way to handle losing interest, especially when she's made it clear she wants to take things slower. Therefore, he's in the wrong.\n"
