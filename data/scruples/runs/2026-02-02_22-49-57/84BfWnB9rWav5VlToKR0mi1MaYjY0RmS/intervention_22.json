We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she wouldn't sleep with him on the first date. The author's reasoning is that he lost interest because she said no, and he's not interested in continuing the relationship unless there's physical intimacy. \n\nFirst, I need to consider if his actions are justified. Ghosting generally refers to cutting off communication abruptly without explanation, which can be hurtful. The author mentions not responding to her texts after the date, only giving minimal replies like a thumbs up or \"k\". So he isn't exactly ghosting in the traditional sense since he's responding a little, but he's clearly disengaging.\n\nThe key points here are consent and communication. The author approached her and asked if they could fool around, and she said no. Respecting her decision is important. However, he then decided to stop engaging with her, which could be seen as a reaction to her refusal. \n\nIn relationships, especially when someone is clear about their boundaries, it's important to respect those boundaries. If the author's main interest was in a physical relationship and she wasn't interested in that at the time, then it's her right to say no. The author might be in the wrong if he's using her refusal as a reason to devalue her or end the interaction without considering her feelings. \n\nOn the other hand, people have different preferences. If the author is looking for a relationship that includes physical intimacy and she's not ready for that, maybe it's not a good fit. But the way he's handling it\u2014ghosting\u2014could be hurtful. The question is whether his actions are respectful. \n\nI think the author is in the wrong because he's choosing to disengage abruptly and without explanation, which can be seen as dismissive. Even if he's not interested in continuing the relationship, there's a respectful way to communicate that. Ghosting, even a little, can be hurtful and shows a lack of consideration for her feelings. So the answer would be A, he is in the wrong.\n"
