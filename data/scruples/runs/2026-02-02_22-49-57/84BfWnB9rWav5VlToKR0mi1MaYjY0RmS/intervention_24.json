We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author of this situation is wrong for ghosting after the girl didn't sleep with him on the first date. The author set up the context where they had been flirting for a while, went on a date, and he asked her to go back to his place, which she declined. He then lost interest and stopped responding, hence ghosting her. The user thinks the author isn't in the wrong, but wants to know my take.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the norms around dating behavior. Ghosting is generally seen as rude because it leaves the other person in limbo without closure. However, the author's perspective is that he lost interest after she said no, and he's cutting his losses financially and emotionally. But is it acceptable to ghost someone for not meeting his sexual expectations?\n\nThe key points here are: the author made his intentions clear by asking her to go back to his place, she declined, and he then decided to ghost her. The question is whether his reaction is justified. On one hand, people have different boundaries and expectations. If the author's main interest was physical and she wasn't interested, then he might feel disinterested. But is it okay to cut off communication entirely without explanation? That's where ghosting becomes problematic. It's considered hurtful and disrespectful because it doesn't give the other person a chance to understand or respond.\n\nAnother angle is that the author might be projecting his expectations. He thought she had a crush on him, but maybe she had different expectations for the relationship. By ghosting, he's not being honest about his feelings, which could be seen as inconsiderate. Even if he's not interested anymore, a respectful approach would be to explain that he's not interested in pursuing a relationship, rather than disappearing.\n\nAlso, the financial aspect he mentions\u2014feeling he wasted money\u2014shouldn't be a reason to ghost. Relationships shouldn't be transactional in that sense. The decision to continue a relationship should be based on mutual interest and respect, not on cost-benefit analysis.\n\nIn terms of societal views, some might argue that if someone's primary goal is to have a sexual encounter and it doesn't happen, it's okay to disengage. But that's a narrow view and can be seen as objectifying the other person. Healthy relationships require mutual respect, communication, and consideration for each other's boundaries.\n\nSo, while the author's feelings of disinterest are valid, the way he handled it by ghosting is where the issue lies. He could have been upfront about his feelings instead of cutting her off. Therefore, the answer would be that he is in the wrong for ghosting her without providing closure.\n"
