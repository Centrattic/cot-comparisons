We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to work through this. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA (Am I the Asshole) post is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't have sex on the first date. \n\nFirst, I need to understand both sides. The author went on a date with Casey, asked her directly if they could fool around after the first date, she said no, and he then lost interest and stopped communicating.\n\nHmm, so the main issue here is whether it's wrong to ghost someone because they didn't have sex on the first date. Let's think about consent and respect. The author approached Casey directly and asked, and she declined. That's her right. The author, however, felt that since she had a crush for months, he expected a yes. But that's not how it works. People can say no even if they have feelings. \n\nGhosting is generally considered rude because it cuts off communication without explanation. It can hurt the other person. The author mentioned Casey tried to reach out after, but he didn't respond. That's not being respectful of her efforts to communicate.\n\nBut the author's reasoning is that he lost interest. Is it wrong to lose interest? Well, losing interest is natural, but the way he handled it by ghosting is the issue. Maybe he should have been honest about his feelings instead of disappearing. \n\nAlso, the author's attitude about the money spent on the date might play into his decision, which could be a red flag. Prioritizing financial loss over her consent is not healthy. \n\nSo, while the author might not have malicious intent, his actions of ghosting are inconsiderate. He could have communicated that he wasn't interested instead of cutting her off abruptly. Therefore, I think he is in the wrong.\n"
