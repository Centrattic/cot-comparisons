We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The person is asking if they're the asshole for ghosting someone after she didn't have sex on the first date. He's been honest from the start, asking her outright if she wanted to fool around. She said no and wanted to take things slower. He then lost interest and hasn't responded to her texts beyond minimal replies.\n\nFirst, communication. He was upfront about his intentions, which is good. But she had made it clear she wanted to take things slow. Ghosting is generally considered inconsiderate, even if the person is uninterested. He's not responding to her texts, which might be hurting her feelings. However, he's not lying; he's just disinterested after the rejection. \n\nValues and expectations play a role here. If he's looking for a casual relationship and she wants to take it slow, there's a mismatch. But ghosting is a poor way to handle it. A better approach would be to have an honest conversation, even if it's awkward. \n\nMoney is mentioned as a factor, which seems a bit materialistic. But it's his choice how he wants to spend his time and money. That said, the main issue is the ghosting. The question is whether he's in the wrong for cutting off communication without explanation. \n\nIn many perspectives, ghosting is seen as inconsiderate regardless of the reason. Even if he's not interested anymore, not responding to her attempts to reach out is rude. He could have been honest about his feelings without being cruel. \n\nSo, while his actions come from a place of disinterest, the method of ending contact is problematic. The answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because of the ghosting, but some might argue B (not in the wrong) because he was honest upfront. But the ghosting part is more about respect towards her, so A makes sense.\n"
