We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the person who wrote the scenario is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't have sex on the first date.\n\nFirst, the writer acknowledges that Casey had a crush for months. They went on a first date where he asked her directly if they could go back to his place. She said no, wanting to take things slower. He then lost interest and stopped responding. He cites spending money and feeling it was a \"done deal\" because of her previous interest. \n\nGhosting is generally considered rude because it leaves the other person without closure. Even if the writer is honest about losing interest, cutting off communication entirely without explaining is seen as inconsiderate. The fact that Casey reached out again shows she was trying to salvage the connection, but he didn't respond. \n\nThe writer's reasoning is flawed because he assumed physical intimacy was guaranteed, which isn't fair. Relationships should be based on mutual consent and respect, not on expectations of a certain outcome. The money spent shouldn't affect how he treats her. Ghosting doesn't address the situation respectfully.\n\nWhile the writer might not have malicious intent, his actions are still hurtful and dismissive. So, he's in the wrong.\n"
