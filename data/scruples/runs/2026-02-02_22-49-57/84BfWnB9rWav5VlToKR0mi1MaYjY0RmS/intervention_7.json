We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't have sex on the first date. The question is presented through an AITA post, so we need to analyze the situation carefully.\n\nFirst, the author went on a date with Casey. He was direct about wanting to have sex after the first date, but she said no and suggested waiting. He then lost interest and stopped communicating, only responding minimally. The user says they think the author isn't wrong, but they want my opinion.\n\nI need to consider both sides. On one hand, the author was honest about his intentions, which is good. People have different expectations, and if someone is clear from the start, that's fair. But the other person might feel hurt or disrespected because the author completely cut off communication because she didn't meet his expectations. Ghosting is generally seen as inconsiderate because it leaves the other person hanging without explanation.\n\nAlso, the author mentions feeling like the money was wasted, which shows he was focused on getting something in return, which isn't healthy. Healthy relationships shouldn't be transactional. The fact that he lost all interest after one rejection might indicate that his interest wasn't genuine to begin with. He might have been more interested in a sexual encounter than building a relationship.\n\nBut on the flip side, if he was honest about his desires and she didn't meet them, it's his choice to move on. People should be able to make their own decisions about how to pursue relationships. However, the way he ended things was abrupt and without communication, which is where the issue lies. Ghosting is usually frowned upon because it's disrespectful to the other person's feelings.\n\nSo, while the author isn't necessarily wrong for losing interest, the act of ghosting is problematic. The key is whether the author's actions were respectful. Ghosting is often considered inconsiderate regardless of the reason. So maybe the answer is that he is in the wrong for ghosting, even if his initial request was honest.\n"
