We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she didn't have sex on the first date. The situation is that they had been flirting for a while, went on a date, and the guy asked her to go back to his place. She said no and wanted to take things slower. He then lost interest and stopped responding.\n\nHmm. Well, I need to consider the social norms here. Ghosting generally refers to cutting off communication abruptly without explanation. The guy here is just not replying to her texts and giving minimal responses. Is that considered wrong?\n\nThe guy's reasoning is that he lost all interest because she didn't give him what he wanted. But is it okay to ghost someone for that reason? People have different expectations, but the key here is communication. He didn't explain why he wasn't interested anymore. Ghosting is often seen as inconsiderate because the other person is left without closure.\n\nAlso, the fact that he was focused on getting physical on the first date might indicate his intentions were more about sex rather than building a relationship. If he was honest from the start, that's one thing, but if he led her on with expectations of taking things slow and then became upset when she didn't comply, that's a problem.\n\nShe had asked him if he wanted to go back to his place, and he made his desire clear. She said no, and he didn't respond properly. Then he just stopped communicating. Even if he's not in the wrong for losing interest, the way he handled it\u2014ghosting\u2014could make him the asshole. People deserve an explanation, especially if someone is trying to reach out.\n\nAnother angle: he mentions spending money on the date, which he sees as a loss. That's not a valid reason to ghost someone. Expecting immediate physical intimacy can be a personal choice, but using that as a justification for cutting someone off without communication is not acceptable. The financial aspect shouldn't influence how you treat someone's feelings.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions of ghosting without explanation and treating her decision to take things slow as a negative might make him the asshole. He didn't respect her boundaries and didn't communicate his feelings properly. Therefore, the answer is A (author is in the wrong).\n"
