We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she didn't sleep with him on the first date. The author's reasoning is that he lost interest because she didn't go back to his place as he expected. He's been honest about his intentions, and when she said no, he just stopped engaging with her.\n\nHmm, so first, I need to consider what's appropriate in such situations. Ghosting is generally considered rude because it cuts off communication without explanation. But in this case, the author claims he's not trying to hurt her, just that he lost interest. However, Casey is reaching out, and he's not responding meaningfully. \n\nHe mentions that he asked bluntly if she wanted to take things further, and when she said no, he assumed she had a crush and it was an easy yes. That part seems a bit presumptuous. Maybe he put pressure on her, and when she said no, he took it personally. It's important to respect someone's boundaries even if you're disappointed. \n\nAlso, the fact that he thought he had a \"done deal\" because of rumors about her having feelings might not be a good reason to push for physical intimacy. If she's clear that she wants to take things slower, it's the person's responsibility to respect that. Ghosting her afterward for not meeting his expectations might not be fair. \n\nHe's also mentioning the money spent on the date as a factor. That adds a bit of transactional thinking, which can be problematic. If he's only interested in her if there's immediate physical intimacy, maybe it's not a genuine connection. But his behavior after the date\u2014zoning out, not engaging, then ghosting\u2014could be seen as dismissive and hurtful, regardless of his personal feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, people have different speeds for intimacy. If he's honest about his desires and she's not interested, it's her right to say no. But the question is about whether he's in the wrong for cutting off communication. Even if he's disappointed, ghosting is generally considered inconsiderate. However, some might argue that it's his right to disengage if his interests aren't met. \n\nI need to weigh these factors. The key points are the blunt approach, his assumption that she would say yes, the transactional aspect of the money, and the ghosting. Ghosting is usually seen as rude, but if he's clear about his needs and she can't meet them, maybe it's not entirely his fault. However, the act of ghosting without a clear explanation, especially after she's reached out, does make him look bad. \n\nSo, the answer might be A (he's in the wrong) because he didn't handle it respectfully. Even if he lost interest, he should have at least communicated that rather than ghosting. Alternatively, if he's honest about his expectations upfront and she doesn't meet them, maybe it's not his fault. But the way he handled the aftermath, avoiding communication and ignoring her messages, is problematic. Also, the fact that he's focused on the money and seeing her as an \"easy sell\" could indicate his approach was flawed from the start. \n\nTherefore, the author's actions\u2014ghosting and not responding to her messages\u2014make him the asshole because he didn't respect her decision and cut off communication in a hurtful way.\n"
