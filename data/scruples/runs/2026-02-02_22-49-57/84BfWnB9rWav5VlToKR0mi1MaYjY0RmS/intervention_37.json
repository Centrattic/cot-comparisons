We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's tackle this question. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she refused to have sex on the first date.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the situation. The author and Casey had been flirting for two months, and rumors suggested she had a crush on him. After their first date, he asked her to go back to his place, which she declined, saying she wasn't like that and wanted to take things slower. The author then lost interest, stopped responding, and ghosted her. He justifies this by saying he spent money on the date and doesn't want to invest more if there's no sexual reward.\n\nNow, considering social norms and relationship etiquette. Ghosting is generally frowned upon because it's abrupt and leaves the other person confused without closure. But the user argues that the author isn't in the wrong because he lost interest. The question is whether his actions are justified.\n\nThe author's perspective is that he was honest about his intentions from the start. He asked directly if they could fool around, and she said no. He then felt that the connection was gone, especially since he had expectations. But the problem here might be that he was too focused on his own desires and didn't respect her boundaries or her need for a slower pace. \n\nIn dating, mutual respect is key. If the author was clear he only wanted a sexual relationship and she was looking for something more, there was a mismatch. However, the author's approach of ghosting without communication is considered rude, regardless of the reason. Even if he felt disinterested, a polite communication would be better than cutting off all contact.\n\nAlso, the author's reasoning about the money spent on the date is a bit selfish. Emotional investment and respect should not be transactional. Expecting a sexual encounter after one date can also be seen as pressuring someone, which isn't healthy. So, maybe the author's problem is not just in ghosting but in initially expecting physical intimacy so soon.\n\nBut the user says the author isn't in the wrong. The user's reasoning might be that the author was honest and the decision was based on his own comfort. However, ghosting is still an issue. The question is whether the action (ghosting) is wrong, not just the decision to lose interest.\n\nIn conclusion, even if the author felt justified in losing interest, the act of ghosting is considered inconsiderate. So the answer might be A (the author is in the wrong) because he didn't communicate his disinterest respectfully and left Casey hanging. However, the initial expectation of sex on the first date might also be a point of critique. But according to the question, it's about whether he's in the wrong for ghosting. Typically, ghosting is seen as rude, so the answer would be A.\n"
