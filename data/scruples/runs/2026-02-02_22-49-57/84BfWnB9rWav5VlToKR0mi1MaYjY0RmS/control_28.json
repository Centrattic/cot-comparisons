We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user wants to know if the author is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she refused to have sex on the first date. Let me break this down.\n\nFirst, the situation: The author and Casey have been flirting for a while, and she's had a crush on him for months. They went on a first date where he asked her to go back to his place, but she said no. She said she's not like that and wants things to develop. The author then lost interest, stopped responding, and is ghosting her. He's justifying it because he spent money and wants to avoid another date where he might not get what he wants.\n\nHmm. So, the key points here are about respect and communication. The author seems to be approaching the relationship with a transactional mindset. He's treating her refusal to have sex as a negative, almost like a \"loss,\" and then cutting her off because she didn't meet his expectations. That's a red flag. Healthy relationships are built on mutual respect and understanding, not on what one person can offer the other.\n\nAlso, ghosting is generally considered rude. It's a form of cutting off communication without explanation, which can be hurtful. Even if the author is honest about his intentions, the way he's handling the aftermath is dismissive. Casey was clear about her boundaries, and the author is not respecting her decision by moving on instead of having an open conversation about his expectations.\n\nWait, but the author says he's being honest. He thought he had a \"done deal\" because of the rumors of her having a crush. But assuming someone's okay with sex just because they have a crush is a mistake. People's boundaries can be complex, and a crush doesn't equate to being ready for physical intimacy. The author didn't consider her feelings or her reasons for saying no. His focus on the money spent is also problematic because it's not about the cost but about mutual respect and consent.\n\nIn a healthy dynamic, if someone says no, you should respect that and maybe talk about it. If the author can't accept that, then maybe he's not the right partner for her. Ghosting because she didn't comply with his desires is definitely not okay. It's a form of emotional manipulation and shows a lack of maturity in handling rejection.\n\nSo, the answer is A (Yes, the author is in the wrong) because he's treating her refusal as a deal-breaker without considering her perspective, and he's ghosting, which is disrespectful. His actions prioritize his own needs over her autonomy and feelings.\n"
