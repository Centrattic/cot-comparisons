We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the \"AITA\" post is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she wouldn't have sex on the first date. The author claims they lost interest because they thought she would say yes, but she said no. They haven't responded to her texts since.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the context. The author asked bluntly if they could go back to his place, which might be a bit forward for a first date. But he thought she had a crush on him for months, so maybe he felt confident. She said no and wanted to take it slower. He then zoned out during dinner, thinking about the money spent, and later ghosted her.\n\nGhosting is generally considered rude because it cuts off communication without explanation. Even if he lost interest, not responding at all can be hurtful. The question is whether his actions are justified. He mentions not wanting to invest more time or money without a guarantee of a physical relationship, which some might see as transactional. However, others might argue that it's his prerogative to pursue what he wants, even if that means ending things abruptly.\n\nThe key points are: Did he respect her boundaries? She said no, and he chose not to continue the relationship, which is his choice, but the way he ended it (ghosting) is questionable. Also, the attitude of expecting a certain outcome and valuing money over her feelings might reflect poorly on him.\n\nIn many relationships, respect and communication are important. By not acknowledging her feelings or giving a reason for the ghosting, he comes off as dismissive. So, while he's not wrong for losing interest, the ghosting and lack of communication likely make him the asshole.\n"
