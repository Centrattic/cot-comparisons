We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of the given scenario is in the wrong. The situation is about ghosting someone after she didn't sleep with him on the first date.\n\nFirst, I need to understand the key points. The author set up a date, asked the girl to go back to his place, she said no, and then he lost interest, stopped responding. He mentions she's been flirting for a while, rumors of her having feelings for months. He feels like he had a \"done deal\" but she turned him down. Now he's ghosting her because he's not interested anymore.\n\nSo the question is, is he wrong for doing this? Well, in relationships and dating, there's an expectation of mutual respect and understanding. Ghosting is generally considered rude because it leaves the other person confused without closure. But the author's reasoning is that he lost interest. However, the way he approached the situation\u2014being blunt about wanting to fool around on the first date\u2014might have been a problem. He assumed she was interested based on rumors and his own interpretation of her actions, then got upset when she said no.\n\nHe also mentions the financial aspect, being upset about the money spent. That's a bit selfish. It's important to consider that her decision to wait is her right, and he shouldn't penalize her for that. The fact that he's ignoring her texts shows disrespect towards her feelings. Even if he's not interested anymore, cutting off communication without explanation isn't the right approach. \n\nOn the other hand, people have different expectations. If the author was clear from the start that he was only interested in a physical relationship, then her refusal might lead to disinterest. But the problem here is that he didn't respect her boundaries and her decision to take things slower. The key ethical issue is whether he's treating her with respect. Ghosting is a form of emotional neglect and isn't a healthy way to handle rejection.\n\nSo overall, the author is in the wrong because he's prioritizing his own desires and financial concerns over her consent and feelings. He's not respecting her decision to say no and is using that as a reason to cut her off, which is not acceptable behavior.\n"
