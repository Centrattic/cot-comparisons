We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let me try to work through this. The user is asking whether the author of the AITA post is in the wrong for ghosting someone after she wouldn't have sex on the first date. \n\nFirst, I need to recall the details. The guy went on a first date with Casey, asked her directly if they could go back to his place to \"fool around,\" she said no and said they should wait until the second date. He then lost interest, stopped responding, and hasn't communicated much since, only minimal replies when she texts. He justifies it by saying he spent money and the money wasted, and he lost all interest.\n\nNow, considering social norms and relationship ethics. The main issue here is whether it's acceptable to cut someone off because they refused a request for sex on the first date. Ghosting is generally considered rude or inconsiderate, regardless of the reason. But the man argues that he's being honest and that he lost interest after being rejected.\n\nHowever, even if he lost interest, cutting off communication abruptly without explaining is typically seen as inconsiderate. It's important to consider both sides. She might feel hurt and confused by being ghosted, especially if she had expressed interest in continuing the relationship. The man's approach of being upfront is honest, but his reaction to her refusal is where the problem lies. \n\nIn many perspectives, respect in relationships means respecting the other person's boundaries. If he wasn't okay with taking things slower, maybe he shouldn't have pursued a relationship. Also, the financial aspect isn't a valid reason to ghost someone. People date for emotional connection, not cost-benefit analysis. \n\nThe fact that he didn't respond to her messages shows a lack of consideration for her feelings. Even if he was disinterested, a polite explanation would be better than ghosting. So, while his feelings are valid, his actions are inconsiderate. Therefore, the answer would be A (the author is in the wrong).\n"
