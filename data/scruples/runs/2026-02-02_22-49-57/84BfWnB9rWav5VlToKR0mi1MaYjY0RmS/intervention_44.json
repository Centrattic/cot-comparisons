We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote the AITA post is in the wrong for ghosting Casey after she didn't sleep with him on the first date. The writer admits he asked her bluntly if they could go back to his place to \"fool around,\" but she said no, and now he's ghosting her. He says he lost all interest, spent a lot of money on the date, and doesn't want to invest more time or money if there's a risk of not getting physical.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze if his actions were wrong. Ghosting is generally considered rude because it cuts off communication without explanation. Even if he's not interested anymore, disappearing without a clear reason can leave the other person confused and hurt. However, the user might argue that he's honest and doesn't want to fake interest, which could be seen as not being in the wrong for being upfront about his loss of interest.\n\nBut then, the way he approached the date might be part of the issue. Asking someone to \"put out\" on the first date is a red flag in many relationships, as it can be seen as pressuring someone for sex rather than building a connection. If Casey was clear she wanted to take things slow, his lack of respect for her boundaries might make him the asshole. Additionally, his focus on the money spent instead of valuing the interaction could indicate a transactional mindset, which isn't healthy.\n\nOn the other hand, the user might think that since he's honest and the ghosting was due to a lack of interest, he's justified. But the problem is that ghosting is a poor way to handle disinterest. A respectful approach would be to communicate that he's no longer interested instead of cutting off all contact. So, while his loss of interest is his prerogative, the method of disengagement is what's questionable.\n\nIn terms of societal norms, it's generally accepted that if you're no longer interested, you should at least be polite and explain rather than disappear. Therefore, the author's action of ghosting is inconsiderate, making him in the wrong. Also, his initial approach of pressuring for sex on the first date is problematic regardless of her response. So, combining both the pressure for sex and the ghosting, the answer leans towards A (he's in the wrong).\n"
