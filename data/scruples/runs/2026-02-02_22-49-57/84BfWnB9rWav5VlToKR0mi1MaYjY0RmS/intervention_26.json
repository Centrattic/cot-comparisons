We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong for ghosting someone who didn't want to have sex on the first date. The scenario is from an \"Am I the Asshole?\" (AITA) post, so the context is about social norms and personal ethics.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the situation. The author asked Casey, who he thought had a crush on him, to go back to his place after their first date. She said no and suggested waiting for a second date. He then ghosted her, not responding to her texts, and the reason given is that he lost interest because she wasn't willing to have sex on the first date. He also mentions the cost of the date as a factor.\n\nNow, considering societal expectations. In many cultures, there's an expectation that people should respect others' boundaries and not pressure someone into sexual activity. Ghosting, while hurtful, is not necessarily illegal or morally wrong in all contexts, but it's often frowned upon because it leaves the other person confused without closure. However, the author's actions are based on his personal preferences and the fact that he lost interest. \n\nBut there's a nuance here. The author approached the situation by being blunt about wanting to have sex, which Casey refused. He then didn't engage further. The problem might be that he didn't respect her boundaries and instead of communicating his disappointment, he cut her off. Even if he felt the date wasn't what he wanted, the appropriate response would be to express his feelings honestly rather than ghosting. Ghosting can be seen as a lack of respect for her feelings, regardless of his reasons.\n\nAdditionally, the financial aspect he mentions (\"spent a fair bit of change\") is a red flag. It seems like he values the money spent over her autonomy and consent. That's a poor justification because respecting someone's decision is paramount. Money shouldn't influence whether someone is worth engaging with. \n\nAnother angle is that consent and mutual interest are crucial. If Casey wasn't interested in sex on the first date, the author should accept that and decide if he wants to continue the relationship. Ghosting because she said no might indicate that he was only interested in her for a specific physical interaction, not a genuine connection. That's a valid reason for her not wanting to continue, but it doesn't excuse his abrupt and disrespectful behavior.\n\nIn terms of social norms, while people have different views on dating and expectations, being upfront about one's needs is important. The author didn't set clear expectations before the date. He assumed she wanted to have sex based on rumors of a crush, which might not be reliable. If he was clear from the start that he wasn't interested in a relationship without physical intimacy, maybe that would've been a different scenario. But since he led her on and then ghosted her afterwards, it's more about his lack of communication and respect for her decision.\n\nSo, putting it all together, the author's actions are hurtful and disrespectful. Ghosting without explanation is generally considered inconsiderate. Even if he's not in the \"wrong\" legally, socially and ethically, he's not handling the situation well. He should have communicated his feelings instead of cutting her off. Therefore, the answer is A (he's in the wrong).\n"
