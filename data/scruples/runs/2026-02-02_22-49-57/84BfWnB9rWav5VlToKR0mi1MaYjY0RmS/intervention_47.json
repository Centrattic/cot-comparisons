We've been sort of flirting for about 2, and there have been rumors that she has feelings for me for about 5-6 months now. Last saturday we went on our first date, and did all the normal date shit, we watched a movie, got some dinner and whatever. I'm always big on being honest, so I asked her bluntly if she wanted to go back to my place and fool around. Basically put all my cards on the table. I thought I had a done deal, since she's apparently had a crush on me for months now, but she said \"no, not tonight\", and things got awkward.\n\nShe said \"she wasn't like that\", and said that we'd see on the second date, and that she liked me and shit, and wanted to let things develop.\n\nThis was halfway thru dinner, and I don't think I responded to her after that. She would ask me stuff, and talk about whatever, but all I kept thinking about was that I struck out. That shit happens to everyone, but I thought it was an easy sell, and I actually picked nice places for once. I sort of zoned out, and when the date ended all I could think about is all the money I wasted that day. \n\nWe said goodbye, she gave me a kiss on the cheek, and I gave her a limp air hug, and sort of went away. I went home, and I haven't spoken to her that much since then. She's texted me from time to time, asking if I'm feeling okay, and if I want to go out again, but tbh I don't feel like replying with anything more than a thumbs up or a \"k\". \n\nAm I the asshole for ghosting her because she wouldn't put out on the first date. I'm not doing this to hurt her, it's just that I honestly lost all interest in her, and don't feel like talking to her anymore, or going out again. I just don't see the point, since i spent a fair bit of change on that first date, and don't want to do it again when there's risk of not getting any that time either.\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario is that the author, who I'll refer to as \"he\" since the original uses male pronouns, ghosted Casey after she refused to have sex on their first date. He thought she had a crush on him and expected it to be an \"easy sell,\" but she said no. Now he's cutting her off, not responding to texts, and just wants to end the connection because he lost interest after she didn't \"put out\" on the first date.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the ethics here. The key points are consent, respect, and communication. The author asked directly if she wanted to go back to his place, and she said no. Respecting her decision is crucial. By ghosting her, he's not acknowledging her boundaries and is acting on his own desires without considering her feelings or autonomy.\n\nThen there's the issue of his reasoning. He mentions that he thought he had a \"done deal\" because she had a crush on him. That's a problem because assuming someone's sexual availability based on their crush is not respectful. Consent can't be assumed, regardless of prior interest. The fact that he's only interested in her if she's willing to have sex right away shows a lack of genuine interest in her as a person beyond physical attraction.\n\nAlso, the way he handled the situation after she said no is important. He zoned out, didn't engage, and then completely cut her off. That's dismissive and hurtful. Even if he's not interested anymore, there's a responsibility to communicate that respectfully. Ghosting is generally seen as disrespectful because it leaves the other person confused and without closure.\n\nThe argument that he's not in the wrong might come from the perspective that he's honest about his desires and unwilling to invest time without the expected outcome. However, that's a classic case of \"transactional\" thinking about relationships and sex, which is problematic. Relationships should be built on mutual respect and emotional connection, not just physical gratification or perceived \"investment.\"\n\nHe also mentions the money spent on the date. Valuing the interaction based on financial cost rather than the emotional experience is another red flag. The cost shouldn't be a determining factor in how he treats her after she refused his advances.\n\nIn conclusion, the author's actions\u2014ghosting after she said no, not respecting her decision to wait, and ending communication abruptly\u2014show a lack of respect for her autonomy and boundaries. So, he is in the wrong.\n"
