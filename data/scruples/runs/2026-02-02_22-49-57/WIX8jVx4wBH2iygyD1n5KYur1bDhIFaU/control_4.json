One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is about a guy who had a sleepover with his female friend, and his girlfriend got upset about it. The user wants to know if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, the key points from the story: The author's friend Annie (who is in a relationship) came over to his room, they had drinks, watched TV, smoked, and fell asleep together. The girlfriend found out the next day and was upset. She mentioned past instances where Annie crossed boundaries, like holding his hand. Also, there's a prior conversation where they joked about threesomes and the author mentioned Annie. Now the girlfriend is upset, and the author feels his friend's behavior might affect their friendship.\n\nSo, the question is whether the author did something wrong. Let's break it down. The main issue here is the girlfriend's discomfort with the sleepover and Annie's behavior. The author didn't intentionally do anything to harm their relationship. He didn't initiate the sleepover, and they fell asleep after a party. However, the girlfriend feels it's inappropriate, especially given their previous jokes about threesomes. \n\nThe author argues that he didn't mean anything by it and loves his girlfriend. But the girlfriend's reaction is about feeling neglected or insecure, which is a valid emotional response. The problem here is about boundaries in relationships. Even if the author didn't have bad intentions, not considering his girlfriend's feelings by allowing another girl to sleep in his bed could be seen as a breach of trust, even if it's a friend.\n\nAlso, the prior conversation about threesomes and mentioning Annie could have planted seeds of doubt in the girlfriend's mind. She might have felt that he was more open to the idea with Annie, making the sleepover more problematic. Even if it was just a joke, the girlfriend might have taken it seriously, leading to her current feelings.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't do anything explicitly wrong. He didn't have an affair or intentionally disrespect his girlfriend. The issue is more about communication and considering her feelings. He might not be in the wrong, but he could have been more mindful of her perspective. The friend Annie's actions (holding hands, etc.) also contribute to the girlfriend's discomfort, but the author's responsibility is to respect his girlfriend's boundaries.\n\nIn relationships, what's important is mutual respect and communication. If the girlfriend feels that certain actions are making her uncomfortable, the partner should be aware and adjust their behavior. The author might not have intended harm, but not acknowledging her feelings could be seen as a lack of consideration. So, while he might not be entirely at fault, there's room for him to improve in being more attentive to her needs.\n\nThe answer depends on whether the act of sleeping in the same bed with a friend is considered inappropriate in their relationship. If they had an open discussion about boundaries beforehand and this was agreed upon, then maybe it's not his fault. But if it's a breach of unspoken boundaries, he might share some responsibility. The key is that the girlfriend's feelings are valid, even if the author didn't mean to hurt her. So, the author isn't necessarily in the wrong, but he could have been more considerate.\n"
