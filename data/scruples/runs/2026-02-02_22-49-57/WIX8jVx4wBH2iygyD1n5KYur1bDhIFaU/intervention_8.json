One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong in this situation. The scenario is about a guy who had a sleepover with his female friend, and his girlfriend got upset about it. The guy says he didn't do anything on purpose, and his girlfriend brought up past incidents like the friend touching his hair and holding his hand. Also, there was a conversation about threesomes where he mentioned this friend. The girlfriend admitted he didn't initiate anything but was upset because of the past conversation.\n\nSo the main points here are communication and boundaries. The author didn't ask his girlfriend, but he thought it was just a sleepover. However, the girlfriend felt it was inappropriate, especially considering the previous talk about threesomes. The key issue is whether the author overstepped by having the friend in his bed without informing his girlfriend, even if unintentionally.\n\nIn relationships, trust and communication are crucial. Even if the author didn't mean to hurt her feelings, not considering her perspective might be a problem. The fact that there was a prior conversation about threesomes and the friend being part of that adds to the girlfriend's discomfort. The author might not be \"in the wrong\" in a malicious sense, but he could be seen as not respecting his girlfriend's boundaries, even if subconsciously. So, depending on how you view the situation, the answer could be B (No) because he didn't act with bad intentions, but there's also a case for A (Yes) because of the lack of communication and potential insensitivity to her feelings. However, since the girlfriend admitted he didn't initiate it, maybe the main issue is the communication breakdown, making the author not in the wrong but needing to improve communication. I think the answer here is B.\n"
