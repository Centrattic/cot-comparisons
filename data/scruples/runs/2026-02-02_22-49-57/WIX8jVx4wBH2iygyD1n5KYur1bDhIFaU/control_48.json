One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, so I need to figure out if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. Let's start by breaking down the situation they described.\n\nThe author is in a two-year relationship with their girlfriend. They had a friend, Annie, who is in a long-term relationship herself. One night, Annie came over to have drinks, then ended up staying in the author's room, watching TV, smoking, and falling asleep together. The author didn't mention this to their girlfriend at first, but when they did, the girlfriend was upset. She brought up other instances where Annie might have crossed boundaries, like playing with the author's hair and holding hands at a festival while the girlfriend was nearby. The author didn't realize these actions upset her. Also, there was a previous conversation where they jokingly discussed having threesomes and the author mentioned Annie, which the girlfriend now brings up as a reason for her feelings of betrayal.\n\nFirst, the main issue is the sleepover. Even though they just fell asleep together, the girlfriend felt it was inappropriate. The author didn't ask his girlfriend beforehand, which could be a red flag in a relationship. Trust and communication are key here. The girlfriend had valid concerns about boundaries, especially since they had discussed threesomes in a joking manner. Even if the author didn't have any intention, the action might have made the girlfriend feel insecure or disrespected.\n\nThen there are the other instances where Annie's behavior, like holding hands, might have been overstepping. The author didn't notice these made his girlfriend uncomfortable, which shows a lack of awareness about her feelings. The fact that they had joked about threesomes involving Annie probably made the girlfriend think the author was open to that, hence the hurt feelings when the sleepover happened.\n\nThe author is now worried about their friendship with Annie and feels the girlfriend overreacted. But from the girlfriend's perspective, the combination of past jokes about threesomes and the sleepover could make her feel like the author isn't respecting the relationship's boundaries. Even if the author didn't intend any wrongdoing, the actions might have unintentionally hurt her.\n\nSo, considering all this, the author might not be entirely in the wrong because they didn't have malicious intent. However, they did fail to communicate with their girlfriend about the sleepover and didn't consider her feelings in previous interactions with Annie. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because she felt her boundaries were crossed, even if the author didn't realize it. Therefore, the answer might be that the author is partially at fault, but the situation is complex. However, since the question is whether the author is in the wrong, and given the girlfriend's feelings are important in a relationship, the answer could be that the author is in the wrong for not considering her feelings and not setting clearer boundaries with Annie.\n"
