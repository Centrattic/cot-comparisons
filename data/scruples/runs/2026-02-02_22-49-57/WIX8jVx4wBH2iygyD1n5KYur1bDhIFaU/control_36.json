One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the author of this situation is in the wrong. The scenario involves a guy (21M) having a sleepover with his female friend (22F) Annie, and not informing his girlfriend (20F). The girlfriend got upset about it, even though the guy didn't do anything intentionally wrong. \n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The author and Annie were going to a party but ended up staying over, fell asleep in his room. The girlfriend was at a concert with a friend and didn't come over. He told her the next day, but didn't realize she was upset until later. The girlfriend brought up past instances where Annie crossed boundaries, like playing with his hair and holding hands at a festival. Also, there was a previous conversation where they joked about threesomes, and the author mentioned Annie.\n\nNow, the main question is whether the author is in the wrong. Let's consider the perspectives. The author didn't have any romantic intentions with Annie and was unaware that his actions made his girlfriend uncomfortable. However, the girlfriend's feelings are valid because she felt the sleepover was inappropriate, especially since they were in a committed relationship. \n\nIn relationships, communication is key. Even if the author didn't plan anything, the fact that Annie slept in his bed could be seen as a breach of trust. The girlfriend's reaction might be influenced by the previous joke about threesomes. If he mentioned Annie in that context, it's understandable that the girlfriend would feel uneasy when Annie is in his bed, even if it's not intentional. \n\nAlso, the boundaries between friends and partners are important. The author's close friendship with Annie might create situations that the girlfriend finds uncomfortable. Even if the actions are innocent, the girlfriend's perception and feelings matter. The author's lack of awareness of how his actions affected her is a problem. \n\nOn the other hand, the author is trying to maintain a friendship and didn't do anything wrong on purpose. The girlfriend might be overreacting, but her feelings are real. The key here is whether the author should have considered his girlfriend's perspective and communicated more proactively. \n\nThe author should have discussed the sleepover with his girlfriend beforehand, even if it was just friends. The previous joke about threesomes could have planted a seed of doubt. Also, not noticing Annie's past overstepping behaviors shows he might not be as attentive to his girlfriend's concerns. \n\nSo, while the author may not have intended to do anything wrong, the lack of communication and the previous comments could lead the girlfriend to feel neglected or insecure. Therefore, the author might share some responsibility for not being more considerate of her feelings.\n"
