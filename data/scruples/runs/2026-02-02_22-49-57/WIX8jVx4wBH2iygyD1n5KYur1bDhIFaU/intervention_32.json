One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So, the situation is that the author had a sleepover with their male friend Annie, a 22F who's in a long-term relationship, and didn't tell their girlfriend. The girlfriend got upset.\n\nFirst, let's look at the details. The author and Annie went to watch TV in his room, smoked some weed, and fell asleep. The girlfriend found out the next morning and was upset. She mentioned other instances where Annie crossed boundaries, like playing with his hair and holding hands at a festival. Also, there was a past conversation where they joked about threesomes and the author mentioned Annie, which might have added to the girlfriend's hurt feelings.\n\nSo, the main question here is whether the author did something wrong. The author didn't initiate anything, and they didn't have a romantic relationship with Annie. But the girlfriend felt it was inappropriate because they were in her boyfriend's room and fell asleep together. The author didn't realize this made the girlfriend upset, which is a point to consider. Communication is key in relationships, and maybe the author should have checked in with the girlfriend earlier about their boundaries. However, the girlfriend might have overreacted, especially if the author didn't mean anything by it. The past joke about threesomes could have caused her to take it more seriously than it was. Also, the author is now worrying about their friendship with Annie because of this, which shows they care about maintaining their friendship and might not have intended to harm the relationship. \n\nBut, from the girlfriend's perspective, even if the author didn't do anything with intent, she feels her partner was careless with her feelings. She brought up past issues, which suggests that there were previous red flags that the author didn't take seriously. The fact that Annie is in a relationship might also be a point; the author could have been more cautious about having someone else in their bed, even if it was just a sleepover. However, the author didn't have any romantic intentions, so maybe the girlfriend is overstepping. \n\nIn relationships, partners often have different boundaries. The key here is whether the author crossed those boundaries. The author didn't know the girlfriend was upset, but they should have been more aware of her feelings, especially considering the past conversation about threesomes. Maybe the author didn't do anything wrong, but there's a lack of communication from both sides. The girlfriend should have expressed her discomfort earlier, and the author could have been more considerate of her feelings. \n\nSo, considering all that, the author might not be in the wrong, but there is room for both sides to improve. The answer could be B, but there's nuance. The author didn't initiate anything, but maybe they should have been more mindful of the girlfriend's feelings given the past. However, the girlfriend's reaction seems a bit harsh if there was no intention to hurt her. I'm leaning towards B because the author didn't act with malice, but the situation highlights a communication issue rather than the author being outright wrong.\n"
