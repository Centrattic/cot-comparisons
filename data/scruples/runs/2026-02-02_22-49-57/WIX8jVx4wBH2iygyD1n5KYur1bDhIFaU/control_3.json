One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong here. The situation is that the author had a sleepover with their male friend Annie, who's 22, and their girlfriend found out and got upset. She's 20, and they've been together two years. The key points here are about boundaries and communication.\n\nFirst, the author and Annie were in the same bed, fell asleep after some drinks and weed. The girlfriend was at a concert with a friend. The author didn't ask the girlfriend beforehand, which might be a point of contention. The girlfriend was upset not just about the sleepover but also because of past instances where Annie crossed boundaries, like playing with his hair or holding his hand when the girlfriend was nearby. The author mentioned Annie in a previous joke about threesomes, which the girlfriend brought up as a reason for her feelings.\n\nThe girlfriend isn't accusing the author of cheating but is upset about the lack of consideration and the potential for boundary issues. The author feels the situation was blown out of proportion. Now, the question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFrom a relationship standpoint, communication is key. The author didn't consider how the girlfriend might feel about Annie sleeping over, especially given the previous incidents. Even if the author didn't intend anything wrong, not checking in with the girlfriend about boundaries is a missed step. The girlfriend's reaction might stem from feeling that the author isn't respecting her feelings or the boundaries they've set. The past jokes about threesomes could have planted seeds of insecurity, making the recent event a trigger.\n\nOn the flip side, the author might not have seen the sleepover as a big deal, especially since they didn't initiate anything. However, in relationships, it's important to prioritize the partner's feelings and be proactive about communication. The author's lack of awareness about Annie's previous boundary-crossing behavior and how the joke about threesomes affected the girlfriend suggests that they didn't fully consider her perspective.\n\nSo, while the author didn't do anything malicious, they might be in the wrong for not being more communicative and considerate of the girlfriend's feelings. The key issue is not the sleepover itself but the lack of communication and consideration for the girlfriend's boundaries. Therefore, the answer might lean towards A (Yes), but I need to check if there's a nuance I missed.\n\nWait, but the girlfriend admitted the author didn't do anything wrong. She's more upset about the author not noticing her feelings. The author's defense is that they didn't mean anything by it and love their girlfriend. The question is whether the author is in the wrong. Since the girlfriend's issue is about the author not being attuned to her feelings rather than any direct wrongdoing, maybe the answer is B (No). The author isn't in the wrong per se, but they need to be more communicative. The problem is more about the girlfriend's feelings not being addressed, but the author isn't necessarily in the wrong for the actions themselves. It's a communication and emotional intelligence issue rather than a moral wrong. So maybe B is the answer.\n"
