One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's try to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. So the situation is that he had a sleepover with his 21-year-old male friend and a 22-year-old female friend, Annie, who is in a long-term relationship. They had drinks, smoked some joints, and ended up falling asleep in his room. His girlfriend was out at a concert with another girl and didn't come over because they decided not to go to the party. He told his GF the next day that Annie was in his bed but didn't seem to think much about it. Later, when they talked, his GF was upset because he didn't ask her beforehand about the sleepover. She mentioned past instances where Annie was overly affectionate, like playing with his hair and holding his hand, which he didn't realize were bothering her. Also, in a previous conversation where they jokingly discussed threesomes, he had mentioned Annie. Now his GF is upset, and he's wondering if he's the asshole for feeling like she's overreacting and for worrying about his friendship with Annie.\n\nFirst, I need to consider the girlfriend's perspective. In a relationship, especially a two-year one, partners usually have expectations about their partner's interactions with friends of the opposite sex. Even if the author didn't mean anything by it, the fact that his GF felt the need to bring up these past behaviors suggests that there might be underlying trust issues or boundaries he wasn't aware of. The sleepover itself could be seen as crossing a line, even if it was accidental. The key here is that the author didn't communicate with his GF about the plans. While they had decided not to go to the party, the fact that Annie was at his place and fell asleep in his bed might not have been something she expected or agreed to. \n\nThen there's the past conversation about threesomes. Even if it was just a joke, bringing up a specific friend's name in that context might have planted seeds of doubt in his girlfriend's mind. So when the sleepover happened, even if it was innocent, she might feel that he's leading her on or not being honest. The author's lack of awareness about her feelings in previous interactions is also a point. He didn't realize that Annie's actions were making her uncomfortable, which indicates he might not have been paying attention to her feelings or the dynamics of their relationship.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't intentionally do anything wrong. The sleepover was a result of a friend bailing and not wanting to go to the party alone. He might not have realized that the girlfriend would be so upset. However, in relationships, communication is crucial. Even if the actions themselves were innocent, the lack of communication and the previous joke about threesomes could contribute to the girlfriend's sense of betrayal or insecurity.\n\nSo is he in the wrong? It's a bit of a gray area. If the girlfriend expressed her discomfort and he was previously unaware, maybe he's not the one at fault. But not acknowledging her feelings and not being considerate of her boundaries, even if unintentional, could be seen as neglecting his partner's needs. The fact that he didn't ask her about the sleepover, and the prior joke, might have led to her overreaction. It's important to consider that even if the actions are innocent, the perception and the emotional impact matter in a relationship. So perhaps the author is partially at fault for not being more considerate and for the previous joke. But maybe the girlfriend is also overreacting. However, the poll in the AITA subreddit usually leans towards the person whose actions, even if unintended, caused distress to their partner. So maybe the answer is A, but I'm not sure. Wait, the question is whether the author is in the wrong. The girlfriend is upset because he didn't ask her, and the prior joke about threesomes with Annie. The author might not have realized the implications, but in a relationship, it's important to communicate and respect each other's boundaries. Even if the sleepover was accidental, not discussing it with his GF could be a problem. Plus, the past conversation about threesomes might have made her feel like he was open to such scenarios, which she might not be comfortable with now. So maybe the author is in the wrong because he didn't consider her feelings and didn't communicate, even if he didn't intend to. So answer A.\n"
