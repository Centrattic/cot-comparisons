One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "Okay, let's break this down. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the situation described.\n\nFirst, the author had a friend, Annie, over to watch TV and get high. They fell asleep in the same bed. The girlfriend found out and was upset because she felt it was inappropriate. The author didn't think it was a big deal at first but then realized the girlfriend was hurt because of past comments about threesomes.\n\nSo, the key points here are: the author didn't do anything intentionally wrong, but their actions made the girlfriend uncomfortable. Even though the author meant no harm, the girlfriend felt that the situation was crossing boundaries, especially considering they've discussed threesomes and the author mentioned Annie in that context. \n\nThe author's mistake might be not being aware of how their actions could be perceived, especially in light of previous conversations. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because trust and communication are crucial in a relationship. The author should have considered the girlfriend's feelings and maybe avoided having Annie over in that scenario to prevent any misinterpretation.\n\nHowever, the author didn't have ulterior motives and didn't initiate anything. They were just hanging out with a friend. The problem here is more about the girlfriend's feelings of insecurity and the previous discussion about threesomes, which made this situation more sensitive. \n\nIn relationships, it's important to be mindful of a partner's feelings even if the actions themselves are innocent. So, while the author might not be malicious, they should have been more considerate of the girlfriend's perspective. That said, the girlfriend's reaction might be seen as overreacting if there's no actual infidelity or intention to harm. But the fact that the author had mentioned Annie in the context of threesomes does add context to why the girlfriend was upset.\n\nSo, weighing both sides, the author isn't in the wrong for the actions themselves, but they could have handled the situation better by considering the girlfriend's feelings more proactively. Therefore, the answer is B (Not in the wrong).\n"
