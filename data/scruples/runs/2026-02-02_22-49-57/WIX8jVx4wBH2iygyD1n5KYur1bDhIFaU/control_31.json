One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, so I need to figure out if the author is in the wrong here. Let me read through the situation again carefully.\n\nThe author is in a two-year relationship with their girlfriend. They had a sleepover with a female friend, Annie, who came over for drinks and then they both fell asleep in the author's room. The girlfriend was at a concert with another girl and didn't come back to the author's place. The next day, the author told the girlfriend about Annie sleeping in the bed. A few days later, the girlfriend confronted him, saying it was super inappropriate. She also mentioned past incidents where Annie played with his hair and held his hand while the girlfriend was nearby. The author didn't notice these things and thought they were just friends. Then the girlfriend brought up that the author had mentioned Annie in a past discussion about threesomes, which the author thought was just hypothetical and not serious. Now, the author feels the girlfriend overreacted and is worried about their friendship with Annie. The question is whether the author is in the wrong.\n\nFirst, the sleepover part. The author invited Annie over for drinks, and they ended up falling asleep. The room is the author's, so maybe there's no issue there. But in a relationship, partners often have different comfort levels. Even if the author didn't have any intentions, the girlfriend might feel uncomfortable about a friend sleeping in the same bed. The fact that they had discussed threesomes before could be a red flag for the girlfriend. Maybe she found it hypocritical or a breach of trust, especially if the author had once considered Annie in that hypothetical scenario.\n\nThen there's the past behavior. The author didn't think Annie was overstepping, but the girlfriend noticed her actions. The author's lack of awareness could be an issue. If the girlfriend felt that Annie was getting too close in the past (hair, hand-holding), and the author didn't address it, maybe the girlfriend felt the sleepover was another step in that direction. The author's not noticing these things might mean they weren't as communicative with Annie about boundaries as the girlfriend expected.\n\nBut the author didn't initiate the sleepover, and it seems like they didn't have any romantic intentions. They were just hanging out, and the situation happened naturally. The girlfriend's reaction is based on her feelings of discomfort and the past conversation about threesomes. The author isn't in the wrong for the physical act of the sleepover, but maybe they are in the wrong for not being more mindful of their girlfriend's feelings, especially after mentioning Annie in the context of threesomes. Even if it was a joke, that comment might have made the sleepover more hurtful or a trigger for the girlfriend.\n\nAlso, the author's statement that they \"thought nothing of it for the next few days\" could imply a lack of consideration. If the girlfriend had mentioned the hand-holding and hair-playing before, the author should have been more aware and maybe adjusted their behavior. The fact that they didn't notice it was bothering her might mean they were dismissive of her feelings. The girlfriend is in a long-term relationship and might have felt that the author wasn't taking her feelings into account when interacting with Annie.\n\nBut on the other hand, the author hasn't done anything explicitly wrong. There's no evidence of the author initiating anything with Annie. The sleepover was accidental, and the past actions were likely just friendly. The girlfriend's reaction is about her own insecurities and the past conversation, which the author might not have realized was significant. So the author isn't in the wrong for the actions themselves, but perhaps the girlfriend is right to feel hurt if the author wasn't aware of her feelings and didn't set boundaries with Annie.\n\nIn relationships, communication is key. The author should have discussed their interactions with Annie and their girlfriend's feelings more. Since they didn't, maybe they are partly at fault for not being more attentive to their girlfriend's perspective. However, the main issue is the girlfriend's reaction. The author's actions were unintentional, but the girlfriend's feelings are valid. The author isn't in the wrong for the actions, but maybe the girlfriend is right to be upset if she felt those boundaries were crossed. So probably the answer is B, the author is not in the wrong. But I'm a bit confused because the girlfriend's perspective is also important. Maybe the author should have been more considerate, but they didn't have malicious intent. So they're not in the wrong, but could improve communication.\n"
