One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "\nOkay, let's break this down. The user is asking if the author is in the wrong for having a sleepover with his female friend and not informing his girlfriend. The situation involves some key points. \n\nFirst, the sleepover happened. The friend, Annie, came over to drink before a party. They ended up in the bed because they fell asleep in the TV room. The girlfriend found out later, and she was upset not just about the sleepover but also about past incidents where Annie's behavior, like playing with his hair or holding his hand at a festival, made her uncomfortable. \n\nThe author didn't initiate these actions, and he didn't think they were a big deal. He also mentioned that they had joked about threesomes before, which the girlfriend felt was a factor. Now, the author is conflicted because he feels his girlfriend is overreacting and is worried about his friendship with Annie.\n\nHmm. The main issue here is boundaries in a relationship. Even though the sleepover wasn't intentional, the girlfriend's perspective is important. Trust and communication are crucial. The fact that they had previously discussed threesomes in a joking manner might have made her feel like he's open to it, leading to her insecurities. \n\nAlso, the past behaviors with Annie\u2014like holding hands and playing with hair\u2014could be seen as crossing lines, even if they were innocent. The girlfriend being in a long-term relationship herself but still feeling this way shows that it's more about how the actions made her feel. \n\nThe author didn't ask his girlfriend about the sleepover, which could be a problem. Even if it was just a friend falling asleep, not informing her might have broken trust. The girlfriend's reaction is valid because her feelings are based on the cumulative effect of these incidents and her perception of his openness to other relationships. \n\nSo, while the author may not have had malicious intent, he might be in the wrong for not considering his girlfriend's feelings and for not setting clear boundaries with Annie. The answer is likely A because the girlfriend's perspective is valid, and the author's actions, though unintentional, can be seen as careless in a committed relationship.\n"
