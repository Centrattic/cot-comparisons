One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's try to figure this out. So the user is asking if the author of the AITA post is in the wrong. The situation is that the author had a sleepover with a female friend, Annie, who fell asleep in his bed. The girlfriend found out and got upset, especially because they had previously joked about threesomes and the author mentioned Annie. The author feels the girlfriend overreacted.\n\nFirst, I need to analyze the key points here. The main issue seems to be about boundaries in a relationship. The author's friend was in his room, they watched TV, smoked, and fell asleep. The girlfriend wasn't there at the time. The author didn't intentionally do anything wrong, but maybe didn't consider the girlfriend's feelings enough. \n\nThe girlfriend's main points are: the sleepover, Annie's previous behaviors like playing with hair and holding hands, and the past joke about threesomes. The author didn't initiate the sleepover and didn't mean anything by Annie's actions before, but he did mention Annie in the context of potential threesomes. \n\nSo, was the author wrong? Well, in relationships, communication is key. Even if the author didn't think he was doing anything wrong, not considering the girlfriend's perspective is a problem. The fact that they had joked about threesomes might have led the girlfriend to feel insecure. The author should have been more aware of her feelings and maybe avoided situations that could be misinterpreted, even if the intention was innocent. \n\nAlso, the author didn't mention the sleepover immediately. He told the girlfriend the next morning, but maybe he should have been proactive in checking in with her about his interactions with Annie, especially since they had talked about threesomes before. The hyper-awareness and fear of the friendship changing might be a result of not addressing the girlfriend's concerns properly. \n\nOn the other hand, the girlfriend might be overreacting if the author's actions were genuinely innocent. But in a relationship, both partners need to respect each other's boundaries. The author's lack of awareness about the girlfriend's discomfort could be seen as neglecting to maintain those boundaries. So even if there was no malicious intent, the author might still be in the wrong for not considering his girlfriend's feelings and the potential for misinterpretation.\n"
