One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nIs the author in the wrong?

      "text": "\nOkay, let's see. The user is asking if the person who wrote this is in the wrong. The situation is about a guy having a sleepover with his female friend, not informing his girlfriend, and then the girlfriend being upset. The title is a common AITA (Am I the Asshole) scenario.\n\nFirst, I need to break down the key points. The guy had a friend, Annie, come over to his room to watch TV and they fell asleep. His girlfriend was at a concert and didn't come home, so they didn't go to the party. He didn't ask his girlfriend about the sleepover. Then the next day, he told her, but didn't think much of it. Later, the girlfriend brings up past incidents where Annie might have been too affectionate, like playing with his hair and holding hands at a festival. The author didn't notice this before. Also, he had mentioned in a joking way that he would consider a threesome with Annie, which the girlfriend now connects to the current issue.\n\nThe main question is whether the author is in the wrong for not asking his girlfriend about the sleepover and for not being aware of Annie's behavior. Also, the girlfriend's reaction is making him hyper-aware and affecting his friendship with Annie. The user wants to know if he's in the wrong or if his girlfriend overreacted.\n\nSo, I need to consider the expectations in a relationship. In many relationships, communication and transparency are key. The fact that he didn't inform his girlfriend about having a friend over in his bed might be seen as a breach of trust, even if it was accidental. The girlfriend is in a long-term relationship, and the author's actions could be perceived as violating boundaries. The girlfriend's reaction includes past behaviors that the author didn't notice, which suggests that she had been feeling neglected or insecure before this incident.\n\nAdditionally, the mention of a threesome joke could have planted a seed of doubt in the girlfriend's mind. Even if it was meant in a playful, non-serious way, the girlfriend might have taken it as a sign of interest. The author's lack of awareness about how his actions made her feel is another point. He didn't realize that the previous interactions were causing her discomfort, which is a failure in communication.\n\nOn the other hand, the author didn't initiate the physical contact with Annie and was unaware of the girlfriend's feelings. The sleepover was a result of a friend bailing, and they ended up not going to the party. But the issue is whether not asking the girlfriend and the resulting situation were wrong. The girlfriend is within her rights to feel upset, as trust is important.\n\nConsidering all this, the author might not be in the wrong for the physical contact itself, but there's a lack of communication. However, the girlfriend's concerns are valid, especially since the author had previously joked about a threesome with Annie. Not considering her perspective and not checking in with her about his actions with Annie could be where he's at fault. The answer might lean towards A (he is in the wrong) because even if the contact was accidental, not discussing it with his girlfriend and the prior joke about a threesome could contribute to her feeling that her boundaries were ignored. So, the lack of communication and not respecting her potential insecurities by having Annie over unannounced might be the issue here.\n"
