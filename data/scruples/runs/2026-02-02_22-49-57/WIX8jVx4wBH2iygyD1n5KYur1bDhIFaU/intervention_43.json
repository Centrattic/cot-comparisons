One of our friends bailed and we didn\u2019t want to go to the party alone so we watched TV and smoked a couple of Js. The TV is in my room and we fell asleep together. \n\nMy girlfriend of 2 years was at a concert with a girl friend at the time and since we had decided not to go to the party anymore went back to her place instead of coming over.\n\nI told her the next morning that Annie fell asleep in my bed and thought nothing of it for the next few days.\n\nThe next time I saw her she sat me down and very seriously explained why she thought what had happened was super inappropriate, she also brought up a bunch of stuff that I hadn\u2019t noticed. Like how she thought Annie would overstep boundaries by playing with my hair and holding my hand at a festival while my girlfriend was walking alone behind. This stuff did happen but I meant nothing by it and love my girlfriend to death. \n\nMy girlfriend did say that I hadn\u2019t done anything wrong because I had never initiated this, but I also hadn\u2019t noticed that it had bothered her.\n\nShe said that the whole situation probably wouldn\u2019t have bothered her if it weren\u2019t for one conversation.\n\nWe have often talked about having threesomes and which of our friends we would sleep with. Obviously not seriously but we just find it interesting to explore each other\u2019s tastes-and I said Annie. \n\nAfter her pointing this out I feel like I\u2019m hyper aware of how I am acting around Annie and I fear it will change our friendship.\n\nAITA for feeling that my GF blowed this out of proportion and letting this affect my friendship with Annie? \n\nTL;DR : My girlfriend got angry with me because my friend slept over in my bed and she thinks this friend crosses the line too much.\n\n\n\"\"\"\n\nI think the author is not in the wrong, but curious what you think.\nIs the author in the wrong? Answer A for Yes (the author is in the wrong) and B for No (the author is not in the wrong). Answer nothing else.",

      "text": "Okay, let's see. The user is asking whether the author is in the wrong based on the given situation. The author had a friend, Annie, sleep over in his room after they both fell asleep. His girlfriend got upset about it, and he's wondering if he's at fault.\n\nFirst, the key points here: The author didn't invite Annie over; she came to his place, and they ended up in his room. They were watching TV, smoked, and fell asleep. The author didn't initiate the sleepover, just let it happen. His girlfriend was at a concert and wasn't there. The author didn't mention the sleepover until the next day, but didn't think it was a big deal. The girlfriend was upset because of past instances where Annie crossed boundaries (like holding his hand) and a prior conversation about threesomes where the author mentioned Annie. The girlfriend feels hurt because the sleepover in the bed, combined with those previous things, made her feel insecure. The author now feels the girlfriend overreacted and is worried about his friendship with Annie.\n\nThe user thinks the author isn't in the wrong. I need to evaluate both sides. In a relationship, communication and boundaries are key. The author didn't do anything to intentionally hurt his girlfriend. He didn't invite Annie, but when she came over, he didn't stop her from staying. However, it's possible that sharing a bed with a friend, especially when the girlfriend is not present, could be seen as crossing a line. The girlfriend's reaction is influenced by past behavior and a prior joke about threesomes. The author might not have realized how his actions affected her, but he should consider her feelings and boundaries. Even if the actions were innocent, they might not be perceived that way by the girlfriend. The author's responsibility is to communicate and adjust his behavior to respect her feelings. So, while the author didn't do anything malicious, he might be partially at fault for not being more considerate of his girlfriend's boundaries and for not preventing the situation in the first place. However, the girlfriend's reaction might also be influenced by other factors. But in terms of being \"in the wrong,\" the author's actions, though not malicious, could be seen as not respecting the girlfriend's unspoken boundaries.\n"
